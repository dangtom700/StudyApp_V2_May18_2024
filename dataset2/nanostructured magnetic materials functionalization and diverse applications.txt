Preface
In the recent development of modern society, magnetic materials play a vital role 
in the advancement of every cutting- edge technology. These specific materials are 
applied to various devices, including motors, devices for the generation and trans￾mission of power, electronics, medical devices, sensors, intelligent drug delivery 
systems, scientific equipment, etc. The scientific world is much attracted toward 
nanotechnology due to the remarkable advancements that have been made in this 
field over the past few decades. The nanoscale dimension of nanostructured materi￾als results in various beneficial consequences, including confinement effects, large 
surface-to-volume ratios, promising transport capabilities, a wide range of physical 
characteristics, and fast access to a wide range of these qualities. The use of magnetic 
nanoparticles for photocatalytic, energy conversion and storage, water purification, 
detoxification, and environmental and biomedical applications has been investigated 
in depth. Due to the several v alue- a dded properties of the finished product, surface 
modification or functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles is quite desirable for 
any particular application. This modification is necessary due to the multifunctional 
nature of the final result. The surface properties of the nanomaterials are signifi￾cant because they interact with the world around them. This interaction is especially 
significant for nanomaterials in which surface properties are notably distinct from 
their bulk properties due to changes in their physico- chemical properties. Hence, the 
investigation of the surface properties is one of the critical elements.
In recent years, the application of magnetic nanoparticles in the active layers of 
solar cells has increased power conversion efficiency. Due to the magnetic effect 
of nanoparticles, more charge carriers dissolved, increasing open circuit volt￾age. Technological advancements and morphological improvements are needed to 
enhance the energy conversion capacity of magnetic nanomaterials. The utilization 
of magnetic nanomaterials/ nanocomposites for solar energy harvesting is one of the 
new directions of the renewable energy conversion process. Magnetic nanoparticles 
are excellent electroactive materials for electrochemical energy storage, especially in 
supercapacitors. The external magnetic field or the magnetic effect of the electrode/ -
device components can influence its electrochemical performance. Especially, the 
influence of an external magnetic field on the electrochemical performance of the 
material plays a very crucial role. Magnetic semiconducting nanoparticles have lately 
gained attention in photocatalysis due to their UV and visible light efficiency and 
magnetic recoverability. The material’s photocatalytic performance is limited by 
charge recombination, surface area, and stability. This problem can be met through 
covalent or noncovalent functionalization, surface modification, nanocomposites 
with metal oxides, 2D materials, and other techniques. Traditional synthesis methods 
use hazardous reducing agents, capping agents, and surfactants to control process 
parameters. This causes an ecosystem imbalance. Green synthesis is a nontoxic, cost- 
 effective, biocompatible, and ecologically acceptable means to create nanoparticles 
from plant extracts. In green synthesis, plant extracts are used to reduce, cap, and sta￾bilize nanomaterials. Several methods exist for this. Magnetic nanoparticles ( PMNs) viii Preface
made from plants are nontoxic, affordable, and environmentally beneficial. Failure 
to purify effluents and hazardous pollutants before releasing them into water bodies 
causes various diseases. Current technologies can’t remove poisons from water bod￾ies. PMNPs, which may remove toxins by more than 95%, are gaining popularity as 
a way to restore our environment to its natural state.
Every year, data storage device technique, mechanism, and materials improve. 
The quest for cheap data storage drove the swift decline in size and cost per gigabyte 
of data and the rapid development in areal density. Magnetic tape was replaced by 
hard disk drives, a kind of magnetic r andom- a ccess memory ( MRAM). Despite the 
rise of other data capturing and storage systems, magnetic data storage continues 
to expand. This allows additional reading and writing heads and disks per drive. 
Modern hard disk drives are based on perpendicular magnetic recording ( PMR), 
heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), two-dimensional magnetic recording 
(TDMR), and heated-dot magnetic recording (HDMR). The current standard for 
areal density is 10 TB/ in2 ( PMR) ( HDMR). Future magnetic recording and stor￾age technologies will use many magnetic materials and methods. The strategies for 
producing magnetic materials, surface functionalization to improve magnetic-based 
storage performance/ areal density, and their advancement need an attention. The 
magnetic nanoparticles, among other types, have intrinsic properties successfully 
used for biomedical applications such as bioimaging, drug delivery, chemotherapy, 
magnetic hyperthermia, biosensors, and regenerative medicine.
The purpose of this book is to discuss the numerous bio- and physio-chemical 
approaches of l ong- term functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles and their corre￾sponding applications. In addition, we go over the many physiochemical techniques 
for characterizing materials and their functional groups on the surface. The chapters 
in our book are all filled with information that we believe will be interesting to our 
readers.ix

1.1 MAGNETIC NANOMATERIALS
Among the nanomaterials, magnetic nanomaterials ( MNMs) are found to be inter￾esting due to their specific magnetic characteristics depending on the crystal struc￾ture and magnetic nature of the material [ 1– 5]. Furthermore, MNMs with optimal 
magnetic characteristics will be required for some specific applications such as 
magnetic separation, magnetic hyperthermia, magnetic data storage, and magnetic 
 field- assisted applications [ 6– 8]. The phase formation of MNMs during the synthesis 
or postsynthesis process with thermal annealing is a key parameter to achieve the 
required magnetic phase of MNMs [ 9– 14]. The size and stoichiometry of MNMs 
could be tuned during the synthesis by adjusting the experimental parameters and 
also by postthermal treatments [ 15– 19]. Further surface modification MNMs could 
be utilized for various applications with multifunctional characteristics [ 19– 22]. The 
interaction of the interparticles as well as the foreign material used for surface modi￾fication is critical in determining the synergistic impact in the final form of function￾alized magnetic nanomaterials (f-MNMs) [23,24] (Figure 1.1).
As a result of the analysis done by the VOS viewer, a variety of magnetic nano￾materials are explored, each of which has its own unique set of functional, physical, 
and chemical properties. As a consequence, these materials investigate a variety of 
different applications in a number of different fields. In addition to this, an increase 
 
FIGURE  1.1 A bibliometric analysis using VOS viewer of publications retrieved by 
SCOPUS.Functionalized Magnetic Nanomaterials and Their Applications 3
in several disciplines has been noticed as a result of the scale par. In this context, we 
would organize and focus our book on the fundamental concepts related to the syn￾thesis and functionalization of magnetic nanomaterials, and then we would diverge 
into the applications of these concepts in the fields of biomedical applications, energy 
conversion, energy storage, water treatment, and data storage. In this chapter, we dis￾cuss various synthesis methods, different surface modifier which could be used for 
the functionalization of MNPs, and the possible applications of functionalized MNPs.
1.2 SYNTHESIS OF MAGNETIC NANOMATERIALS
Numerous synthesis methods were available for the synthesis of MNM such as 
coprecipitation, chemical oxidation process, polyol process, sol- gel process, and ball 
milling, and they could be selected based on the nature of the MNMs [ 25– 29]. The 
selection of the synthesis process for the synthesis of MNMs is important as the final 
particles’ size and shape will be depending on the synthesis methods and the experi￾mental parameters adopted.
1.2.1 C opreCipitation Method
To get a s maller- sized MNM, the coprecipitation method is suitable for any MNM. 
The advantage of this coprecipitation method is that it could produce m ono- sized 
particles. By adjusting the starting precursors, we could adjust the stoichiometry of 
the final particles and also stoichiometry could be altered by doping of foreign metal 
ions. The particle size of the MNPs could be tuned by reaction temperature and post￾thermal treatment. The coprecipitation method cannot be used where the larger- sized 
MNPs were required. However, the doping of metal ions into specific ferrite could 
be achieved through the coprecipitation method. A recent report discussed the suc￾cessful stoichiometry modification by selective metal ion doping into Fe3O4. Studies 
[30] suggest that the stoichiometry variation could alter the magnetic characteristics, 
which could enhance the efficiency in a specific application of the samples, even 
though the particles are similar in size. The M n- a nd C o- doped Fe3O4 are shown in 
 Figure 1.2. The variation in the Curie transition temperature was estimated from the 
thermos gravimetric analysis, and the Hopkinson peak shifts between 529°C and 
590°C were observed corresponding to the doping of the prepared ferrites [30].
1.2.2 C heMiCal oxidation Method
To achieve larger- sized MNPs, a chemical oxidation process could be adopted as 
this process will have an opportunity to tune the particle’s size by varying the oxi￾dation or precipitant agent through a modified chemical oxidation process. Further 
size reduction can also be achieved in the modified chemical oxidation process by 
introducing the nucleating agent during the reaction. The major advantage of this 
modified chemical oxidation process is that it does not require a high- cost nucleating 
agent. Even with the metal ions, we could reduce the particle size.
 Mn– Zn ferrite was attempted to synthesize large- sized particles through a modified

concentration [31]. Ferric ions were used to further reduce the particle size. The XRD 
pattern of the ferrites prepared with ferric ions ( 35%) and KNO3 concentrations of 0.09 
and 0.2 M is shown in Figure 1.3( i). The overall size variation with KNO3 concentra￾tion and ferric ions is shown in F igure 1.3( ii). Similarly, Fe3O4 MNPs were developed 
through a modified chemical oxidation process with ferric ions for size reduction [32]. 
When the ferric ions employed in this approach were increased from 10% to 200%, the 
process converted into a coprecipitation process due to the 1:2 ratio of ferrous to ferric 
ions. The average particle sizes were tuned from 10 to 45 nm, and the variation in the 
magnetic characteristics due to the size reduction can be observed in Figure 1.3( iii). 
The saturation magnetization of the ferrites was tuned between 62 and 90 emu/ g.

The above-d iscussed synthesis process cannot be used to synthesize the metal 
or metal alloy MNS as both processes are involved in the w ater- based synthesis Functionalized Magnetic Nanomaterials and Their Applications 5

process. The use of water during the metal or metal alloy synthesis could eas￾ily form the metal hydroxide through the chemical reaction, and further thermal 
energy may produce the magnetic metal oxides or any other impurity phase. The 
polyol process could be utilized for the synthesis of metal or alloy MNMs without 
any impurity phase. One of the issues in the polyol process is it will be required 
some costly chemicals such as polyols and it is required a tricky washing pro￾cedure to remove the polyols and unreacted products. The selection of polyols 
for the synthesis of MNMs is important as it is reported that the particle size of 
Fe MNMs could be varied with different polyols such as propylene glycol ( PG), 
ethylene glycol (E G), and trimethylene glycol ( TMEG) [26]. The starting precur￾sors, solvent, and reaction temperature could result in the purity of the metal NPs. 
Along with the previously listed characteristics, metal to hydroxyl ions play an 
important role in the reduction of metal NPs.
The synthesis process and time duration will be different for various MNPs. 
Fe MNPs can be reduced instantly, whereas the reduction of FePt could take more 
time to complete the reaction to form the alloy phase. F igure 1.4 shows the experi￾mental setup, which could be used for the synthesis of alloy and metal MNPs. The 
particle size of metal NPs could be reduced by introducing nucleating agents such 
as Pt, Pd, and Ag before or during the chemical reaction. Fe MNPs’ sizes were 
tuned between 10 and 90 nm through the polyol process with Pt precursor as a 
nucleating agent.
Other synthesis methods such as hydrothermal, microemulsion, solvothermal, 
reflex, and electrochemical processes can also be utilized for the development of 
various MNPs.
1.3 FUNCTIONALIZATION OF MAGNETIC 
NANOMATERIALS
Functionalization is important to improve the efficient characteristics of MNPs for 
any specific applications. Functionalization is also considered as a surface modifica￾tion process but with the conjugation or any other biomolecules for better surface 
characteristics. The interaction between the surface modifier and MNPs is important 6 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
FIGURE 1.5 Different between the ( a) nonfunctionalized and (b ) functionalized particle’s 
dipolar interactions. Reproduced with permission from [35] Copyright (2 020) Elsevier.
to have stable f -M NPs. F- MNPs have several advantages such as nonagglomeration 
and enhance physicochemical characteristics over the bare MNPs. For the applica￾tions of f- MNPs in detoxification or any other heavy metal ion adsorption, MNPs 
could be functionalized with a specific surface modifier based on the selection of 
metal ions to be removed.
The functionalization requires a little optimization for better surface modification. 
Because some surface modifiers may not be able to effectively connect to the surface 
of MNPs. To avoid improper functionalization, MNPs could be pretreated with mild 
acids to achieve complete functionalization with a surface modifier. The improved 
surface attachment of the surface modifier with the acid treatment of Fe3O4 with 
hydrochloric acid was evident from several recent reports [20]. The functionaliza￾tion could improve the interparticle interactions and reduce the dipolar interactions 
because of the increase in the distance between the two particles [35]. The removal 
of dipolar interaction due to the surface functionalization is explained schematically 
in Figure 1.5.
For any specific applications, agglomeration should be avoided to utilize a maxi￾mum contribution from particles. Numerous polymeric compounds could be utilized 
to avoid agglomeration through the surface modification of MNPs.
1.4 APPLICATIONS OF FUNCTIONALIZED 
MAGNETIC NANOMATERIALS
Functionalized MNPs could be used for various applications including energy stor￾age, energy conversion, water purification, degradation of pollutants, magnetoptical, 
detoxification, hyperthermia, and other bio- related applications. As we discussed in 
earlier sections, the synthesis methods and surface modifier could be selected for any 
particular applications to obtain the synergic effect from MNPs and also from the 
surface modifier. Various synthesis methods, materials used for the functionaliza￾tion, and their applications are shown in F igure 1.6.Functionalized Magnetic Nanomaterials and Their Applications 7

1.5 FROM FUNDAMENTALS OF SURFACE CHARACTERIZATION 
TECHNIQUES INTO DIVERSE APPLICATIONS
Nanotechnology has been advancing rapidly in the last decade, which has attracted 
the interest of the scientific community. In point of fact, the advances in nanotechnol￾ogy have made it possible to obtain new synthetic materials for use in a diverse array 
of applications, including medicine, energy conversion, energy storage, technology, 
industry, water treatment, and data storage, to name a few. Because of the growing 
need to understand the properties of emerging nanomaterials, surface characterisa￾tion approaches have grown in significance.
Surfaces are important because of their interaction with the surrounding envi￾ronment, particularly because the surface properties of nanomaterials differ sig￾nificantly from their bulk properties due to differences in their physical structure 
and chemistry. This makes studying surfaces a relevant topic. On the other hand, 
magnetic nanoparticles have attracted a significant amount of attention over the past 
20 years due to their application in the field of cancer treatment as a method of con￾trolled medication administration. The capping of nanoparticles has proven to be a 
significant obstacle in the synthesis and characterization of magnetic nanomaterials 
such as iron oxide. This is because some of the nanoparticles are highly reactive 
and susceptible to oxidation, both of which can alter the magnetic behavior of the 
material. The complexity of nanoparticles’ surface properties necessitates the use of 
methodologies typically used for characterizing surfaces to the investigation of the 
properties of nanomaterials.
Other methods, such as doping or the synthesis of composites, have also been 
established in order to achieve modified properties, in addition to the various types 
of synthesis that have been created for magnetic nanomaterials in order to obtain 
these modified properties. As a consequence of this, surface characterizations should 
be reliable approaches for obtaining information regarding the chemical, structural, 
morphological, magnetic, and electrical properties of the innovative nanomaterials 
that are continually being developed.
In the chapter titled “ Surface Characterization Techniques,” we make an effort 
to provide surface characterization techniques that are both unique and useful to the 
study of magnetic nanoparticles. In addition, procedures are divided into component 
parts, and their underlying physical concepts are discussed for enhanced comprehen￾sion. This chapter details the prerequisites for sample preparation, and the benefits 
and drawbacks of the approaches are discussed.
Nanostructured materials instantly provide a number of benefits, including large 
surface- to- volume ratios, promising transport capabilities, a variety of physical prop￾erties, and confinement effects as a result of the nanoscale size. These nanomaterials 
have been explored in depth for use in applications linked to energy, including solar 
cells, catalysts, thermoelectric, l ithium- ion batteries, supercapacitors, and hydrogen 
storage devices. In more recent times, the presence of magnetic nanoparticles in the 
active layer of solar cell devices has greatly contributed to the overall power conver￾sion efficiency of the devices. Because of the magnetic field that is inherent to the 
nanoparticles, the devices had a greater number of charge carriers that had become 
dissociated, which resulted in an increased open circuit voltage. It is emphasized Functionalized Magnetic Nanomaterials and Their Applications 9
that innovative methods and structures will likely be necessary in order to greatly 
improve the capacity of magnetic nanostructured materials to convert energy. The 
uses of magnetic functional nanomaterials and nanocomposites including magnetic 
nanoparticles for converting solar energy will be the primary focus of this chapter.
For electrochemical energy storage, particularly in the context of supercapacitor 
application, magnetic nanoparticles are utilized as efficient electrodes. The electro￾chemical performance of an electrode that is based on magnetic nanomaterials can 
be influenced either by an external magnetic field or by the magnetism that is pos￾sessed by the materials that make up the electrode. This chapter discusses recent 
developments in research on magnetic nanomaterials, their composite materials for 
the use of electrochemical energy storage, and the influence of an external magnetic 
field on the electrochemical performance of the material. In conclusion, we discuss 
the opportunities and difficulties presented by these magnetic nanomaterials as a 
potential contender for the storage of energy.
In the field of photocatalysis, magnetic semiconducting nanoparticles have 
recently garnered increased attention due to their superior efficiency in UV and 
visible light, as well as the fact that they are magnetically recoverable and reus￾able. The high rate of charge recombination, the magnetic nanomaterial’s surface 
area, and its stability all act as limitations on the photocatalytic performance of 
the material. This challenge can be met through the functionalization of magnetic 
nanoparticles, which can be accomplished through either covalent or noncovalent 
functionalization, surface modification, production of nano composites with metal 
oxides, 2D materials, and other approaches. On the other hand, traditional methods 
of synthesis involve the use of potentially toxic reducing agents, capping agents, and 
surfactants in order to control the various parameters of the synthesis process. This 
can also generate an environmental imbalance in the ecosystem. When it comes to 
creating nanoparticles with plant extracts, one of the alternative ways that is also 
nontoxic, c ost- effective, biocompatible, and environmentally friendly is known as 
the green synthesis method. In the green synthesis process, the extract of a plant 
( seed, fruit, leaf, peel, etc.) is utilized as a reducing, capping, and stabilizing agent 
to regulate the size and shape of the nanomaterials. This can be done in a number 
of different ways.
The production of magnetic nanoparticles from plant- based materials ( plant￾based magnetic nanoparticles, PMNPs) is not only nontoxic but also economical 
and friendly to the environment. The failure to properly cleanse effluents and haz￾ardous wastes before releasing them into neighboring water bodies is the underly￾ing cause of many different diseases. The elimination of toxins from water bodies 
using technologies that are currently prevalent is ineffective. The use of PMNPs, 
which have been reported to reach an efficiency of removing contaminants of 
more than 95%, has gained traction as a means of returning our environment to 
the natural and unspoiled state it once occupied. As a result, the purpose of this 
study is to discuss the feasible applications of phytogenic MNPs in the treatment 
of wastewater.
Every year, the process, mechanism, and materials that are utilized in the 
development of data storage devices see improvements. The desire for data stor￾age at cheap prices was the driving force behind the quick fall in size and cost per 10 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
gigabyte of data, as well as the rapid growth in areal density that accompanied it. 
The technology used for magnetic recording and storing progressed from mag￾netic tape to hard disk drives ( HDD), which are a type of magnetic random- access 
memory ( MRAM). In spite of the emergence of various methods for the record￾ing and storing of data, m agnetic- based data storage is continuing to grow in area 
density. This allows more reading and writing heads as well as disks to be packed 
onto a single drive. Researchers have made consistent efforts to increase the capac￾ity of magnetic recording media, which has resulted in the development of mod￾ern hard disk drives that are based on perpendicular magnetic recording ( PMR), 
heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), two-dimensional magnetic recording
( TDMR), and heated- dot magnetic recording ( HDMR). The areal density of con￾temporary technology has increased to 10 TB/ in2 from the previous standard of 1 
TB/in2 ( PMR) ( HDMR). The development of future magnetic recording and stor￾age technology will involve utilization of a wide variety of magnetic materials and 
approaches. This chapter discusses the various methods for developing magnetic 
materials, surface functionalization which is required to improve the performance/ 
areal density of magnetic- based storage tools, and their respective progresses. In 
addition, the various methods for developing magnetic materials are broken down 
into their respective subtopics.
1.6 SUMMARY, SCOPE, AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The magnetic characteristics of the MNMs could be tuned by adjusting the syn￾thesis experimental parameters, utilizing the surface modification/ functionalization 
and postthermal treatment. By selecting the suitable surface modifier, we can make 
MNMs as multifunctional NM. The nonmagnetic fraction in hybrid MNMs after 
the surface functionalization can reduce the saturation magnetization of MNM. 
However, other magnetic characteristics could be improved by a suitable selec￾tion of surface modifiers or by making effective interparticle interactions. The 
functionalization strategies are important key parameters to achieve the required 
magnetic or any other multifunctional characteristics for any specific application. 
Functionalized MNMs could be used in various applications such as photocatalysts, 
energy production/ conversion/ storage, magnetic separation, sensors, and biomedi￾cal applications. Recently, a few studies have shown a remarkable improvement in 
the efficiency of f- MNM in electrochemical applications with an external magnetic 
field. The magnetic characteristics of f - MNMs and the amount of external magnetic 
field can play an important role in the final efficiency. The magnetic characteristics 
of f- MNM can be advantageous over the separation and removal after the comple￾tion of specific applications. The collected f- MNMs can be evaluated for the next 
cyclic performance to evaluate the reusability of f- MNM. The magnetic field- assisted 
applications need more attention, as they have to be further explored in various appli￾cations. There is a lot of scope on the functionalized MNMs as MNMs could show 
some additional efficiency when interacting with an external magnetic field. The 
effect of an external magnetic field in various applications with the suitable selection 
of MNM and surface functionalization needs to look at in detail for possible practical 
applications.Functionalized Magnetic Nanomaterials and Their Applications 11

2.1 I NTRODUCTION TO SURFACE 
CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES
Nanotechnology has been developing recently with a great interest among scientific 
community, and in fact, its advances allowed the obtaining of new synthetic materi￾als in a wide range of applications like medical, technological, domestic, industrial, 
biological, and agricultural, among others. In order to understand the properties of 
the emerging nanomaterials, surface characterization techniques are important to 
understand these materials ( Gandhi 2022).
On one hand, surfaces become relevant since their interaction with the environ￾ment, especially the surface properties of nanomaterials deviate considerably from 
the bulk properties owing to a difference in physical structure and chemistry (K lein 
et al. 2008). On the other hand, magnetic nanomaterials have received considerable 
attention in the last two decades due to their usage for controlled drug delivery in 
cancer treatments ( Gul et al. 2019). A big challenge in the synthesis and characteriza￾tion of magnetic nanomaterials like iron oxide has been the capping of nanoparticles, 
since some of them are highly reactive and prone to oxidation affecting their mag￾netic behavior. The complexity of surface properties of nanomaterials leads to the 
translation of surface characterization techniques to study their properties (G ul et al. 
2019; Araujo et al. 2020).
Besides, different types of synthesis for magnetic nanomaterials have been devel￾oped in order to obtain modified properties, as well as other techniques like doping 
or the synthesis of composites ( Bertolucci et al. 2015). Due to this, surface charac￾terizations should be reliable techniques for obtaining information of the structural, 
chemical, morphological, magnetic, and electrical properties of the novel nanomate￾rials which emerge day by day.
In this work, we intend to show novel surface characterization techniques for 
magnetic nanomaterials. Furthermore, techniques are explained in detail and their 
physical principles are mentioned for a better understanding. The advantages and 
limitations of the techniques are present in this chapter and the requirements for 
sample preparation are described.
2.2 CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATIONS
2.2.1 definition of CheMiCal CharaCterizations
Chemical characterizations such as Raman spectroscopy or X -r ay photoelectron 
spectroscopy ( XPS) provide chemical structure information of the elements or com￾pounds in a sample. Despite the two techniques that are able to give the same infor￾mation in appearance, there are several substantial differences among them. Besides, 
XPS can quantify the amount of each element in a sample without the necessity 
of an external reference, but it cannot measure some elements such as hydrogen. Surface Characterization Techniques 17
Furthermore, through infrared and Raman spectroscopies, the composition of a 
sample can be inferred not by its elements but by the chemical compounds in the 
material. For instance, in typical infrared or Raman spectra, as a fingerprint, sev￾eral bands related to the bonds or vibration modes of molecules appear. Thus, the 
researcher is allowed to identify which chemical compounds ( and the elements form￾ing the compounds) are in the material. In this section, several chemical character￾izations and the involved mechanisms will be presented.
2.2.2 ir speCtrosCopy
Materials science tries to describe different interactions like temperature, mechani￾cal deformation, and irradiation with the matter to mention some of them. This sec￾tion will focus on the interaction between irradiation and matter. It is well known 
that there is a range in the radiation spectrum that energetically could excite elec￾trons and/ or molecules to energy levels greater than the basal energy state in which 
the electrons or molecules are found, e.g., the ultraviolet region. However, there is 
a region of the radiation spectrum that energetically does not have the ability to 
generate these changes, but what it can produce is a change in the vibrational energy 
of the molecule. This region goes from 750 to 1 × 106 nm; which, in turn, is divided 
into three regions: the near ( 750– 2,500 nm), middle ( 2, 500– 14,900 nm), and far 
(14,900–1× 106 nm) ( Skoog, Holler, and Crouch 2021). It is important to mention at 
this point that the region of greatest interest in the characterization of materials is 
the mid- IR region. To study this region, the emission as well as the absorption and 
 reflection spectra are analyzed and used for analyses either qualitative or quantita￾tive. On the other hand, the near- IR region is often useful for the quantitative deter￾mination of certain species, such as water, carbon dioxide, sulfur, and low molecular 
weight hydrocarbons ( Skoog, Holler, and Crouch 2021). Unlike the m id- IR, the inter￾action that is used is the diffuse reflectance spectra of samples that can be in liquid 
or solid form without previous treatment or in gas absorption studies. As regards 
the far infrared region, it is useful for determining the structures of inorganic and 
organometallic species by analyzing absorption measurements ( Skoog, Holler, and 
Crouch 2021).
2.2.2.1 Mid-IR Spectroscopy
The basic questions that mid- IR spectroscopy can answer are as follows: What mol￾ecules are present in the sample? Can two samples be identical or is there a difference 
between them? And finally, do you know what are the concentrations of molecules 
in this sample? The first can be answered by locating and associating the positions 
of the peaks in the infrared spectrum, which are correlated with the molecular struc￾ture. The second question can be answered by correlating an unknown spectrum with 
a reference spectrum and seeing how well the positions, heights, and widths of the 
peaks in the two curves matched. So, IR spectra will always have significant differ￾ences if the samples are different. Finally, this characterization method allows know￾ing the concentrations of various molecules by measuring the spectra of samples 
of known concentration and then using Beer’s law to prepare a calibration line that 
relates absorbance to concentration ( Skoog, Holler, and Crouch 2021).

FIGURE 2.2 Schematic representation of the s ignal– m atter interaction: ( a) 1 Hz frequency, 
( b) 2 Hz frequency, ( c) 3 Hz frequency, and ( d) 4 Hz frequency. In all the cases, the frequency 
value is emitted by a source and the signal interacts with a carbon and oxygen bond.
The basic idea of how IR spectroscopy works is described by the following exam￾ple: Let us consider a molecule that is formed by a bond between a carbon and an 
oxygen atom as shown in Figure 2.1. This bond could be vibrating, in contraction 
or elongation ( with a frequency of 2 Hz) with respect to the “z” axis, as shown in 
 Figure 2.1a. On the other hand, it could also be oscillating like a pendulum in the 
“y–z” plane, with a frequency of 4 Hz, see Figure 2.1b. With these values of natural 
vibration of the bond as a basis, now let us suppose a radiation with a frequency of 
1 Hz as an incidence signal. As shown in Figure 2.2a, the signal when it interacts with 
the molecule does not match with the natural vibration frequency of the molecule, 
this signal passes throughout without interacting and reaches the detector 100% of 
the signal. But if the source modifies the signal and generated a signal with a fre￾quency of 2 Hz ( Figure 2.2b), when this signal interacts with the molecule since this 
frequency match with the frequency of elongation or contraction, the signal will be 
absorbed by the molecule and the detector will not receive the signal (t he molecule 
absorbed the radiation). Now, let us consider that the signal is generated with a 3 Hz 
frequency, the interaction behavior could be the same as the signal at 1 Hz, and it 
will arrive at the detector without any modification (F igure 2.2c). With a 4 Hz signal, 
it could happen that it is totally absorbed because this molecule has a vibration with 
FIGURE 2.1 Schematic representation of a carbon and oxygen bond: ( a) a contraction or 
elongation of the bond with a frequency value of 2 Hz and ( b) a vibrational in plane y–z of the 
bond with a frequency value of 4 Hz.Surface Characterization Techniques 19
this frequency; however, it can happen that the signal could be attenuated, and a per￾centage of the signal can pass through the molecule; let’s say 50% less of the signal 
( see Figure 2.2d). If the signal is not totally absorbed by the molecule, it might be due 
to various interactions between the signal and the molecule.
We can observe from Figure 2.2 that the absorption of radiation by the mol￾ecule is reflected in the IR spectrum, and the changes in transmittance are 
mainly associated with a vibration type between the different elements. Based 
on this, as we have already described, IR spectroscopy has been one of the 
most developed characterization techniques to know the type of molecule or 
compound that is being formed in the material under study. From these stud￾ies; two regions have been found, the region that goes from 4,000 to 1,500 cm−1
is called the region of fundamental bands or functional groups, and the region 
from 1,500 to 200 cm−1 is called fingerprints. The last is the one with the most 
valuable information to be able to distinguish the elements that compound the 
molecules. On the other hand, vibrations have been classified into two fami￾lies ( Mitsuo Tasumi 2014): ( i) Stretching, longitudinal, or tension (ν) where the 
distance between the atoms that form the union is the one that varies during a 
vibration, and, in turn, this is classified as symmetric or asymmetric stretching 
( see Figure 2.3a and b), respectively.
( ii) Deformation or flexion (δ): It is associated with a difference in the angle 
formed between atoms due to the vibration caused by the interaction of the radiation 
with the molecule. This is divided into in-plane swing, in-plane scissoring, out-of￾plane flapping, and out-of-plane twisting (see Figure 2.4).
Finally, it has been found that hydrogen stretching occurs in the region of 
3,600–2,500 cm−1, where it can be found that the absorption is related with the 
vibrational stretching of hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. 
On the other hand, triple bonds have been found in the region between 2,300 and 
2,000 cm−1, and in this so- called region, the absorption is related to vibrational 
stretching vibration of the triple bonds. In the double bond ( 1, 900 – 1,550 cm−1), 
the absorption process is correlated with the vibrational stretching of the carbon– 
 oxygen, carbon– nitrogen, and ca rbon– carbon double bonds. Lastly, the hydrogen 
bending is between 1,600 and 1,250 cm−1; in this case, the absorption is commonly 
due to the bending vibrations of the hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon and nitrogen 
( Skoog, Holler, and Crouch 2021).

compound, and the plus and minus signs represent the movement out of the plane or enter to 
the plane, respectively.
2.2.2.2 Mathematical Analysis
The location of these absorption bands in the IR spectrum can be predicted by a 
mathematical expression that represents the vibrational motion of two atoms that 
form the chemical bond (P eter Larkin 2017). Characteristics of elongation or con￾traction vibrations are usually represented with a mechanical model that consists of 
two massive bodies joined by a spring, as shown in Figure 2.5. The deformation; x, 
produced by one of these masses along the spring axis, produces a vibration called 
simple harmonic motion.
To obtain the mathematical relation that describes the motion of this system, we 
should consider the vibration of only one mass; m1, which will be attached to a spring 
that is suspended, as shown in Figure 2.6.
Now, if the mass deforms the spring a distance “x” from equilibrium point, the 
spring will apply a force contrary to the movement this force is considered as a 
restoring force F, which is proportional at displacement x, the relationship between 
these two variables is well described by Hooke’s law; F = −k x. Being k the spring 
constant, the minus sign in the equation indicates a force that opposes the applied 
force by m1.
To describe the movement of m1, as a function of time “t”, it is necessary to 
remember Newton’s second law that establishes F = m × a, where for our case m = m1, 
and the acceleration “a” according to the fundamentals of classical mechanics is as 
follows:Surface Characterization Techniques 21
FIGURE 2.5 Schematic representation of motion of a chemical bond of two atoms.
FIGURE 2.6 Schematic representation of motion of an atom.
For the case of the time description of the mass attached to a spring, it can match 
Hooke’s law and Newton’s second law to obtain the following equation:
d x2
m1     = −k x (2.2) dt 2
To solve this second-d egree differential equation, we can propose a function for “x” 
whose second derivative is equal to the original function. This condition is met by 
the Sine function. Therefore, the instantaneous shift of m1 at time t can be expressed 
as follows:
x = A S    in ( ) ωt (2.3)22 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
where ω is the angular frequency. Then, by applying a second derivative to the dis￾placement function, we can obtain the following equation:
−m A 2 1    ω ω Sin t ( ) = −k A   Sin t     ( ) ω (2.4)
By simplifying and remembering that the angular frequency is related to the linear 
frequency as ω = 2 π ν, we obtain the relationship for the natural frequency of oscil￾lation for the system as follows:
1 k
ν = (2.5) 2 π m1
Now, we can rewrite this relationship as a function of wavelength, looking back that 
ν = c/ λ, so we can rewrite equation 2.1 as follows:
1 k
ν = (2.6) 2 π     c m1
This relationship can be modified in order to explain the conduct of a system, which 
includes two masses m1 and m2 joined with springs. For this case, is necessary to 
replace the mass m1 with a reduced mass µ, which more interested readers can 
develop as an exercise.
m m µ =    1 2 (2.7) m m 1 2 +
With this relation, then equation 2.2 can be rewritten as follows:
1 k
ν = (2.8) 2 π     c µ
From this equation, now we can predict theoretically the appearance of the 
absorption bands present in the IR spectrum. For these calculations, the k values 
that have been found are between 3 × 102 and 8 × 102 N/ m for most single bonds. 
However, the value of 5 × 102 N/ m can be taken as a reasonable mean value. In 
the case of double bonds, it has been found that the value of k is 1 × 103 N/m, and 
finally, for the triple bond, a value of 1.5 × 103 N/ m is reported ( Skoog, Holler, 
and Crouch 2021).
2.2.2.3 Fourier Transform ( FTIR) Spectroscopy
As we have seen in the previous subsection, IR spectroscopy provides information on 
the type of bond that molecules have. However, the IR technique has been improving 
over time in the data acquisition to indicate or find the presence of certain chemical 
bonds. On the other side, it has been developed an alternative to IR spectroscopy 
to increase the quality of the signal, this alternative is called Fourier Transform IR 
spectroscopy ( FTIR), which essentially works in the same way as IR spectroscopy, Surface Characterization Techniques 23
FIGURE 2.7 Schematic representation of Michelson’s interferometer.
notwithstanding, the main modification is the optical arrangement that FTIR systems 
possess ( Brian C. Smith 2011).
The optical arrangement is known as the Michelson interferometer, which, as is 
seen in Figure 3.7, this optical arrangement consists of a source of IR radiation, this 
generated signal goes to a collimating mirror where it directs the signal towards a 
divider, where the signal is split into two beams, one that goes to a fixed mirror and 
another part of the signal goes towards a moving mirror, the purpose of this moving 
mirror is that the signal that comes from the source has a different optical path than 
the signal that goes to the fixed mirror.
2.2.3 r aMan speCtrosCopy
Raman spectroscopy turns out to be a complementary characterization to IR or FTIR. 
Raman also allows us to visualize the type of chemical bond that a molecule will 
present, through the vibration of the elements of which the molecule is composed. 
However, the subtle difference it has with IR spectroscopy is the type of interaction 
between the radiation ( in this case it is a monochromatic light source) and matter. As 
we will see in this section, the Raman system will measure the type of dispersion that 
the molecule has when it interacts with specific radiation.
Based on the dispersion phenomenon, two types of dispersion can be studied: 
elastic and inelastic dispersions. The elastic dispersion case was a phenomenon stud￾ied by the British physicist John W. Strutt, also known as Lord Rayleigh, when he 
tried to describe the phenomenon of light polarization ( Young 1981). Additionally, 
to these studies, he also contributed to the understanding of the process of light scat￾tering in the atmosphere which is related to the bluish color in the sky. This process, 
as its name suggests, indicates that the radiation that interacts with the matter does 
not undergo any modification after the interaction, in other words, the radiation that 
enters the molecule is equal to the radiation after the interaction (T yndall 1869). In 24 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
FIGURE 2.8 Schematic representation of (a ) Rayleigh scattering process or elastic disper￾sion and (b ) inelastic dispersion.
Raman, this process is known as Rayleigh- type scattering; see Figure 2.8a. On the 
other hand, when the dispersion type is inelastic, a significant change can be per￾ceived in the input and output signals, and in this case, the output signal will be dif￾ferent from the input signal. This difference can be visualized as a red shift or a blue 
shift, radiation gain or loss, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.8b. The Raman effect 
is an inelastic light- scattering phenomenon in which two different types of processes 
can occur, the first and most common process is that the photon can lose energy dur￾ing the interaction with the molecule ( Stokes). The second process could be that the 
photon can gain energy after the interaction with the molecule (A nti-S tokes). These 
two processes will be discussed below in this section. The interaction can happen by 
distortion or polarization of the electron cloud that surrounds the nucleus to create a 
short lifetime that is called a virtual state. To generate this virtual state, it is neces￾sary to use a high- intensity monochromatic beam, such as a laser ( Vandenabeele 
2013). The generated virtual state is not stable, so if a photon is excited to the virtual 
state, it tends to recombine rapidly. Become obvious that the energy of these states 
also depends on the excitation wavelength source. So, at room temperature, most 
molecules are at the lowest energy level (S koog, Holler, and Crouch 2021). Among 
these, the most likely process that could occur is the Rayleigh scattering, where most 
of the photons that are scattered do not present a change in energy and therefore the 
incident photons on the material return to the same energy state, that is, when most Surface Characterization Techniques 25
FIGURE 2.9 Raman scattering process, Rayleigh, Stokes, and a nti- Stokes types.
photons return to their ground state, radiation with the same wavelength as the inci￾dent radiation is emitted. Therefore, changing the photon energy becomes a direct 
measure of the phonon energy.
 Stokes- type scattering occurs when the energy of the reemitted photon is lesser 
than the incident photon, and that is why in Figure 2.9, the energy relationship is 
represented as a subtraction between the natural oscillation frequency ν0 and the 
emission frequency, ν1. This indicates a loss of energy of the photon. The process 
in which the energy of the reemitted photon has higher energy than the energy of 
the incident photon is called anti- S tokes- type scattering, here the energy difference 
is represented as a sum of frequencies between ν0 and ν1, and now here the photon 
increase his energy.
As is typical in Raman spectroscopy, it is necessary to indicate the differences 
between the intensities of these three types of interaction (S mith and Dent 2019). It is 
well known that the relative intensities will depend on the temperature and the occu￾pation of the different states of the system. For the case of Stokes and anti- Stokes 
scattering, we should emphasize that anti- S tokes scattering compared to Stokes scat￾tering has a much lower probability of occurring because there are few energy tran￾sitions where there is an energy gain. In addition, for Rayleigh scattering there is 
no change; as was mentioned this scattering is elastic, so there is no Raman shift. 
However, in the anti- Stokes case, the shift is toward minor wavelengths. Finally, it is 
important to highlight that the intensities corresponding to the Rayleigh and Stokes 
processes are much higher than the intensities that the anti-S tokes scattering pres￾ents, as previously mentioned.
As a context of this characterization technique, it has its beginnings in the 1920s, 
when the physicist Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman published a series of investiga￾tions on molecular diffraction, but it was not until 1928 that he published the results 
of this effect (R aman effect) ( Gardiner and Graves 1989). And, in addition to the 
vibrational information that the molecule has, this technique has also been used to 26 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
obtain crystallinity information, detect doping and/ or matrix defects, and distinguish 
from heat treatments.
2.2.4 x- ray photoeleCtron speCtrosCopy
Surfaces are very important since many properties of a material depend on the inter￾actions between its surface and the surrounding environment. Among the techniques 
of analysis of surfaces, XPS has demonstrated their capability to provide value infor￾mation of a surface related to the quantitative and qualitative chemical bonding, ele￾mental composition, oxidation states, and so on. In this section, we will discuss the 
powerful of XPS through several examples.
The origins of XPS can be traced to the photoelectric effect noticed by Hertz and 
later described by Einstein in 1905. During the photoelectric process, when photons 
of specific energies given by hv impact with a material, the energy of the light is 
transferred to the atoms of the material. If the work function of the material is lower 
than the energy of the photons, then electrons with certain kinetic energy, Ek, will 
be ejected from the surface. The equation that relates the energies of photons and 
electrons is ( Heide 2012)
BE = − h E ν φ k s − pectrometer (2.9)
where BE is the binding energy of the electron, while ϕspectrometer is the work func￾tion of the spectrometer. An XPS spectrum is plotted as a function of the number 
of electrons detected per unit time versus BE. Since each element produces a unique 
set of XPS peaks at characteristic BE values, it allows the direct identification of the 
elements existing on the surface of the material being analyzed.
2.2.4.1 XPS Acquisition Modes and Some Examples
There are several acquisition modes for XPS, for instance, conventional mode. The 
XPS spectra allow identification of elemental composition of a surface. Detection 
limit for the atomic concentration is close to 0.05 at.%. Likewise, oxidation states 
of the elements can be studied. When an XPS measurement is performed, several 
analyses can be done to obtain the survey, high- resolution or valence band spectra, 
and the Auger peaks, among others.
In Figure 2.10, a survey spectrum of a Fe3O4 powder sample is shown, as seen 
there are several peaks at different binding energies. However, some of the most 
important are labeled according to the chemical composition of the sample ( Fe 2p, 
O 1s, and C 1s). Iron and oxygen combine to form Fe oxides, in this case, Fe3O4. The 
presence of carbon is attributed to the interaction between the sample and air from 
the environment ( Watts and Wolstenholme 2019). Despite the evident contamination 
of the surface of the sample, the C 1s peak is useful to calibrate the XPS signals since 
C 1s is assigned to adventitious hydrocarbon placed between 284.6 and 285.0 eV, 
which is important for interpretations of good results and will be discussed later 
( Moulder et al. 1992). Survey spectra measurements are useful in order to study the 
presence of chemical elements on the first surface layers ( less than 12 nm). However, 
conventional XPS equipment performs this measurement with a step energy of 1 eV. Surface Characterization Techniques 27
FIGURE 2.10 Survey of a Fe3O4 sample.
If some elements are of interest, there is another analysis mode that is able to measure 
step energies lower than 1 eV. It is known as high- resolution ( HR- X PS) or c ore- level 
mode. H R-X PS is useful to investigate in more detail the bonds between elements 
and the surface chemical composition of a sample.
In F igure 2.11, the c ore- level spectra of ( a) Fe 2p, (b ) Co 2p, and ( c) Ni 2p states 
are shown. As seen, 2p states are presented as a doublet, that is, two peaks appear. It 
should be mentioned that these doublets are formed since spin– orbit splitting arises 
from quantum mechanical considerations. The 2J+ 1 degeneracy should be con￾sidered, where J is the total angular momentum quantum operator, which satisfies 
J=L+S, being L the orbital- and S the spin-q uantum angular momentum operators 
(Morales-Luna et al. 2019).
As known, the associated quantum numbers ( principal n, orbital l, and spin s) are 
constrained since l is an integer number (0 , 1, 2, …), for electrons s=½, and allowed 
values of j are l s − ≤ j l ≤ + s . Then, for 2p states such as Fe 2p, Ni 2p, and Co 2p, 
the peaks are labeled as Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, and Co 2p3/2 and 
Co 2p1/2, respectively. From the inspection of the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 contributions of each 
element it is noted that the 2p3/2 contributions have higher area (o r intensity) than the 
2p1/2 photoelectron lines, this fact is explained since the areas ( or intensities) of the 
peaks are connected by the 2J+ 1 degeneracies as follows Area (M 2p1/2)/Area (M
2p3/2) =[2(1/2)+1]/ [2(3/2)+ 1] =1/2, where M is the element analyzed. The same 
relation can be used for the peak intensities for most of the elements. However, it has 
been reported that some elements, such as Ti 2p peaks (a s seen in F igure 2.12), do not 
satisfy that equation for intensities since the intensity of the Ti 2p1/2 peak is not the 
half of that displayed by the Ti 2p3/2 peak due to the Coster– Kronig effect. Moreover, 
while Ti 2p1/2 does not reach the expected intensity, its F ull- Wide at H alf- Maximum 28 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

( FWHM) is higher than expected, which should be similar to that exhibited by the Ti 
2p3/2 peak ( Chambers et al. 2018).
Returning to the peak area ratios of an XPS doublet, Area ( peak 1)/ Area ( peak 2), 
that relation can be extended to other states. For instance, for 3d states, the s pin– o rbit 
values are given by 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, while for 4f states, the peaks are labeled 4f7/2 and 
4f5/2. In Table 2.1, the peak area ratios are shown for different subshells reported in 
the literature ( G ranada- R amírez et al. 2022; Eguía- E guía et al. 2021; Kloprogge and 
Wood 2020; Pérez et al. 2021).
With respect to the calibration of XPS signals, the most common method consists 
of using the C 1s peak attributed to adventitious hydrocarbon. This method is as 
follows: first, determine the position of the C 1s signal, and then shift at higher ( or 
lower) binding energy until the C 1s peak matches the position of 284.6 eV. However, 
several references use other positions: for instance, 284.8 or even 285 eV ( Moulder 
et al. 1992). Finally, shift the peaks of other elements in the same amount that is used 
for C 1s. The process is shown in Figure 2.13, where the C 1s peak was shifted an 
amount of ΔE ( F igure 2.13a), and then the peaks that correspond to Pt 4f and Fe 2p 
were shifted in the same energy ΔE, as shown in Figure 2.13b and c.
It should be noticed in Figure 2.13 that the signal height is higher at higher ener￾gies ( left side of the curves). That effect in the spectra arises due to several factors 
being the inelastic scattering of electrons as the main source ( Heide 2012; Watts and 
Wolstenholme 2019).

For quantification of the elemental composition of a sample, background signal 
must be removed. It has been pointed out that the background subtraction process is 
an open line of research since traditional methods do not give an exact amount of 
each element in a sample. However, at least three background subtraction routines are 
widely used: Linear, Shirley, and Tougaard ( Heide 2012; Watts and Wolstenholme 
2019). As seen in Figure 2.14, the background of Fe 2p peak has been adjusted using 
the Linear, Shirley, Tougaard, and “S hirley- type” or Smart routines. In general, for 
peaks with a behavior similar to that exhibited by the Fe 2p doublet, the linear back￾ground is not recommended to use since it does not discriminate between the XPS 
and the background signals.
It has been reported that peak areas (a nd consequently, the estimation of the ele￾mental composition) varied as much as 50% if the integration points are slightly 
moved ( Watts and Wolstenholme 2019). The Tougaard background has a theoreti￾cal basis that considers the scattering of electrons in solids. However, at the same 
time, several parameters must be adjusted to perform the analysis, thus limiting its 
practical application. The Shirley routine has no theoretical basis, but considering 
an S-s haped background has been demonstrated to be very effective to quantify the 
elemental composition of most of the samples with acceptable accuracy. On the other 
hand, the Smart background implemented in the Avantage software ( Thermo Fisher Surface Characterization Techniques 31
Scientific) is an “ improved” Shirley routine with the constraint that the background 
is always below the experimental data. For the Fe 2p doublet presented in Figure 2.4, 
the peak area was estimated and presented in Table 2.2, considering the same region 
but different subtraction routines, as the Shirley and Smart backgrounds provide 
almost the same areas, while Linear and Tougaard backgrounds give completely dif￾ferent values.
Some elements display only one peak in appearance, for instance, the Se 3d sig￾nal. However, if a deconvolution process is carried out, the peak may be resolved in 
two components as shown in F igure 2.15, since two peaks are expected because of 
the spin– o rbit splitting. When the principal and orbital ( n and l) quantum numbers

are fixed, the separation of the components is higher for higher atomic number of the 
atom ( Watts and Wolstenholme 2019).
A very useful variant in XPS for thin- film analysis is the depth profile mode. By 
etching the surface of the material using an Ar+ ion gun, the elemental composition 
of a sample as a function of the etching time is registered. However, this is a destruc￾tive method since the ion/c luster bombardment can change the initial oxidation state 
of chemical elements in the studied surface. This can be observed in Figure 2.16: a 
cupper thin film was etched for 40 seconds, and measurement was performed each 
10 seconds, obtaining a spectrum that provides information of the state of the sample 
at that time. It should be mentioned that the ion bombardment can change the origi￾nal oxidation states of a sample. Then, it is recommended to analyze the sample as 
received without any cleaning process or ion etching. In summary, the XPS analy￾sis can provide much information of the surface of a sample and even from deeper 
regions through a depth profile analysis.
2.2.5 preparation of saMples for CheMiCal CharaCterizations
Raman and IR spectroscopies do not require a special preparation of the samples. 
These techniques usually are performed at room temperature and are not destructive.
For XPS measurements, the preparation of samples in thin-fi lm form is quite sim￾ple, since no cleaning process is recommended because any change of the surface 
will affect the analysis. For that reason, samples are mounted on the sample holder 
as received and then introduced to the load lock to degas the film before analysis. For Surface Characterization Techniques 33

mounting the sample on the holder, the laboratory technician usually uses gloves, 
face mask, and tweezers to avoid surface contamination of thin films. However, 
when samples are in powder form, there are several ways to mount the sample. For 
instance, a double-s ide carbon tape is set on the holder, and then a small amount of 
powder is deposited and then pressed on the carbon tape using a clean aluminum foil. 
Another option is to dissolve the powder in water or alcohol, depending on the char￾acteristics of the sample, and then some drops of liquid are deposited on a “ substrate” 
(e .g., clean glass, quartz, or aluminum). When the liquid has been evaporated, the 
substrate with the powder sample impregnated can be introduced inside the XPS load 
lock chamber, and subsequently to the analysis chamber for measurement.
2.3 MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION
2.3.1 d efinition of MorphologiCal CharaCterization
The morphological characterizations allow obtaining the shape, topography and 
grain size of the surfaces by different microscopies, which have evolved in time. In 
1993, the scientists Ruska and Knoll built the first scanning electron microscopy 
( SEM), called transmission electron microscopic (T EM) (E rni 2015), in which the 
emitted electron passes through very thin layers. In 1938, Von Ardenne incorpo￾rated a scanning coil to the TEM using 23 kV voltage, improving image resolution 
from 50 to 100 nm, and magnifying the image by 8,000 times its size (v on Ardenne 
1938). In 1942, Zworykin, Hillier, and Snyder presented an SEM using secondary 
electron uptake to obtain the image contrast ( Schmitt 2014). In 1952, Oatley devel￾oped an electrostatic lens with a voltage of 40 kV for the electron source (O atley, 34 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
Nixon, and Pease 1966). The SEM images are generated by the emission of elec￾trons, and these images are generated in a scale of grays and coat the areas from 
surfaces. These surfaces range from nanometer to micrometer scale. The images 
can be enlarged from 300,000 to 1,000,000 of its size without losing definition. 
Another important technique is energy dispersion spectroscopy ( EDS), which 
works together with an SEM to supply information either qualitative or quantita￾tive from the material that is under study, such as the composition of elements. The 
equipment consists of a system that contains a chamber at a certain pressure, in 
which samples with a size of up to 200 mm2 and height of 80 mm can be analyzed. 
Samples require minimal preparation for SEM characterization, and measure￾ments can be performed for small samples as long as they fit in the vacuum cham￾ber without altering their physical state. Samples should be mounted on a holder 
and coated with a thin film of heavy metal elements to permit spatial dispersion 
of electrical charges on the sample surface. This allows a better image production 
with higher definition.
2.3.2 sCanning probe MiCrosCopy
One of the important features of SPM is that any type of interaction between the tip 
and the sample can be measured accordingly to the interaction measured with the 
 tip- sample distance. During a typical SPM measurement, the tip performs a sweep 
over the surface of samples creating and resolving images related to the surface vari￾ations as a function of position. Generally, images are represented in the micrograph 
like color contrasts. This type of microscopy has its beginnings in 1998 ( Binnig et al. 
1998), with the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope, which is an instru￾ment for obtaining images of surfaces at the atomic level. The first successful experi￾ment with a tunneling microscope was carried out by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich 
Rohrer ( Binnig et al. 1998; Binnig et al. 1983).
2.3.3 sCanning tunneling MiCrosCopy
As previously described, this microscopy was developed by Binnig and Roher at the 
IBM laboratories ( Switzerland) for this contribution they received the Nobel Prize in 
Physics in 1986 ( Binnig and Rohrer 1987). This type of microscope generates surface 
images under a very important principle in quantum mechanics, which is the tunnel 
effect. To describe this phenomenon, we should consider a scenario where ideal sur￾faces of a metal and a semiconductor are separated by vacuum or any insulator ( see 
Figure 2.17). In Figure 2.17, E1 and E2 represent the energy of the electrons in each 
surface, Eb1 and Eb2 depict the energy barrier in the position where the insulator is in 
contact with the metals, and d is the thickness of the insulator.
In the classical regime, the electrons of the metallic material cannot be transferred 
from one surface to another due to the presence of the insulator due to the presence 
of the energy barrier and which the electrons cannot cross. However, an alternative 
to promote the migration of electrons is the application of a voltage between the two 
plates, with value V = E1 − E2. This produces a modification in the barrier making the 
electrons show the best mobility to cross that energy barrier. So, if these electrons Surface Characterization Techniques 35
FIGURE 2.17 Schematic representation of the energy profile between two metal plates sep￾arated by an insulator: ( a) without applying the potential and ( b) an instant after the potential 
application. The red dotted line indicates the direction of propagation of electrons, and this is 
the phenomenon of tunneling.
have enough energy to move through the barrier, this effect is usually known as the 
tunneling effect (H awkes and Spence 2019).
The tunneling effect for STM could be defined as the electron that is on the sur￾face of the material after applying the voltage presents a non- zero probability of 
escape from the surface. Therefore, if the tip moves closer to a metallic material just 
before contact, the electrons from the tip will have a non- zero probability of jumping 
from the tip to the sample through the vacuum ( Kochanski 1989).
As described above, in this characterization a sharp and conductive tip is used, 
and voltage is applied between the tip and the sample. This voltage modifies the 
energy of the electrons that are near the surface of the tip and the surface of the 
sample. So, these electrons can jump from the tip to the sample making the tunneling 
( tunneling current). In other words, to generate a surface image of some samples it is 
necessary to measure the change in the tunneling current. This current can increase 
if the tip and the sample are remarkably close but this current decreases exponen￾tially as the tip and the sample separate.
In STM, there are usually two types of measurement (L eng 2009): constant volt￾age mode, in which the position of the tip is kept unchanged during the scanning of 
the sample surface. The second is the constant current mode, in which the distance 
between the tip and the sample surface is kept in constant adjustment.36 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
2.3.4 sCanning eleCtron MiCrosCopy ( seM)
SEM has a source of primary electrons that reaches the surface of the sample, thus 
releasing small amounts of electrons known as secondary electrons, which were in 
the orbits of their atoms and were expelled from it. The electrons emitted from the 
surface called backscattered electrons, are originally primary electrons, when they 
penetrate the surface are deviated from their initial trajectory, these electrons don’t 
lose neither speed nor energy, this deviation is denominated as elastic scattering, 
if the deviation is greater than 90°, the electron will leave the sample, these elec￾trons generate contrast in the images, which means that we have areas with different 
chemical compositions, the elements that are heavier or have a high atomic number 
will appear brighter.
With the help of the condenser, objective lens, and scan coils, sample focus can be 
achieved by the electron beam. A scintillation detector is used to collect both second￾ary and backscattered electrons, with a positive voltage on the detector screen, both 
electrons will be collected ( Worsfold et al. 2019). The diagram of SEM function can 
be observed in Figure 2.18.
There exist three types of SEM, conventional SEM, ambient SEM, and low vac￾uum SEM ( Khursheed 2010; Clubb et al. 2004; Daniatos 1981). In a conventional 
SEM, the electron beam interaction with surface occurs in a vacuum of 10−6 Torr. 
However, in ambient SEM, this interaction occurs from 0.2 to 20 Torr. And the third 
SEM is the low vacuum, which is similar to a conventional SEM but adapted to oper￾ate under pressures from 0.2 to 2 Torr.

(T albot and White 2013).
The acceleration voltage used in the electron source is proportional to the quality 
of the image. When the acceleration voltage is less than 5 kV, the image is not clear. 
However, between 15 and 30 kV, it causes the electrons to penetrate under the sur￾face, and the generated image gets a higher quality. Figure 2. 19a– c shows different 
cell wall outlines with respect to change in SEM accelerating voltage.
2.3.5 energy dispersive x- ray speCtrosCopy ( eds)
The spectroscopy of energy dispersive X - ray is an analytical technique that allows 
the chemical characterization of materials. This is done through an emitter of elec￾trons that are directed to the material of study, and these electrons interact with the 
electrons of the internal orbits of the atoms that form the material, expelling them 
from it.
The expelled electrons are called secondary electrons and are fundamental in 
the SEM and the one that expelled it is called primary electron. However, sec￾ondary electrons leave behind empty energy states in the internal orbits of their 
atoms, causing those electrons from the outermost orbits of the atom, jump to 
occupy those internal energy states. This rearrangement of electrons, occupying 
energy states of internal orbits, causes photons to be emitted, and this is the basis 
of X-r ay energy dispersion spectrometry. The effect described above is illustrated 
in Figure 2.20.38 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
The emission spectrum produced by the transitions of electrons between the orbits 
of the atoms will give the atomic weight of the analyzed material or element based 
on the energy difference between the Ephoton orbitals, by using the Rydberg formula:
E
Z = photon (2.10)  1 1  R n n 2 2 −   internal external 
where Z is the atomic number of the element under study, Ephoton is the photon energy, 
R is the Rydberg constant, R= 1.097 × 107 m−1, ninternal refers to internal orbits, and 
nexternal refers to external orbits. Therefore, the location of energy peaks tells us of 
what elements the sample is made, and the magnitude of these peaks will tell us the 
amount of these elements in the sample.
Most of the EDS systems are interfaced with SEM ( Girão, Caputo, and Ferro 
2017), where they use the same electron beam source to excite X- rays from the sam￾ple under study and the detector used for obtaining the information about X- rays is 
a Si or Li detector. An X - ray emitted by the sample produces a photoelectron at the 
detector. The photoelectron in turn dissociates to form electron– hole pair, and the 
pairs give the information such as amplitude of the generated voltage pulse which is 
proportional to the incident photon energy. All the received information is processed 
within a range of voltages ( energies) and is finally transferred to a graph, like the one 
shown in Figure 2.21.
2.4 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERIZATIONS
2.4.1 definition of eleCtriCal CharaCterizations
The physical properties that change when a material is subjected to an electric field 
are referred to as electrical properties ( Araujo et al. 2020; von Ardenne 1938). Many 
metals are good conductors of electricity, and some ferromagnetic metals may also

the atom.Surface Characterization Techniques 39
FIGURE 2.21 Schematic representation of EDS.
exhibit electrical properties, although with low electrical conductivity. It should be 
noted that magnetic and electrical properties are not identical and are not always 
related.
Due to this, magnetic materials are suitable for electrical appliances and micro 
electromechanical system (M EMS), etc. ( Aslam et al. 2021). Some of the electrical 
properties are dielectric strength, surface resistance, resistivity, electrical conduc￾tivity, temperature coefficient of resistance, mobility, band gap, carrier concentra￾tion, carrier lifetime, capacitance with respect to voltage, impedance, among others 
(B atoo et al. 2013; Bertolucci et al. 2015; Binnig et al. 1983).
Magnetic nanoparticles are made of different elements possessing magnetic prop￾erties such as iron, nickel, gadolinium, to mention some of them and their chemical 
compounds. In general ferrite nanoparticles are the basic and most explored magnetic 
nanoparticles for different applications (B innig et al. 1983; Binnig et al. 1987). In this 
section, electrical characterization techniques will be discussed by referring ferrite 
nanoparticles. The performance of magnetic nanoparticles also relies on different 
electrical parameters like mobility, resistivity, carrier density, etc. Most common 
techniques to measure previously mentioned electrical properties are Hall effect, IV 
measurements, and surface resistance measurements ( Smith 2011).
2.4.2 hall effeCt
This measurement consists of the application of magnetic field to a current carry￾ing conductor in order to determine different electrical parameters. This method 
is used to differentiate between electrons and holes which are the charge carriers 
and provides information about the density of electrons or holes depending on the 
semiconductor.
Hall effect is the phenomenon where the voltage generates in a sample or sur￾face when a magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to a current carrying conduc￾tor. The generated voltage is called “H all voltage (VH)” (C hien and Westgate 2013). 40 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
Therefore, if we consider a t hin- film- type conductor in the electric field E, then it 
produces a current I and causes a force of a magnitude eE to act on the charge car￾riers. Subsequently, in the presence of magnetic field, the magnetic force is propor￾tional to the magnetic field strength (Bz
), and charge (e) and velocity (Vx) act on the 
charge carriers. If the magnetic force is at right angle to the direction of Bz and Vx, 
each charge is moved toward each side of the conductor resulting in the formation of 
an electrical charge on the surface of the thin- film conductor as the charge carriers 
reach its surface. This further gives rise to a transverse field called Hall field (EH). 
This phenomenon can be seen in Figure 2.22.
Therefore, equations ( 2.11) and ( 2.12) represent the Hall field and Hall coefficient 
(RH), respectively, at equilibrium ( Karplus and Luttinger 1954).
EH x = V B* z (2.11)
R E H H = / * ( ) J B x z (2.12)
where Jx is the current density of the specimen utilized in the experiment and is 
determined by equation ( 2.13).
J n x x = ( ) * / e V( ) (2.13)
 Figure 2.23 shows a typical experimental setup for obtaining Hall constant (RH) and 
Hall voltage (VH). The Hall constant or coefficient is found by measuring Hall volt￾age VH, which generates the Hall field EH ( CHein and Westgate 2013; Karplus and 
Luttinger 1954). If VH is taken across the thickness “t” of the specimen, then
VH H = = ( ) E t * * ( ) R J H x * * B t z (2.14)
Where J I x x = / * ( ) b t and b= width of the specimen, as shown in F igure  2.23. 
Therefore,
FIGURE 2.22 Hall field generation phenomena.Surface Characterization Techniques 41
FIGURE 2.23 Experimental setup for obtaining Hall constant.
R V H H = ( ) * / b I( ) x z * B (2.15)
The additional parameters that can be obtained by Hall measurement techniques 
are mobility, electrical conductivity electrons concentration, and holes concen￾tration from equations ( 2.16), ( 2.17), (2 .18), and ( 2.19), respectively. This means 
that Hall coefficient is negative for n - type semiconductor and positive for p -t ype 
semiconductor.
 Mobility ( ) µ R = = ( * H x J E ) / x H ( ) σ*R (2.16)
Electrical conductivity ( ) σ = J E x x /   (2.17)
Electron concentration =−1 / (e * RH ) (2.18)
Holes concentration = 1 / (e * RH ) (2.19)
Specifically, Hall constant is always negative for n- type semiconductors and is posi￾tive for p-t ype semiconductors due to the type of mobility charge carriers. It has 
been reported by different authors (D awn et al. 2022; Lan et al. 2022; Dawn et al. 
2021) that the utilization of experimental setup as shown in Figure 2.2 obtains dif￾ferent electrical properties of magnetic nanoparticles, especially for ferrites and their 
composites.
2.4.3 surfaCe resistanCe
One of the most important electrical parameters that affect directly in practical appli￾cations of the magnetic nanoparticles, or any planar materials is surface resistance. 
For example, gas sensors for detecting reducing gases like carbon monoxide and 
propane utilizes samples with higher surface resistance because of easy adsorption 
and desorption process. Whereas materials with lower surface resistance makes the 
material to be photo active in UV-v isible range, making them transparent conduc￾tive oxides. Therefore, surface resistance plays key role in many practical applica￾tions and is dependent on the operation temperature. In general, as the temperature 
increases the surface resistance of the material decreases due to the movement of 
charge carriers after gaining the thermal energy. The measurement techniques for 42 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
FIGURE 2.24 Configuration for measuring surface resistance of a planar material.
obtaining surface resistance vary slightly at room temperature and at higher tem￾peratures. In general, in research laboratories the surface resistivity is measured by 
 two- probe methods and for industrial device level measurements f our- probe method 
is preferred.
Also, it is important to distinguish the surface resistance (Rs) from the surface 
resistivity (ρ s). The surface resistance (Rs) is a measure between two points on the 
surface with electrodes, obtained in ohms (Ω) and is the ratio of voltage applied to 
the current flowing between those two measuring points, as shown in Figure 2.24. 
However, the ρs is dependent on the dimensions of the material like length and width, 
which is measured in (Ω/). Therefore, ρs is defined as the ratio of DC voltage drop 
per unit length (L) to the surface current (Is) per unit width (D). Unlike surface resis￾tance, the surface resistivity does not depend on the electrode configuration, but it 
depends on the operation temperature, which activates the material to conduct ( Loss, 
Salvado, and Pinho 2014).
The surface conduction in magnetic nanoparticles, especially ferrites, is majorly 
due to the interchange between the electron and hole. Charge carriers rise due to 
different oxidation states of the ferrites at the surface ( Shinde 2021). It is a com￾mon mechanism that the surface resistivity occurs due to the exchange of electrons 
in ferrites generally between Fe+2 and Fe+3. However, the electrical and magnetic 
properties of ferrite are strongly dependent upon the particle or grain size and grain 
boundaries. It has been reported that the increase in density of grain boundaries in 
ferrite system also increases the resistivity (P anda et al. 2016). The resistivity of 
the magnetic nanomaterials is calculated by the Arrhenius relation as mentioned in 
equation (2.20):
 Ea   
ρ ρ = oe k TB  (2.20)Surface Characterization Techniques 43
FIGURE 2.25 Experimental setup for obtaining IV characteristics.
where ρ is the resistivity, ρo is the exponential constant, Ea is the activation energy, 
kB the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin ( Shinde 2021; Panda 
et al. 2016; Loss, Salvado, and Pinho 2014; Panda, Muduli, and Behera 2015).
2.4.4 i – v MeasureMents
Utilizing c urrent– voltage (I –V ) measurements, it is possible to obtain the perfor￾mance characteristics of the devices such as leakage current, switching current, 
static current, and DC resistivity. All the I –V me asurements can be obtained utiliz￾ing t wo- probe method with Keithley Multimeters. A typical static I– V measurement 
setup is shown in F igure 2.25, which includes two external resistors R1 (b etween 
0.5 and 1 MΩ) and R2 ( between 0.2 and 0.6 MΩ), a switch, a DC power supply, and 
an ammeter A. Current and voltage values are obtained in parallel by voltmeter and 
ammeter, respectively, in two switch positions ON1 and ON2. ON1 is in connection 
with the DC power supply and ON2 is in short circuit. The results obtained are fur￾ther plotted and analyzed in order to obtain the electrical parameters ( Venkatramani 
et al. 2009 ; Zakir et al. 2021; Aslam et al. 2021; Saqib et al. 2019).
By utilizing the I–V c urves, it is possible to obtain the resistivity (ρ) of the speci￾men and is calculated from equation ( 2.21):
 ρ=(R*A) / L ( 2.21)
where R is the resistance, “A = πr2” is known as the area of the specimen, and L is the 
thickness of the specimen.
Also, it is possible to confirm the behavior of the device whether ohmic or non￾o hmic by observing and interpreting the variation in the current with respect to the 
voltage applied. An ohmic behavior is observed when voltage is directly or linearly 
proportional to current, which is observed at lower voltages, that is, V < 1 V and is 
given in equation (2 .22).
V α I
α (2.22)44 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
When α= l, ohmic behavior is observed, and as α increases, a n on- ohmic behavior 
is observed. In the n on- ohmic region, voltage is exponentially proportional to cur￾rent and is observed at higher voltages, that is, V > 1 V ( Singh and Chauhan 2019; 
Venkatramani et al. 2009). It has been reported ( Devi et al. 2011; Batoo et al. 2013) 
that non- ohmic region in magnetic nanomaterials occurs due to the space charge 
effects and is termed as space c harge- limited current region, which is used to under￾stand the conduction mechanism in nanoferrites ( Singh and Chauhan 2019).
2.4.5 preparation of saMples for eleCtriCal CharaCterizations
The electrical characterization is used in almost all research centers and is an important 
part of the investigation of the physical properties of materials. The traditional way of 
measuring electrical resistivity is the four- point method, which is used for thin films 
with a rectangular shape. However, it cannot be used with irregular shapes. The Van der 
Pauw technique solves this problem and improves the reliability of the measurements. 
The technique is nondestructive, and only small amounts of metal are placed on the 
surface to be measured. The technique is more precise, and we only require knowing the 
thickness of the sample. The technique allows us to measure the electrical resistivities of 
up to 109 Ω- cm. The Van der Pauw technique requires four contacts on the surface of the 
sample to be measured ( van der Pauw 1991), as shown in Figure 2.26.
We made eight measurements combining the four contacts, that is, electrical 
current is passed from contacts 1 to 2 and the voltage between contacts 3 and 4 is 
measured, then when the direction of this electrical current is reversed, the current 
will flow from the contact 2 to 1, and also the voltage between contacts 3 and 4 is 
measured and so on. The contact points can be cleaned with acetone and then with 
methanol. Later, they will be immersed in dilute HCl, and leaving the contacts to 
drain will preserve the tips of the tips. The Van der Pauw equation assumes small 
contacts of the order of 10 microns.
The cleansing of silicon wafer is standardly done as follows ( Kern 1990):
The wafers are immersed in deionized water. If there are visible contaminants, 
a preliminary cleansing in piranha solution is required. The wafers are rinsed with 
FIGURE 2.26 Implementation of electrical resistivity measurement in semiconductor thin 
films by the Van der Pauw method.Surface Characterization Techniques 45
deionized water between each step. The containers used for cleansing are made from 
fused silica or fused quartz, and also the chemicals products utilized must be of elec￾tronic grade or CMOS grade to avoid contamination of the wafers.
 1. S C- 1 cleansing, where SC means standard cleansing, is done as follows: five 
parts of deionized water, one part of ammonia water, 29% weight of NH, 
and one part of aqueous solution of HO, 30%. Cleansing is done between 
75°C and 80°C for 10 minutes. The mixture removes organic waste. This 
treatment forms a thin layer of silicon dioxide of approximately 1 nm on the 
silicon, with a certain degree of iron contamination, this will be removed in 
subsequent steps.
 2. The second is an optional step, to remove the thin layer of dioxide and small 
ionic contaminants formed on the surface. This is done in a 1:100 or 1:50 
solution of aqueous HF at 25°C for about 15 seconds. This step is performed 
within ultra-high-purity materials and ultra-clean containers, since the sili￾con surface without surface oxide is very reactive.
 3. The third and last step called S C- 2 is carried out with a solution of the fol￾lowing proportions: six parts of deionized water, one part of aqueous HCl 
of 37% in weight, one part of aqueous solution of HO, 30%, at a cleaning 
temperature between 75°C and 80°C. The substrates were ultrasonicated in 
the above mentioned S C- 2 solution for 10 min. The process removes traces 
of ionic metal contaminants. In the end, there’s a passive thin layer sitting 
on the surface of the wafer.
 4. And finally, a rinse with water is carried out and drying is carried out with 
nitrogen.
2.5 SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES
In this work, we have described the most common surface characterization tech￾niques for magnetic nanomaterials. By the usage of these techniques, it is possible to 
obtain accurate information regarding chemical, morphological, and electrical prop￾erties. The chemical characterizations described in this work include IR, Raman, 
and XPS, which provide information regarding the chemical composition, crystal￾line structure, and chemical bonding between the atoms that built up the material. 
Furthermore, the morphological characterizations provide information related to 
the surface shape, size, aspect ratio, and topography. The discussed techniques were 
SMP, STM, and S EM- EDS. By this group of microscopies, it is possible to obtain the 
size of grains/ particles as their aspect ratio.
Finally, the Hall effect, surface resistance, and IV measurements provide infor￾mation related to changes in electrical properties like surface resistance or behavior 
of the relation current– voltage. These properties are important especially for materi￾als applications and device fabrication.
Although there are various characterization techniques, which are not possible to 
cover in this work, we have focused on the characterization techniques most used in 
the manufacture of devices in semiconductors applied to manufacture devices such 
as sensors, catalysts, and magnetic nanomaterials.46 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

3.1 INTRODUCTION
 Core– shell nanostructures are distinct from regular nanoparticles in several attri￾butes, based on the structure, functionalities, and materials used to create them. 
 Core– shell nanostructures fall under the category of hybrid nanostructures, which 
are made up of two or more constituent elements but are only joined chemically 
rather than by molecular bridges at the boundaries ( Zhang et  al. 2009). Due to 
their special qualities, which are not accessible from either the core or the shell but 
are only feasible when the c ore– shell structure occurs, these nanomaterials have 
received a lot of attention in recent days ( Kalska- Szostko, Wykowska, and Satuła 
2015). The physical characteristics of the core and the shell can be modified depend￾ing on the need for applications. A multi- shell nanostructure with a lot of shells 
surrounding a central nanoparticle is also conceivable. By altering the core– shell 
dimensions and the properties of the material of the core and shell, it is conceiv￾able to adopt the magnetic properties of core– shell nanostructures. Elements like 
iron ( Fe) and cobalt ( Co) and their chemical derivatives ( magnetite ( Fe3O4), iron 
oxides, and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3)) are recurrently cast off in magnetic c ore– shell 
nanostructures. When an external magnetic field is present, the c ore– shell aligns 
its magnetic moments with the external magnetic flux density. An extensive contact 
between the core and shell nanostructures results in an effective exchange coupling 
in such structures ( Zeng et al. 2004). This causes cooperative magnetic switching 
between the shell and the core, allowing the characteristics of core– shell nanostruc￾tures to be tuned as a result. This magnetic response draws the magnetic core– shell 
nanostructures toward the direction of the applied magnetics gradient. Due to these 
magnetic properties, the core– shell nanostructures are beneficial in fields like data 
storage, molecular and cellular separation, spintronics, magnetic resonance imag￾ing ( MRI), drug delivery system, and cancer therapy ( Tamer et al. 2010). Magnetic 
 core– shell nanostructures have received a great deal of attention recently because of 
their enhanced design and adaptability in many fields of study, including biological 
sciences. The core– shell nanostructures consist of a thin shell composed of which￾ever material is suitable for the application surrounding a highly magnetic core. 
Magnetic core– shell nanostructures have been researched for their potential use in- 
 vivo imaging, drug transport, and therapeutic hyperthermia, in addition to the many 
methods for their manufacturing. This chapter mainly focuses on the core– shell 
nanostructures, synthesis, tailoring of their properties, and applications of core– 
 shell magnetic nanostructures.
3.2 CLASSIFICATION OF CORE–SHELL NANOSTRUCTURES
Contrary to simple nanoparticles, which are often formed of a single material, core– 
 shell nanostructures are typically made of two or more components. The core– shell 
type nanostructures are generally defined as having an inner core constituent and 
an outer shell component. Figure  3.1 illustrates the different types of core– shell 
nanostructures. They are ( i) concentric spherical core– shell nanostructures ( simple 
spherical core and shell of different materials), ( ii) hexagonal core– shell nanostruc￾tures ( the core of hexagonal shape and coated with shell coatings), ( iii) solitary shell

material covered onto numerous core materials, (i v) alternative concentric metal 
shell coating onto dielectric core materials, and (v ) hollow shell material with a mov￾able core inside ( Ghosh Chaudhuri and Paria 2012). The ultimate usage and applica￾tion have a noteworthy influence on the choice of shell material for the core– shell 
nanoparticle. The two or more different materials that constitute the core of most 
of the particles can be used to characterize core– shell nanostructures. It might be 
impossible to articulate all the conceivable permutations of the large diversity of 
substances and elements found on Earth. This makes it appear more acceptable to 
divide the ingredients that make core/s hell nanostructures into organic and inorganic 
compounds. These can be constructed from a wide range of distinctive combinations 
that function well together, including organic/ organic, inorganic/ organic, inorganic/ 
inorganic, and organic/ inorganic materials.
3.2.1 o rganiCs
The organic constituents are associated with polymers, carbonaceous constituents, 
sugars, etc. to progress bio and cyto affinity, particularly for cases utilizing the human 
body ( Liu et al. 2010). For the utmost part, polymerization processes are cast off in 
organic material preparations to generate the organic core, shell, or both. The fun￾damental method of polymerization entails the addition of numerous units of proper 
monomeric substrates with vital functions to produce 3D network- like assemblies. 
Organic shells can be created in situ, even though organic cores are frequently syn￾thesized first. Surfactants, polyelectrolytes, and other surface modifiers can indeed 
be implemented to enhance the coating’s effectiveness and stability.
3.2.2 i norganiCs
The inorganic materials can be further divided into s ilica-b ased and metal-b ased 
subcategories. They encompass all metals, metallic alloys, inorganic materials, 
metal salts, etc. The wide category of “ metal- based core– shell nanostructures” 
requires further s ub- classification and can be separated into three categories: metal￾lic nanoparticles, metal oxides, and metal salts, in that order.54 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
3.2.3 CoMbinations of Core– shell nanostruCtures
3.2.3.1 Organic–Organic Core–Shell Nanoparticles
Under this category, both the shell and core of particles are made of polymers or 
other organic components. These sorts of particles, also denoted as “ smart particles,” 
have a wide variety of uses in several works, including catalysis, chemical separation, 
biosensing, drug delivery, and biomaterials. The benefits of having a polymer coating 
on yet another polymer include the ability to change the material’s physical features, 
such as durability or glass transition temperature ( Si and Yang 2011). The capacity 
to synthesize polymers with certain features, such as biocompatibility, size, struc￾ture, and functionality, has been a key factor in the creation of core/ shell materials 
made of polymers. The glass transition temperature ( Tg) of the polymer/ polymer type 
core/ shell nanostructures is taken into consideration when selecting them for a given 
application. The difference in Tg across a p olymer– polymer boundary may depend 
on the border width, the stark difference between bulk Tg values, network connectiv￾ity, and relative Debye– Waller factors. Because polymers are in what is referred to 
as a “ glassy state” below this temperature, the Tg is a crucial property of a polymer. 
The mechanical properties of the polymers shift and that of a glassy ( fragile) to a rub￾bery ( stretchy) substance when the material’s temperature crosses the glass transition 
point. While a low Tg shell material enhances film- forming capacity, a high Tg core 
particle influences enhancing mechanical firmness. Pekarek et al. ( 1996) described 
how a polymer– polymer functionalization was used to create a core/ shell polymer 
system, which included a core of one polymer and a covering of another ( shell).
3.2.3.2 Inorganic–Inorganic Core–Shell Nanostructures
The utmost substantial class of core/ shell nanostructures is composed of inorganic/ 
inorganic particles. Photonic bioimaging, bio labeling, optical devices, catalysis, 
quantum dots, and improvements in semiconductor effectiveness are mostly just a 
few applications for these kinds of particles. These types of core/ shell particles can be 
roughly divided into two groups based on the composition of the shell material: those 
that contain silica and those made of any other inorganic substance. Additionally, 
it is clear that silica, metallic, metal salts, or other inorganic compounds typically 
make up the cores and shells of the many kinds of inorganic/ inorganic nanoparticles 
( Ghosh Chaudhuri and Paria 2012). The silica covering as a core particle has several 
benefits. The following are the silica coating’s primary advantages over other inor￾ganic or organic coatings: It lowers bulk conductivity and improves the core parti￾cles’ dispersion resilience. Moreover, silica is perhaps the most unreactive substance 
that is commercially available; it can cover the inner surface without interfering with 
the ongoing redox process.
3.2.3.3 Inorganic–Organic Core–Shell Nanostructures
Inorganic compounds, a metallurgical mixture, metallic salts, silica, polymers, or 
indeed any densely packed organic material form up the core of i norganic– organic 
nanostructured materials with an organic shell ( Chiozzi and Rossi 2020). The organic 
layer over the inorganic material has numerous benefits. One of the main features of 
the organic layer is the metal core’s increased oxidation stability that prevents the 
 Core–Shell Magnetic Nanostructures 55
metal core’s surface atoms from oxidizing to metal oxide in a typical environment. 
They also have improved bioactivity for use in biological applications. The particles 
have often been encapsulated in a suspension medium for a variety of applications, 
and the attractive and repulsive forces between both the particles play a major role 
in the durability of the resulting colloidal dispersion. S hort- range isotropic attrac￾tions, Van der Waals’ forces, steric repulsion, and electrostatic repulsion are the four 
types of interacting forces. The electrostatic and steric repulsion forces can be man￾aged by relying on the synthesizing medium, which prevents the nanoparticles from 
aggregating. Based on their material properties, the core particles can be roughly 
separated into two classes: magnetic-organic and nonmagnetic-organic core–shell 
nanostructures.
3.2.3.4 Organic–Inorganic Core–Shell Nanostructures
Since organic–inorganic core–shell nanostructures combine exceptional qualities 
that none of the separate components possessed, hybrid materials made of organic 
and inorganic key components are attracting more and more attention. A metal oxide 
covering on organic material, in particular, is advantageous because it increases the 
material’s overall effectiveness, barrier properties, thermal and colloidal stability, 
and damage tolerance ( Chen et al. 2010). These particles can also increase the fragil￾ity of inorganic particles while simultaneously exhibiting polymeric features such as 
outstanding optical qualities, flexibility, and durability. These nanostructures have 
recently generated a lot of consideration due to their wide range of applications in a 
variety of material science domains, such as paints, ferrofluids, catalysis, microelec￾tronics, and bioengineering. The core of this particular class of core– shell nanostruc￾tures is mainly made up of polymers ( polystyrene, polyethylene oxide, polyurethane, 
polyvinyl benzyl chloride, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, dextrose, surfactant) and different 
copolymers ( acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, poly styrene- acrylic acid, and styrene 
methyl methacrylate). Additionally, a variety of substances, including metallic mate￾rials, inorganic materials, metal chalcogenides, and silica, can be used to create the 
shell.
3.2.4 general MeChanisM for the synthesis of
 Core– shell nanostruCtures
The general mechanism for the synthesis of c ore– shell nanostructures was put forth 
by Cozzoli et al. ( Carbone and Cozzoli 2010; Casavola et al. 2008). They described the 
technicalities of general mechanisms for the synthesis of core– shell nanostructures as 
follows: Typically, two- stage mechanisms are used to form core– shell nanostructures, 
with the first step including the production and purification of the core nanostruc￾ture and the second step including the growth of the shell. The first step includes 
directly nucleating and growing the shell material onto already- formed nanocrystal 
cores. The most popular technique for this method is known be SILAR ( successive 
ionic layer adsorption and reaction) approach, which includes the inclusion of diluted 
solutions containing shell precursors or alternating infusions of cation and anion. The 
further process includes the formation of a crystalline shell through annealing of an 
amorphous or discontinuous shell during its deposition, and the seeds are primed for 
 56 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
growth, which is followed by polymerization. Subsequently through a redox reaction, 
sacrificed shell material replaces the core’s outer layer. The preceding process results 
in the Kirkendall effect, which arises when two different materials are positioned 
near one another and diffusion is permitted between them. This effect results in the 
formation of hollow shell nanostructures. The restraints on the growth and formation 
of the nuclei, phase separation accompanying annealing, diffusion, and flocculation of 
 solid- state reactions end in the formation of core– shell nanostructures.
3.3 SYNTHESIS OF MAGNETIC CORE–SHELL 
NANOSTRUCTURES
The fabrication of magnetic nanomaterials and their subsequent coating with suitable 
organic or inorganic components, depending on the application, are the two primary 
phases in the production of magnetic c ore– shell nanostructures. The usability and 
ultimate utilization of core– shell nanostructures heavily influence the choice of shell 
materials. Figure 3.2 shows an innovative method for fabricating various core– shell 
nanoparticles made of carbon and magnetite. It involves the thermal decarboxylation 
of iron acetyl sulfonyl acetate and the solvothermal reaction of glucose in nonaqueous 
solutions ( Shen et al. 2013). As protective coatings, silica, other kinds of metallic and 
nonmetal oxides, polymeric materials, and bioactive compounds are frequently used. 
Thus, the development of magnetic nanoparticles is the most critical problem herein 
( core). The following four techniques can be used to create core– shell nanostructures.
3.3.1 MiCroeMulsion Method
The thermodynamically constant isotropic solution, at which the m icro- domain of 
any of that or even both liquids is stabilized by an interfacial surfactant coating, is a 
 so- called microemulsion. Microdroplets of the aqueous phase, bound by a monolayer 
of surfactant molecules in the continuous hydrocarbon phase, are disseminated in 
 water- in- oil microemulsions. The size of the reverse micelle was determined by the 
molar ratio of water to surfactant. When two identical water- in- oil microemulsions 
with the preferred reactants are combined, the outcome is a continual collision and 
break, followed by a subsequent break, which eventually forms a precipitate in the 
micelles. When a solvent, such as acetone or ethanol, is added to the microemulsions, 
a precipitate is created that can be removed by filtration or centrifugation. A micro￾emulsion was used in this concept as a nanoreactor to create nanoparticles. Vogt et al. 
( 2010) described how monodispersed, solitary magnetite core– SiO2 shell nanopar￾ticles with variable shell thickness around 5– 13 nm using a painstakingly perfected 
inverse microemulsion technique. The synthesized superparamagnetic core of iron 
oxide nanoparticles with SiO2 shell showed a superparamagnetic nature with a high 
enough magnetization, making them suitable for biomedical applications.
3.3.2 therMal deCoMposition Method
The notion of high- quality semiconductor nanocrystalline fabrication and o xide- 
 nanoparticle production utilizing thermal decomposition technology in a nonaqueous 
 Core–Shell Magnetic Nanostructures 57

medium led to the formation of magnetic particles having appropriate form and size 
(M urray, Norris, and Bawendi 1993). Monodisperse magnetic nanocrystals with 
smaller sizes are produced when organometallic compounds thermally decom￾pose in highly flammable organic solvents with stabilizing surfactants ( Sun et al. 
2004). To minimize manipulation between phases and simplify synthesis control, 
Maria Eugenia F. Brollo et al. created a remarkable single- s tep methodology. In this 
instance, just before the creation of iron oxide, the Ag seeds are generated in the 
same reaction mixture. On a silver colloid produced in a certain reaction medium by 
the introduction of AgNO3 salt, the Fe3O4 precursor thermally decomposes resulting 
in Ag@Fe3O4 c ore– shell nanostructures ( Brollo et al. 2015).
3.3.3 C opreCipitation Method
In the coprecipitation approach, for the synthesis of core– shell nanoparticles, bases 
are often added to a combination of anhydrous Fe2+ or Fe3+ salts in the absence of air 58 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
at a higher or ambient temperature depending on the iron oxide ( Fe3O4 or γ-Fe2O3) 
nanoparticles needed. The coprecipitation technique is the name given to this pro￾cess. The precursor salt and reactivity parameters, such as pH, temperature, and ionic 
strength of the reaction mechanism, have a significant effect on the formation and 
structure of the magnetic nanocomposites that were prepared by the coprecipitation 
process. The two- step coprecipitation procedure was used to fabricate the magnetic 
 core– shell structures. The initial phase involved creating the magnetic core nano￾structures depending on Fe3O4, CoFe2O4, ZnCoFe2O4, etc. based on magnetic mate￾rials. The identical process used to synthesize the core was employed in step two, 
with the addition of the shell precursors, to cover the created core with a shell layer 
( Darwish et al. 2020).
3.3.4 hydrotherMal Method
A solid–liquid–solution array including metal C18H31O2 ( solid), ethanol C18H31O2
( liquid), and ethanol solution is used in the development under hydrothermal treat￾ment. By using a hydrothermal carbonization procedure, Fe3O4-C magnetic core–
 organic/ inorganic shell nanostructures with various shell thicknesses were created, 
and their physical, magnetic, and electromagnetic properties were studied by Omid 
Khani et al. ( 2016). Despite producing nanoparticles of exceptional quality, hydro￾thermal synthesis is a largely untapped technique for creating magnetic particles 
with different morphologies. On the other hand, coprecipitation and thermal decom￾position processes are currently used on a wide scale to create magnetic core– shell 
nanostructures.
3.4 TAILORING THE PROPERTIES OF MAGNETIC 
CORE–SHELL NANOSTRUCTURES
Nano optimization is a frequently used method to develop the desired properties of 
nanostructures. This process is known as tailoring because the attributes are inextri￾cably linked to the nanostructures and so are difficult to alter. Due to its significance 
in determining the scaling limitations of magnetic data, storage technology, and 
comprehending spin- dependent processes, nanoscale magnetism has received much 
interest. Core– shell nanostructures, wherein the magnetic core is covered with a cas￾ing of a nonferrous, or ferro– ferri- magnetic shell, antiferromagnetic, are an intrigu￾ing type of nanostructures, and the coating equipped is appropriate for the instance. 
Detailed research on magnetism, polarization, magnetization reversal processes, and 
interlayer couplings of the particles with various sizes and surface features would be 
possible in an array of monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles with regulated inter￾particle spacing. As the shell thickness varies, there can be two separate magnetic 
domains for core– shell magnetic nanoparticles: the exchange coupling domain, and 
the enhanced spin canting domains. The coupling relationship between the hard 
magnetic core and the soft magnetic shell has fascinated a lot of interest over the past 
years as a successful method of logically designing nanoparticles to control their 
magnetism. The modified magnetism of the core– shell nanostructures was studied by 
Moon et al. ( 2017) concerning the effects of shell thickness. They additionally shown Core–Shell Magnetic Nanostructures 59
are the effectiveness of magnetic features, increased energy products, and magnetic 
heating. Ultrathin- shelled nanoparticles can open up new possibilities for further 
customizing nanoscale magnetism in addition to the exchange coupling domain. The 
strong interaction between both the core and shell in a bimagnetic core/ shell, where 
the core and shell are indeed firmly magnetic, results in effective exchange aligning 
and consequently cooperative magnetic switching, making it easier to create nano￾structured magnetic materials with adjustable characteristics. The magnetization of 
these core– shell nanostructures may be customized by manipulating the core/ shell 
diameters and by adjusting the material parameters of both the core and shell. Zeng 
et al. ( 2004) fabricated a 3.5 nm thickness of FePt core with MFe2O4 (M= Fe, Cd) 
shell and postulated that such systems might exhibit intriguing nano- magnetism as a 
result of the exchange coupling between both the core and the shell, and they might 
produce materials that are precisely suited for different nano- magnetic applications.
3.5 APPLICATIONS OF MAGNETIC CORE–SHELL 
NANOSTRUCTURES
3.5.1 bioMediCal appliCations
The chemical nature of the core/ shell nanostructures, which boosts their tendency 
to associate with medicines, sensors, ligands, etc., makes them primarily suitable 
for biological applications. Due to their superior biological compatibility with bulk 
material, these new nanostructures have been created ( Sahoo and Labhasetwar 2003). 
Typically, the core substance is where core– shell nanostructures get their capacity to 
be compared. When compared with pure core particles, magnetic particles capped 
with a functional substance such as noble metals, semiconductors, or suitable oxide 
have improved electric, catalytic, magnetic, optical, and thermal capabilities. In gen￾eral, the shell content of core– shell nanostructures is in charge of surface character￾istics which alters the biological properties of the living systems which are in contact 
with the shell surfaces and the attachment of bioactive compounds due to the pres￾ence of reactive monomers on the surfaces. The thickness of the shell can be adjusted 
to give sufficient contrast qualities as a contrast agent and binding of biomolecules 
for purposes such as targeted drug administration, specific binding, biosensing, etc. 
Additionally, magnetic core– shell nanostructures can alter or change the covering 
components after fabrication, providing customized control over surface properties, 
functional groups, and the physical size of the nanoparticles.
3.5.1.1 Drug Delivery Nanocarriers
Magnetic core– shell nanostructures are being intensively researched as the next 
level of tailored drug delivery nanocarriers due to their distinct physicochemical 
features and capacity to operate at the molecular and cellular levels of the living 
systems. Magnetic core– shell drug delivery nanocarriers are used to treat cancer. 
The main option for the treatment of tumors is magnetic c ore– shell nanomateri￾als, particularly superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles because they can detect 
and treat cancer cells when an external magnetic field is manipulated, increasing 
the restorative effects of the drug ( Nguyen et al. 2016). These magnetic core– shell 
 60 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
nanostructures are accurate even though many drug delivery systems have huge 
potential in chemotherapy. Figure  3.3 depicts the drug release response of mag￾netic material ( hydrophobic Fe3O4) surface modified with HSCH2CH2COOCH3
capsules—encapsulated with stimuli-responsive smart polymer (e dextran-g-poly-
(NIPAAm-co-DMAAm)), designed for controlled release and magnetic drug tar￾geting ( Zhang and Misra 2007). Their superparamagnetic nature enables instant 
tumor treatment and malignant transformation monitoring with magnetic resonance 
FIGURE 3.3 Schematic illustration of the step-by-step preparation of core–shell magnetic 
nanocarriers. Adapted with permission from Reference ( Zhang and Misra 2007), Copyright

imaging ( MRI). Surface functionalization has received a lot of attention as a key 
technique for overcoming the drawbacks of conventional superparamagnetic iron 
oxide nanoparticles. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were created with 
heparin polymer by Hoang Thi et al. ( 2019), who also claimed that the c ore– shell had 
the preferred size range and a comparatively high drug loading effectiveness with￾out significantly altering their morphological characteristics, crystalline structure, or 
distinctive magnetic properties.
3.5.1.2 Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI)
Magnetic resonance imaging or nuclear MRI is a crucial non- invasive image process￾ing technology that makes use of the magnetic properties of the numerous interact￾ing magnetic nuclei that are prevalent within humans to examine internal biological 
components with precision. The overall magnetism of the magnetic nuclei within a 
person’s body aligns with the orientation of a strong static magnetic field when they 
are sustained under it. These magnetic nuclei can collect this radiation and switch the 
spin to the opposite direction when excited by some other external electromagnetic 
field with the appropriate frequency which is known as the resonance frequency. 
As drug delivery carriers, “ magnetic drug delivery” is the term for magnetic fi eld- 
 induced drug delivery systems ( Mandal 2016). Injecting magnetic nanoparticles with 
drugs inside the living system and directing them to a target spot under the guidance 
of a magnetic field gradient is the principle behind magnetic drug delivery. These 
nanoparticles are kept at the treatment site until it is complete, at which point they are 
eliminated. This method allowed for the creation of high local concentrations of the 
targeted medicine, minimizing toxic effects and other unwanted concomitant effects 
on healthy cells in the remainder of the body.
3.5.1.3 Cancer Therapy
 Figure 3.4 illustrates the core– shell nanostructures of magnetic core covered with 
polymer coating for cancer therapy, herein a suitable linker was used to decorate the 
external polymer coating encasing the anticancer agent with an imaging agent for 
improved imaging and/ or a targeting ligand for active targeting ( Mitra et al. 2015). 
In addition, the use of folic acid coupled FePt@Fe2O3-PEG nanomaterials facilitates 
effective targeting of tumor cells that express the folate receptor. To distribute the 
chemotherapeutic medication doxorubicin to these nanomaterials in a targeted man￾ner for the destruction of cancer cells, hydrophobic adsorption is used. These FePt@
Fe2O3- PEG nanomaterials have been used i n- vivo MRI to produce tumor magnetic 
resonance contrasts that may either be used to start targeting the tumor or aggregate 
in a passive tumor. For synchronized magnetic resonance imaging as well as drug 
delivery, unique, monodisperse, and properly sized- regulated core– shell nanostruc￾tures with Fe3O4@ mesoporous- silica with a size of less than 100 nm were used ( Kim 
et al. 2008).
3.5.2 eleCtroCheMiCal appliCations
Instruments like sensors can gauge a quantitative measurement and transform it into a 
signal that can be interpreted by a person or an instrument, whether analog or digital. 
 62 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

Magnetic c ore–s hell nanostructures are utilized as sensors for the detection of damaged 
cells, glucose, DNA, cholesterol, RNA, etc. in in- v ivo applications. A fluorescence- 
 coated magnetic substance can be utilized as a sensor. Here, the magnetic coating 
works to transmit heat at that point via magnetic excitation, while the fluorescent dye 
monitors the position of the particle. As bioanalytical sensors, magnetic- based core– 
 shell nanocomposites covered with any additional material, such as a fluorescent one, 
silica, a metallic, or a polymer, are employed. The identification of damaged DNA is 
carried out specifically using Fe/ Fe2O3 core– shell nanostructures (Q iu et al. 2010). 
These particles have bioactive proteins including cytochrome, myoglobin, and hemo￾globin linked to them to simulate the toxicity that occurs in living organisms.
3.5.3 s pintroniCs
The embellished magnetic properties of bimagnetic core– shell nanostructures 
are highly favorable for the feasibility of application in spintronic devices, owing 
to the tunability of their magnetic properties, such as their ability to dominate the 
superparamagnetic edge and adaptability. It attributes to the probable advantages of 
magnetic bubble memory, data retrieval, curtail consumption of power, size reduc￾tion of devices, speedy performance, logic operations, etc. The ongoing drive for 
device component downsizing is a particularly significant driving force in spintron￾ics ( Hossain et al. 2018). Electronics that are based on spin are known as spintronics. 
Utilizing both the electron’s charge and spin is the notion. The two orientations that 
electrons can spin are Spin-U p and S pin-D own, that is clockwise and anticlockwise 
orientations are measurable as indistinct magnetic energy. Khurshid et al. ( 2014) by 
examining the exchange bias in Fe/γ-Fe2O3 (ferro/ferri) core–shell nanostructures 
with a range of particle sizes ( 8–1 5 nm) illustrated that there is a critical particle size 
(1 0 nm) above where the interface spin consequence governs the exchange bias, but Core–Shell Magnetic Nanostructures 63
below which the surface spin effect becomes more significant. This finding clarified 
the cause of the noticed exchange bias effects and offered a method for adjusting 
exchange bias in core– shell nanostructures for spintronic applications.
3.5.4 M agnetiC nanopartiCles funCtionalization strategies
By functionalizing the surface of nanomaterials, it is possible to produce strong binding 
and active sites for biomolecules and nanostructured materials. Magnetic nanoparticle 
functionalization of metals and polymers increases their effectiveness by making them 
reusable. A variety of nanomaterials, such as metal oxide nanoparticles, carbon- based 
nanomaterials, synthetic and natural polymers, antibodies, biomolecules, and zwitter￾ionic materials, have all been used as functionalization agents. One important feature 
is that the surface hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity can be adjusted by precoating or 
functionalizing nanoparticles. Reza Eivazzadeh- Keihan et al. proposed the functional￾ization of magnetic nanoparticles decorated with metal ions such as iron, copper, nickel, 
gallium, cobalt, or zinc are powerful candidates for the separation and purification of 
 histidine- tagged proteins. F igure 3.5 represents the schematic of magnetic nanoparticles 
decorated with diverse metals for the separation and purification of binding proteins. 
A commonly used tag for such protein purification is the histidine tag. In histidine, 
there are six or more sequential histidine residues. The binding of histidine- tagged pro￾teins and subsequent purification in the suitable column is used to purify proteins for 
which there is no specific affinity column used ( Eivazzadeh- Keihan et al. 2021). Junhua 
You et al. presented a report on amino- functionalized magnetic nanoparticles for water 
purification mainly based on three major mechanisms that consist of ( i) impurities are 
attracted to the surface of the activated magnetic nanoparticles by chelation, electro￾static, or complexation; ( ii) magnetic nanoparticles are removed magnetically from the 
solutions; and ( iii) the magnetic nanoparticles are recovered again, and this happens 
efficiently when surface functionalization occurs ( You et al. 2021). New reports in the 
identification and detachment of toxic heavy metal ions utilizing colorimetric or fluoro￾metric systems were reported by Jong Hwa Jung et al. They also reported the preparation 
of a diverse array of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles and their implementations 
in multiple environmental fields. Due to the simplicity of covalently linking suitable 
functional organic molecules, magnetic nanoparticles like Fe3O4, Fe3C, Ni@SiO2, and 
Fe3O4@SiO2 are ideal as supporting materials to manufacture functional hybrid nano￾materials via the sol- gel gluing approach ( Jung, Lee, and Shinkai 2011) ( Figure 3.5).
3.6 C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK
With the formation of a novel class of materials known as hybrid core– shell nanostruc￾tures, nanotechnology has ushered in a new era for achieving revolutionary applica￾tions. Constructing core– shell nanostructures with various surface- coating techniques 
has made it possible to attain the versatility of nanomaterials. Future research in this 
area will lead to significant advancements in the synthesis, characteristics, alteration, 
and usage of this new class of nanomaterials. The combinations of core and shell mate￾rials, the magnetic properties of core– shell nanostructure synthesis, and their various 
applications are discussed in this chapter. It is particularly advantageous because the 64 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

4.1 INTRODUCTION
Compared with bulk materials, nanomaterials possessing magnetic properties have 
been widely used in various fields such as electronics, materials sciences, and bio￾medical sciences due to their many advantages. Generally, magnetic nanomaterials 
consist of an inorganic core with paramagnetic or superparamagnetic properties and 
a second organic or inorganic layer that provides stability, solubility, or differen￾tial properties ( Lu et al. 2007; Yildiz 2016). In recent years, developments in both 
synthesis and characterization techniques have offered new opportunities to obtain 
magnetic nanoparticles with controlled magnetic properties ( Peixoto et  al. 2020). 
Especially magnetic nanoparticles are one of the most remarkable nanomaterials in 
the biomedical field because of their nontoxicity, biocompatibility, and remote control 
property by applying a magnetic field ( Fraceto and de Araujo 2014; Gao et al. 2014). 
In the biomedical field, functional magnetic nanoparticles are generally utilized in 
treatment applications such as drug delivery, hyperthermia, neutron capture therapy

( NCT), imaging applications such as magnetic resonance imaging (M RI), magnetic 
particle imaging ( MPI) and computed tomography ( CT), and separation and detec￾tion applications for nucleic acids, proteins, and cells as depicted in F igure 4.1.
Magnetic nanoparticles can be grouped into pure metals, metal oxides, and magnetic 
nanocomposites. Cobalt, iron, nickel, titanium, and iron oxides or some ferrites such as 
BaFe12O19, CoFe2O4, and MnFe2O4 can be employed as magnetic nanoparticles in bio￾medical applications. However, cobalt and nickel, which are highly magnetic sensitive 
materials, are toxic and susceptible to oxidation, causing a barrier to their biomedical 
use ( Cardoso et al. 2018; Majidi et al. 2016). On the contrary, iron oxide nanoparticles 
such as magnetite (F e3O4) and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) are the most studied and applied in 
the biomedical field owing to their biocompatibility, superparamagnetic behavior, and 
chemical stability at room temperature ( Li et al. 2016; Majidi et al. 2016). Magnetite 
has an inverted spinel structure and ferromagnetic features. T hirty- two oxygen ions 
form a face- centered cubic structure, and half of the Fe3+ ions occupy the tetrahedral 
sites, and Fe2+ ions and half of the Fe3+ ions occupy the octahedral sites in the unit cell. 
The chemical formula of magnetite is ( Fe3+) ( 2+ tet. Fe Fe3+)oct.O4 (t et.: tetrahedral site; oct.: 
octahedral site). In the maghemite structure, 32 oxygen ions form a cubic close- packed 
structure, and Fe3+ ions are located in tetrahedral and octahedral sites in this structure. Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications 69
Unlike magnetite structure, maghemite has a vacancy of Fe2+ ions in its structure. The 
chemical formula of maghemite is 0.75( Fe3+)tet.(Fe3+5/3V1/3)oct.O4 ( tet.: tetrahedral site; 
V: Fe2+ vacancy; oct.: octahedral site) ( Shabatina et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2015). Magnetic 
iron oxide nanoparticles, which can be synthesized by various methods such as hydro/ 
solvothermal, coprecipitation, thermal decomposition, and s ol- gel, can be obtained in 
spherical, nanorod, nanowire, and nanocube morphologies depending on the require￾ments of the application areas ( Monteserín et al. 2021). However, instead of being used 
without modification, magnetic nanoparticles to be applied in the biomedical field 
should be functionalized to prevent aggregation in the body and provide colloidal sta￾bility, increase their biocompatibility, ensure transport to specific regions, and increase 
transport efficiency or gain different properties ( Cardoso et al. 2018).
4.2 FUNCTIONALIZATION OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES 
FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS
As stated in the previous part, the synthesized nanoparticles should also be bio￾compatible in addition to desired shapes and sizes for biomedical applications. 
Functionalizing the surfaces of nanoparticles is a process that can be applied to 
reduce or eliminate their toxic side effects ( Markides et al. 2012). In addition, the 
functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles with diverse structures can also be aimed 
at changing cell interactions and their distribution in the body, as well as making them 
biocompatible. The second or other layers on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles 
also provide some advantages, such as protecting the active agents carried into the 
body and increasing the delivery efficiency and also preventing their accumulation in 
the undesired region in the body ( Cardoso et al. 2018; Ruiz et al. 2014). However, it 
should be noted that every modification or coating performed on the nanoparticle sur￾face causes a decrease in magnetization, so optimizing the amount of modification or 
coating thickness depending on the magnetization behavior of magnetic nanoparticles 
will eliminate the negative situations that may occur ( Duan and Li 2013). Studies 
have indicated that changes in the surface charges of nanoparticles with functionaliza￾tion are essential for interactions with biological molecules. For example, iron oxide 
nanoparticles with a positive surface charge can aggregate and are more easily uptake 
by cells with a negative charge. Administration of high doses of positively charged 
nanoparticles can cause nonspecific accumulation in cells, resulting in a toxic effect 
(Liu et al. 2013). Conversely, nanoparticles with negative and neutral surface charges 
are appropriate for targeted imaging probes and drug delivery applications where long 
circulation times in the body are needed ( Blanco et al. 2015; Cardoso et al. 2018).
Until now, many organic and inorganic structures have been employed to func￾tionalize magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. The most common organic structures for 
functionalization are polyethylene glycol ( PEG) ( Bloemen et al. 2012), polyvinylpyr￾rolidone ( PVP) ( Torresan et al. 2021), polydopamine ( PDA) ( Icten et al. 2022), chitosan 
(Song et al. 2015), and dextran, while inorganic structures for that are silica, Au, and 
Ag ( Korolkov et al. 2020). However, modifications are not limited to these structures. 
Apart from these, diverse organic and inorganic materials can be utilized for surface 
functionalization. Therefore, many examples of these structures are given in T able 4.1 
with application area, and also some of these studies are described in detail below.70 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

The surfaces of nanoparticles synthesized in an organic solvent environment 
are generally hydrophilic, which poses a significant obstacle to biomedical appli￾cations. In this respect, their surfaces should be modified with hydrophilic ligands 
for use in various biomedical applications ( Huang et al. 2022). PEG is a synthetic, 
hydrophilic, and biocompatible polymer that is most widely used for surface modi￾fication ( Icten 2021b). For instance, Bloemen et al. functionalized the superpara￾magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with various trialkoxy silanes, which have PEG 
chains, carboxylic acid, amine, and thiol groups, to increase their colloidal stabil￾ity and enable further modifications. Amine and thiol groups can act as anchor 
points for further functionalization with gold nanoparticles; PEG chains allow 
nanoparticles to be dispersed in aqueous media, and modifications with carboxylic 
acid and amine groups can be used for the bioconjugation of proteins. In this study, 
oleic acid- coated iron oxide nanoparticles with an average size of 9.3 nm were 
modified with these groups under an ultrasonic bath in a shorter time. The colloidal 
stability of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles in different environments such 
as various pHs, human plasma, and serum was investigated. The results obtained 
from this study revealed that especially PEG and carboxylic a cid- modified iron 
oxide nanoparticles might hold promise for future in vivo experiments ( Bloemen 
et al. 2012).

Another widely used coating agent polymer is PVP, which possesses biodegrad￾able and nontoxic features. As an example study, Ehteshamzadeh et al. developed 
 PVP- capped magnetite nanoparticles for doxorubicin ( DOX) drug delivery. In this 
study, iron oxide nanoparticles with a 35 nm average size were first coated with tet￾raethyl orthosilicate ( TEOS) and then with (( 3- aminopropyl) triethoxysilane) APTES 
after they were synthesized by the coprecipitation method. Magnetic nanopar￾ticles modified with silica were also coated with PVP to load the DOX and con￾trol release. The results of the analysis showed that the drug release increased in an 
acidic environment which was strong enough to break the bond between the DOX 
and PVP ( Ehteshamzadeh et al. 2021). Another study in which PVP modification 
was performed was carried out by Li et al. In this study, oleic a cid- coated iron oxide 
nanoparticles (γ-Fe2O3) were prepared by thermal decomposition. However, since 
these prepared nanoparticles were not soluble in aqueous media, they were coated 
with PVP to provide hydrophilic properties. PVP- coated γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles 
exhibited the saturation magnetization of 57.7 emu/ g at 295 K, which can be sufficient 
to provide a T2- weighted image on MRI ( Li et al. 2015).
PDA, which has catechol and amine groups, is another exciting polymer in 
biomedical applications because it is easily coated, biocompatible, hydrophilic, 
and allows further modification. In addition, PDA molecules coated on the sur￾face of nanoparticles also provide a reduction of some metals such as silver and 
gold to the surface. ( Icten 2021a). Icten et al. coated m ulti- core manganese ferrite 
nanoparticles (MnFe2O4) with PDA to reduce gold nanoparticles and bind boron 
atoms to the surfaces of the nanoparticles, as shown in Figure  4.2. MnFe2O4
FIGURE  4.2 The preparation routes of MnFe2O4@PDA-Au-BA nanoparticles. Adapted 
from ( Icten et al. 2022), ACS.74 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
nanoparticles prepared by the solvothermal method possessed sizes of 10– 15 nm, 
and m ulti- core nanoparticles with a total size of 1 00– 200 nm were coated with 
PDA ( thickness of 30– 40 nm). After spherical gold nanoparticles with 20– 30 nm 
dimensions were reduced on the surface of the PDA- coated MnFe2O4 nanopar￾ticles, boric acid was attached via catechol groups of PDA. The final sample 
(MnFe2O4@ PDA- A u- BA) indicated no significant cell death and may be a poten￾tial candidate for various biomedical applications, MRI, NCT, and photothermal 
therapy ( Icten et al. 2022).
Unlike the iron oxide nanoparticles, Chiang et al. prepared superparamagnetic 
FePt nanoparticles with 2– 3 nm size by chemical reduction method for biomedical 
applications such as detecting specific biomolecules. In this study, FePt nanopar￾ticles were modified with mercaptoacetic acid to provide them dispersed in an aque￾ous environment. Further functionalization of mercaptoacetic acid- modified FePt 
nanoparticles was achieved with streptavidin- biotin pair, which is a biomolecule 
binding tool ( Chiang et al. 2007).
Chitosan, a natural polysaccharide, is a p H- sensitive polymer and occurs of 
β-(1–4)-2-acetamido-d-glucose and β-(1–4)-2-amino-d-glucose units. Due to its
low cost, controlled release of active drugs, biocompatibility, biodegradability, 
and nontoxicity, chitosan is utilized as a coating material in biomedical appli￾cations such as MRI and targeted drug delivery ( Assa et al. 2017). The study 
related to developing biofunctionalized chitosan/ Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles 
for MRI application performed by Song et  al. can be an example of chitosan 
modification for magnetic nanoparticles. In this study, chitosan ( CS) was firstly 
modified with PEG and lactobionic acid ( LA), then Fe3O4 nanoparticles with 
approximately 14.1 nm in size, prepared by coprecipitation method, were encap￾sulated with PEG/ LA- CS through self- assembly. These modifications for mag￾netic nanoparticles can contribute to improving their circulation time, water 
solubility, biocompatibility, and targeting of hepatocytes ( via lactobionic acid) 
(Song et al. 2015).
Silica coating is widely preferred for modifying magnetic nanoparticles to be 
used in the biomedical field, as it provides biocompatibility and further func￾tionalization ( Kim et  al. 2018). For instance, the combined modifications were 
performed on iron oxide nanoparticles before carborane immobilization for 
BNCT applications in a study performed by Korolko et al., as seen in F igure 4.3. 
Carboranes are boron- rich compounds used as agents in BNCT, but carriers such 
as iron oxide nanoparticles are needed to deliver an effective dose of boron iso￾topes to the tumor site since carboranes cannot be targeted directly to tumor sites. 
Therefore, some surface functionalizations are required beforehand as carboranes 
cannot be directly immobilized to the surfaces of iron oxide nanoparticles. Firstly, 
the iron oxide nanoparticles were coated with silica and 3- ( trimethoxysilyl) propyl 
methacrylate ( TMSPM) to induce C=C double bond formation, and then biocom￾patible glycidyl methacrylate ( GMA) was attached to the C=C double bonds on 
the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles via graft polymerization. Lastly, Isopropyl- 
 o- carborane was immobilized on the surface of the final functional nanoparticle 
through covalent bonding via the catalytic azide- alkyne cycloaddition ( Korolkov 
et al. 2020).Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications 75

Guo et al. developed a new imprinted material (F e3O4@SiO2/M IPs) for selective 
glycoprotein detection. Glycoproteins play an essential role in the determination of 
some diseases. Detection of low glycoprotein levels is challenging due to the complex 
sample structure and the presence of trace amounts in biological samples. However, 
this study indicated that the new imprinted material formed by the combination of 
molecularly imprinted polymer ( MIP) and iron oxide nanoparticles had a high bind￾ing capacity and fast mass transfer rate toward the sample glycoprotein. As seen in 
this study, bare iron oxide nanorods could not be employed directly due to the forma￾tion of aggregates related to the high magnetization and the absence of active groups 
on the surface. Instead, the nanorods were coated with silica shells to improve their 
biocompatibility and hydrophilicity (G uo et al. 2022).
The surfaces of magnetic nanoparticles can also be modified with organic or inor￾ganic dyes to visualize cells. In the sample study, Perlstein et al. prepared fluorescent￾l abeled magnetic nanoparticles by a novel method based on nucleation and controlled 
the growth of iron oxide layers on the iron oxide/g elatin-d ye structure. Rhodamine 
isothiocyanate ( RITC) as a fluorescent dye was covalently bound to gelatin via thio￾urea bonds, and then maghemite- type iron oxide (γ-Fe2O3) thin films were grown 
 gelatin- RITC/ iron oxide nuclei to obtain fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles. The 
reason for the covalent bonding of the RITC was to improve the probe property 
while maintaining the size and magnetic properties of nanoparticles. In addition, the 
leaving of the RITC from the structure could be prevented by covalent bonding. As 
a result, the fluorescent- labeled magnetic nanoparticles may be effective for labeling 
and imaging in biological applications ( Perlstein et al. 2010).76 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
4.3 BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS OF FUNCTIONALIZED 
MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
4.3.1 treatMent appliCations
One of the most effective methods to destroy cancerous cells is chemotherapy, in 
which anticancer drugs are applied to patients. Although these anticancer drugs are 
not selective for cancer cells and damage normal cells, they are still developed to kill 
cancerous cells. The other major problems with anticancer drugs are that they have 
low solubility in the biological environment, cannot be transported to the desired area, 
and have low treatment efficacy ( Materón et al. 2021; Talegaonkar and Bhattacharyya 
2019; Tran et al. 2020). However, such barriers can be reduced by using magnetic 
nanocarriers that enable the delivery of anticancer drugs to the desired region. For 
example, Fe3O4@SiO2@alginate/ carbon quantum dots ( CQDs) nanohybrid material 
was synthesized in a newly published study by Molaei and Salimi for anticancer drug 
delivery. In order to ensure colloidal stability, the magnetic nanoparticles were modi￾fied with alginate, an anionic hydrophilic copolymer. In addition, alginate can be eas￾ily eliminated from the body due to its biodegradability after drug release. Finally, 
the hybrid material possessed the fluorescent emission ability by attaching CQDs to 
the surface of a lginate- modified magnetic nanoparticles. In this way, the nanohybrid 
material can be used simultaneously in drug delivery and bioimaging applications. 
The drug loading efficiency of Fe3O4@SiO2@alginate/ CQDs was 81% and showed 
a higher drug release rate ( 38%) at pH 5.5 compared to pH 7.4 ( 25%) ( Molaei and 
Salimi 2022). In another study performed by Avedian et al., a different anticancer 
drug, Erlotinib, was loaded into the magnetic carrier. After Fe3O4 nanoparticles were 
coated with mesoporous silica, Erlotinib was loaded, and folic acid conjugated poly 
( ethyleneimine) ( PEI- FA) was modified to the functional nanoparticles. Similar to 
the previous study, Erlotinib release was higher at a pH of 5.5 ( 63%) than at a pH of 
7.4 ( 33%). While the unloaded functional nanoparticles did not show significant toxic 
effects, Erlotinib- loaded magnetic nanoparticles inhibited the proliferation of HeLa 
cells ( Avedian et al. 2018). Another study in which functional magnetic nanopar￾ticles were used as drug carriers was carried out by Dhavale et  al. In this study, 
Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized with a coprecipitation method and directly 
modified with APTES to provide amino groups on the surface. Telmisartan, as a 
model anticancer drug, was loaded on the A PTES- modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles. 
The loading of the drug into the functional magnetic nanoparticles was provided by 
the amide bond formed between the amino group of APTES and the carboxyl group 
of Telmisartan. The maximum drug loading ratio ( 85.6%) was obtained in the load￾ing experiments possessing the A PTES- modified Fe3O4 / drug ratio of 15/ 1. While 
the amide bond was stable at physiological pH, it degraded in acidic environments 
to allow controlled drug release. Telmisartan- loaded and APTES- modified Fe3O4
nanoparticles showed a dose- dependent cytotoxic effect on the PC- 3 human prostate 
cancer cell line ( Dhavale et al. 2018).
Hyperthermia is another cancer treatment method that utilizes magnetic nanopar￾ticles and has recently attracted attention because it has fewer side effects than 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In this treatment method, magnetic nanoparticles Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications 77
are localized to the tumor regions, and these regions are heated with the externally 
applied magnetic field to magnetic nanoparticles. The death of cancer cells occurs 
when the temperature rises above 42°C–43°C depending on the heat generated. The 
heating efficiency can be defined by using the thermal dose and the specific absorp￾tion rate ( SAR). In this respect, developing magnetic nanoparticles with low thermal 
dose and high SAR value is crucial for hyperthermia applications ( Fatima et al. 2021; 
Sanad et al. 2021). As seen in the equation “ SAR = absorbed power/ mass of magnetic 
nanoparticles”, the SAR value is defined as the efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles 
in converting magnetic energy into heat ( Huang et al. 2012). In clinical applications, 
the applied magnetic field frequency and the optimum applied AC magnetic field are 
two of the most critical parameters affecting heating efficiency. However, increasing 
frequency and high field raise the application cost, so applying these values at opti￾mum levels would be beneficial. In a study performed by Hergt and Dutz ( 2007), it 
was stated that the frequency and field amplitude values of 500 kHz and 10 kA m−1, 
respectively, were sufficient for hyperthermia applications.
The study published by Daboin et al. can be presented as an exciting study for hyper￾thermia application. Manganese- cobalt ferrite nanoparticles ( Mn1-xCoxFe2O4) were 
coated with SiO2 and decorated with Au@Fe3O4 nanoparticles, as shown in Figure 4.4a. 
The magnetic properties of the nanocomposite ( Au@Fe3O4-SiO2-Mn1-xCoxFe2O4) were 
investigated using a vibrating sample magnetometer depending on the Mn2+ content. It 
was observed that the saturation magnetization values of nanocomposites decreased 
with the increase of Mn2+ contents due to the decrease in the numbers of Mn2+ ions in 
the octahedral site ( Figure 4.4b). The temperature change curves in the water and SAR 
values of Au@Fe3O4 decorated and undecorated SiO2-Mn1-xCoxFe2O4 nanocomposites 
are shown in F igure 4. 4c– e. Hyperthermia experiments were performed at an alternat￾ing magnetic field of 5.5 mT ( frequency of 454 20 ± kHz). When the temperature rise 
and SAR values of decorated and undecorated nanocomposites were examined, it was 
seen that the decorated nanocomposites possessed higher values. The high tempera￾ture and SAR values of decorated nanocomposites could be due to the contribution of 
Au@Fe3O4 nanoparticles to the total magnetization because SAR values are directly 
proportional to the nanoparticle’s effective diameter and magnetization ( Daboin et al.
2019). In addition to these studies, various functional magnetic nanoparticles such 
as Fe3O4@YPO4:5Eu ( Prasad et al. 2013), ZnxCo1–xFe2O4@MnFe2O4 ( Hammad et al.
2016), Mn 3+ 3+ 0.25Fe2.75O4-PEG (Saputra et  al. 2019), NaYF4:Er /Yb @SiO2@AuNP@
Fe3O4 ( Soni et al. 2019), Fe3O4/ RGO/ PEG ( RGO: reduced graphene oxide) ( Alkhayal 
et al. 2021), and Fe3O4@ZnO ( Gupta et al. 2021) have been tried for hyperthermia 
applications in recent years.
Another method used to treat various tumors, such as brain, head, and neck, is 
neutron capture therapy ( NCT). 10B and 157Gd isotopes are commonly used agents 
for NCT, as they possess high c ross- section values, 3840 and 254,000 barn ( barn: 
10−24 cm2
), respectively ( Icten 2021b). The treatment method using the 10B isotope 
is entitled boron neutron capture therapy ( BNCT), while the method using the 157Gd 
isotope is called gadolinium neutron capture therapy ( GdNCT). BNCT is a method 
based on the production of h igh- energy particles such as 4He2+ (α-particle) and a7Li3+
ion formed as a result of the nuclear reaction between the 10B isotope and thermal 
neutrons. As shown in the reaction ( 4.1), the energy particles formed by the nuclear 78 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

reaction cause the destruction of cancerous cells because the particles transfer all 
energy to cancer cells, and their average path is smaller than the radius of a cell ( 4– 9 
µm). Therefore, they only destroy cancerous cells in the region where they are located 
without harming normal tissues ( Icten 2021c). In the GdNCT method ( reaction 4.2), 
after the 157Gd isotope is irradiated with thermal neutrons, internal conversion, and 
Auger–Coster–Kronig (ACK) electrons are formed together with X-ray and photon 
emissions. ACK electrons have the highest linear energy transfer ( LET) value ( 0.3 
MeV/µm; LET: 0.2 MeV/µm for BNCT) and are the most effective in destroying can￾cer cells ( De Stasio et al. 2005).Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications 79

One of the essential requirements for both BNCT and GdNCT methods is to accumu￾late a sufficient number of isotopes in cancer cells ( 25– 35 µg10B/ g tumor for BNCT; 
50–200 µg157Gd/ g tumor for GdNCT). The combination of NCT agents with mag￾netic nanoparticles ensures sufficient accumulation of isotopes in cancerous cells by 
magnetic targeting ( Hosmane 2011). Therefore, there is increasing interest in NCT 
agents containing magnetic nanoparticles ( Icten et al. 2022).
Dukenbayev et  al. synthesized the Fe3O4- carborane nanoparticles for BNCT 
application. After preparing Fe3O4 nanoparticles with a size of about 18.9 nm by the 
coprecipitation method, their surfaces were modified with an amino group using 
(3-aminopropyl)-trimethoxysilane (APTMS). The carborane borate containing 21
boron atoms was attached to the surface of nanoparticles through the ionic interaction 
between the amino group and borate. Incubation of the mouse embryonic fibroblasts 
( MEFs) cells with Fe3O4- carborane nanoparticles for 24 hours caused no toxic effect 
up to the concentration of 0.015 mg/ mL. Additionally, Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibited 
an IC50 value of 0.110 mg/ mL while Fe3O4- carborane nanoparticles showed that of 
0.405 mg/ mL. It was concluded that the nanoparticles developed in this study have 
the potential to be used in BNCT ( Dukenbayev et al. 2019). Unlike the iron oxide 
nanoparticles, Torresan et al. developed biocompatible Fe- B nanoparticles for MRI- 
 guided BNCT applications. In this study, Fe- B nanoparticles were synthesized with the 
laser ablation in liquid ( LAL) method, which is a straightforward, l ow- cost approach 
to preparing bimetallic nanoparticles. Additionally, Fe- B nanoparticles were coated 
with PVP, which is a biocompatible polymer, while the process was carried out in the 
presence of PVP solution in acetone. The final biocompatible Fe- B nanoparticles had 
a 1.0:0.4 atomic ratio for Fe/ B, an average size of 26 nm, and a saturation magnetiza￾tion of 70 emu/ g Fe. Fe- B nanoparticles showed a nontoxic effect in the concentration 
range of 1–100 µg mL−1 and degradation in the lysosomal environment, which con￾tributes to their clearance via the liver- spleen- kidney pathway ( Torresan et al. 2021).
Compared to BNCT applications, a few studies have been related to functional 
magnetic nanoparticles containing gadolinium for GdNCT applications ( Eguía￾Eguía et al. 2021; Gao et al. 2013; Pylypchuk et al. 2016; Zibert et al. 2022). One 
of the magnetic nanoparticles possessing the potential use for GdNCT applications 
is the GdFeO3/Fe3O4/SiO2 nanocomposite prepared by Gao et  al. After GdFeO3
nanoparticles with a size of 60 nm were synthesized by gel combustion method, 80 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
Fe3O4 was deposited on it and then coated with silica. The room- temperature magne￾tization of GdFeO3/Fe3O4/SiO2 nanocomposite was 48.7 emu/ g, and results indicated 
that the developed nanocomposite could be helpful for GdNCT applications ( Gao 
et al. 2013). In a different study, Pylypchuk et al. tried the absorption of G d- DTPA 
(Gd-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic) into the chitosan-magnetic nanocomposite pre￾pared by the coprecipitation method. According to the thermal analysis results, it 
was determined that there was 4.6% chitosan by mass in the c hitosan- magnetic nano￾composite. Additionally, despite the low chitosan content, an absorption rate of 0.06 
mmol Gd- DTPA per gram of composite was achieved, resulting that it may be a 
potential candidate for GdNCT application ( Pylypchuk et al. 2016).
In order to increase the effectiveness of the treatment, various studies have also 
been carried out on the development of functional magnetic nanocarriers with both 
10B and 157Gd isotopes ( Icten et al. 2018; Korolkov et al. 2021). For instance, Korolkov 
et al. reported the new NCT agent formed by gadolinium and carborane modification 
on the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. After the iron oxide nanopar￾ticles were synthesized by the coprecipitation method, the same modifications such 
as polyelectrolyte poly( acrylic acid) ( PAA)/ poly( allylamine) ( PALAm) formation 
and immobilization of gadolinium and carborane were carried out on the surface, 
respectively. Boron and gadolinium amounts in the modified sample were calculated 
as 0.077 and 0.632 mg/ g, and the coercivity and room- temperature magnetization 
values were determined as 8.1 and 43.1 emu/ g, respectively. In addition, the toxic 
effects of the final sample on different cancer cell lines such as BxPC- 3, PC- 3 MCF- 
 7, HepG2, and L929 and normal cells such as human skin fibroblasts were inves￾tigated with different concentrations. Gadolinium- immobilized nanoparticles were 
found to have more toxic effects than n on- g adolinium- immobilized nanoparticles. 
Moreover, it was observed that the cell line, which was most sensitive to toxicity, was 
 BxPC- 3, and the most likely mechanism for the toxic effect could be oxidative stress. 
The result obtained from this study is that carborane and gadolinium- modified Fe3O4
nanoparticles could be appropriate candidates for NCT ( Korolkov et al. 2021). In 
another study by Icten et al., citric acid or folic acid- modified GdBO3-Fe3O4 nano￾composites were prepared, and cell experiments were carried out against different 
cell lines such as Mia-Pa-Ca-2, HeLa, and A549. The 10B and 157Gd contents in the 
prepared nanocomposite were approximately 1014 atom/μg samples, making these 
nanocomposites suitable candidates for BNCT, GdNCT, and even GdBNCT ( Icten 
et al. 2018).
4.3.2 iMaging appliCations
MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique widely used in the medical field and offers 
advantages such as superior anatomical detail and soft- tissue image, high spatial 
resolution, and usage of nonionizing radiation. These advantages of this technique 
not only allow for the identification of diseases and lesions that are difficult to define 
but also provide opportunities to evaluate some treatment outcomes. However, it is 
necessary to use contrast agents that increase the image contrast in order to deter￾mine the differences between tissues in MRI. Gadolinium ( III) chelate structures 
are primarily used as contrast agents in clinical applications, but there are concerns Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications 81
over toxicity problems of these structures ( Bañobre- López et al. 2017; Peixoto et al.
2020). In this respect, magnetic nanoparticles, especially superparamagnetic iron 
oxide nanoparticles, which are utilized as T2 contrast agents, are considered an 
alternative to gadolinium ( III) chelate structures owing to their biocompatibility, 
easy surface modification, and high magnetic moment ( Bañobre- López et al. 2017). 
Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles also contribute to tumor imaging, meta￾static breast cancer imaging, imaging of lymph nodes, detection of stem cells, and 
Alzheimer’s disease ( Yildiz 2016).
Demin et al. prepared N-(phosphonomethyl)-iminodiacetic acid (PMIDA) modi￾fied Fe3O4 nanoparticles ( MNPs- PMIDA) for MRI application. Compared to PEG 
and bovine serum albumin ( BSA), the best stabilizer, PMIDA, was chosen to stabi￾lize the iron oxide nanoparticles. As it is known, phosphonic derivatives can interact 
strongly with the surfaces of iron oxide nanoparticles by forming P- O - Fe bonds. 
While the phosphate groups in the PMIDA structure bind to the surfaces of the iron 
oxide nanoparticles, the carboxyl groups provide colloidal stability. Optimum con￾ditions for modifying Fe3O4 nanoparticles were determined as a reaction tempera￾ture of 40°C, a reaction time of 3.5 hours, and the equimolar amount of PMIDA. 
The MNPs- PMIDA nanoparticles exhibited good colloidal stability and magnetic 
features for biological applications. The relaxivity values of r2 and r1 for MNPs- 
 PMIDA nanoparticles were calculated as 341 and 102 mmol−1 s−1, respectively, 
which were higher than some commercial samples such as Resovist ( r2 151.0 and 
r −1 1 25.4 mmol s−1), Feridex ( r2 98.3 and r1 23.9 mmol−1 s−1) ( Demin et al. 2018). In 
another example study, Sheng et al. developed a multi- functional magnetic nano￾platform that allows fluorescence imaging and MRI with magnetic hyperthermia. 
The magnetic ( MnxFe1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles were prepared with the thermal com￾position method and then coated with a SiO2 shell incorporated with fluorescein 
isothiocyanate. Finally, the magnetic nanoparticles were conjugated with methoxy 
poly( ethylene glycol) ( mPEG) to provide high colloidal stability. ( MnxFe1-x)Fe2O4
nanoparticles with dimensions of 10 and 14 nm had saturation magnetization of 66 
and 80 emu/ g, respectively, which were higher than magnetite nanoparticles. After 
all the surface modifications, the saturation magnetization values decreased due to 
nonmagnetic coatings, as expected. In this study, the PEGylated ( MnxFe1-x)Fe2O4@
SiO2 and bare ( MnxFe1-x)Fe2O4@SiO2 nanoparticles were tested for MRI and 
hyperthermia applications. ( MnxFe1-x)Fe2O4@SiO2 nanoparticles possessed the r2
relaxivity value of 175 mM [Fe+Mn] −1 s−1, while PEGylated ( MnxFe1-x)Fe2O4@
SiO2 showed that of 150.3 mM [Fe+Mn] −1 s−1, which were close to the value of 
commercial MRI agents. Similarly, the SAR values of bare ( MnxFe1-x)Fe2O4@SiO2
and PEGylated ( MnxFe1-x)Fe2O4@SiO2 nanoparticles were calculated as 1635 and 
1346 Wg−1 ( at 41.98 KA m−1 alternating magnetic field), respectively. PEGylated 
(MnxFe1-x)Fe2O4@SiO2 nanoparticles did not cause significant cytotoxicity on 
NIH/ 3T3 cell lines in the 2 to 200 μg mL−1 concentration range. Moreover, the 
fluorescence signal was observed from NIH/ 3T3 cell labeled with PEGylated 
(MnxFe1-x)Fe2O4@SiO2 nanoparticles, which indicated that these nanoparticles pass 
through the cell membrane. As a result, the obtained results revealed that the devel￾oped magnetic nanoplatform could be suitable for multi- purpose biomedical appli￾cations ( Sheng et al. 2018).82 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
There are also magnetic nanoparticles in clinical trials for MRI applications, which 
are still being studied. For example, F erumoxtran- 10 is a contrast agent formed by 
coating superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ( 10– 20 nm) with dextran T- 10. 
This contrast agent has attracted attention, especially in Europe, and its clinical stud￾ies are continuing to improve the images of lymph mode in some cancer types, such 
as bladder and prostate cancer. Unfortunately, it has not yet been approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) ( Huang et al. 2022; Leenders 2003). Another 
type of magnetic nanoparticle with ongoing clinical trials in the MRI is the s iloxane- 
 coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle ( AMI- 121). AMI- 121 consists of a 
bulk structure with a total size of 300 nm, composed of iron oxide nanoparticles with 
dimensions of approximately 10 nm. The siloxane coating on the iron oxide acts as 
a protective agent in case of uptake by the gastrointestinal tract ( Huang et al. 2022; 
Min et al. 2015).
The magnetic particle imaging ( MPI) technique has received increasing attention 
in recent years owing to no background signal, high tissue penetration depth, and no 
need for ionizing radiation ( Bulte 2019). Compared to the signal for MRI, the signal 
of MPI directly depends on the magnetic moment of magnetic nanoparticles, so it 
is more sensitive. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are utilized as tracer 
material in the MPI because of their superior magnetic properties and widespread 
use in clinical applications. The basis of MPI technique is based on the interaction of 
superparamagnetic nanoparticles with an externally applied magnetic field. When a 
strong magnetic field is applied to superparamagnetic nanoparticles, they are mag￾netized and reach the saturation point. There is no linear relationship between the 
strength of the magnetic field and the magnetization of superparamagnetic nanopar￾ticles, but the mathematical model defines this relationship. The slope of the curve 
obtained from the relationship describes a narrow magnetic field intensity range, the 
oscillation of which can cause a sudden and large magnetization shift of superpara￾magnetic nanoparticles. The MPI signal consists of the shift of magnetization of 
nanoparticles when exposed to an oscillating magnetic field ( Bakenecker et al. 2018; 
Meola et al. 2019). MPI has been applied to various medical applications such as 
cancer imaging, cardiovascular imaging, neuroimaging, and cell tracking ( Billings 
et al. 2021). Irfan et al. prepared the citric acid and polyacrylic acid- coated NiFe2O4
nanoparticles (NiFe2O4@CA and NiFe2O4@PAA, respectively) as a potential tracer 
agent for MPI applications. Hydrodynamic sizes of NiFe2O4@CA and NiFe2O4@
PAA nanoparticles were calculated as 93 and 70 nm with dynamic light scattering 
( DLS). The MPI performance of synthesized nanoparticles was examined via mag￾netic particle spectroscopy ( MPS) at 9.9 kHz with a 15 mT excitation field. NiFe2O4@
PAA sample exhibited a relaxation time of 3.10 µs and resolution of 7.75 mT, which 
were superior to commercial samples such as Vivotrax and Perimag. The developed 
nanoparticles could have the potential as MPI tracer agents ( Irfan et al. 2021).
A different study for MPI tracer was carried out by Horwat et al. In this study, 
poloxamer Pluronics F127 ( PF127) was modified to provide water- dispersibility for 
magnetic particles prepared via thermal composition. After further modification 
( PF127DA: acrylate groups modified PF127), the surfaces of the nanoparticles were 
also functionalized poly( glycidol) s ( PG- SH) to improve the performance of MPI. The 
MPI performance of PF127 and PF127DAPG modified magnetic nanoparticles was Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications 83
examined via MPS. As shown in Figure 4.5a and b, it was observed that the decay of 
the spectra of higher harmonics decreased with increasing temperature, which could 
be due to the change in the viscosity of the medium depending on the temperature. 
Although both measurements included the same amount of magnetic nanoparticles, 
PF127DAPG modified magnetic nanoparticles were markedly different, with better 
FIGURE  4.5 Temperature- dependent MPS performances of PF127 ( a) and PF127DAPG 
( b) modified magnetic nanoparticles, higher response of samples in MPS measurement at 
25°C ( c), signal- to- noise ratio ( SNR) ( d), and MPI images ( e) of samples. ( Horvat et al. 2020), 
Wiley-VCH.84 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
performance (Figure  4.5c), and exhibited an excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
( Figure 4.5d). In addition, higher SNR in higher spatial resolution was obtained for 
 PF127DAPG- modified magnetic nanoparticles using 1.3 μg of iron in MPI images. 
The same ratio was obtained for the PF127 modified sample using 5.3 μg of iron 
( Figure 4.5e). Magnetic nanoparticles modified with only PF127 showed cytotoxic￾ity because of their high amphiphilic nature, causing the solubilization of the lipids 
from the cell membrane, whereas when functionalized with biocompatible PG, cyto￾toxicity decreased. The results obtained from this study indicated that these modi￾fied magnetic nanoparticles could be used in the future for diagnostics ( Horvat et al.
2020).
The MPI technique can also be used with other imaging techniques. For instance, 
Lemaster et al. developed 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′, 3′-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine
iodide (DiR) labeled and a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based iron oxide 
nanobubbles for ultrasound imaging, photoacoustic imaging, and MPI. MPI density 
of functional nanoparticles was 20 times higher in stem cell imaging compared to 
control experiments. Similarly, ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging displayed a 
3. 8- and 10. 2- fold increase in imaging intensity after injection ( Lemaster et al. 2018).
Another imaging technique commonly used in the medical field is computed 
tomography ( CT), which reflects anatomy, tissues, and functions in high resolution 
and allows the reconstruction of images. The basic principle of CT is based on the 
differences in the attenuation of the X- rays sent depending on the weight and density 
of the tissues. However, some low- density and soft tissues are difficult to visualize, 
and contrast agents possessing high atomic numbers are used to improve the tissues’ 
contrast. The most common CT agents are compounds including iodine, barium, 
gold, bismuth, ytterbium, and gadolinium ( Molkenova et al. 2022). The studies show 
that magnetic nanoparticles are mainly used for combining CT with other imag￾ing techniques such as MRI and positron emission tomography ( PET) or treatment 
methods such as drug delivery and hyperthermia rather than alone CT application 
(Chouhan et al. 2021; Thomas et al. 2013). For example, Naha et al. presented the 
 dextran- coated bismuth- iron oxide nanohybrid contrast agents for MRI and CT. In 
this study, dextran- coated iron oxide nanoparticles containing changing amounts of 
bismuth were synthesized via the coprecipitation method and characterized by vari￾ous analytical techniques. It was observed that the magnetic properties and transverse 
relaxivities (T2) decreased the amount of bismuth in the iron oxide nanoparticles, 
which could be the integration of bismuth into the iron oxide structure. CT images of 
agents containing different amounts of bismuth at the same iron concentration ( 9.37 
mg ml−1) were taken at 140 kV, and X- ray attenuation was also measured using vari￾ous X- ray tube voltages. Iron oxide formulations without bismuth possessed a weak 
 X- ray attenuation; this value was only around 50 HU ( Hounsfield unit) depending 
on applying X- ray voltage. However, there was a proportional increase in the X- ray 
attenuation with the increase in the amount of bismuth. The strongest attenuation was 
obtained in the Bi- 30 sample using an 80 X - ray tube voltage of 80 kV. As a result, 
dextran-coated bismuth-iron oxide nanoparticles could be used as T2-weighted MR 
and CT agents due to their properties ( Naha et al. 2014).
Yang et  al. developed a single multi- functional nanocomposite for multimodal 
imaging and therapy applications. WS2 nanosheets were modified with iron oxide Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications 85
nanoparticles (WS2-O I) coated with mesoporous SiO2 and PEG; then DOX as an anti￾cancer drug was loaded into the composite structure to prepare the m ulti- functional 
nanocomposite (WS2-IO@MS-PEG/DOX). In this nanocomposite, WS2 nanosheets 
have NIR and X-r ay absorbance properties so that they can be used in photothermal 
therapy and CT imaging applications. Additionally, iron oxide nanoparticles are T2 
contrast agents in MRI, and mesoporous SiO2 provides the space for drug transport. 
HU values of WS2-IO@MS-PEG/DOX solutions increased with increasing concen￾trations for CT images, and the slope obtained from the HU values versus concen￾trations was calculated as 31.9 Lg−1. Moreover, In vivo CT imaging was performed 
using 4T1 tumor- bearing Balb/ c mice, and a noticeable contrast difference was 
seen similar to other imaging techniques. WS2-IO@MS-PEG/DOX nanocomposite
showed a synergistic effect by combining imaging and treatment methods on a single 
platform when other detailed results were examined ( Yang et al. 2015).
4.3.3 separation and deteCtion appliCations
The most significant challenges in medicine are the extraordinarily rapid and accu￾rate separation and determination of nucleic acids, proteins, and cells in biological 
samples. In particular, various materials have been developed that can separate and 
detect biomolecules and cells accurately and precisely. These materials make detect￾ing diseases early or providing valuable information about biological properties pos￾sible. Techniques using magnetic nanomaterials offer many advantages compared 
to other techniques ( Haun et al. 2010). Magnetic isolation is of great interest in bio￾medical studies because it allows selective and sensitive capture of target molecules. 
Compared to traditional chromatographic methods, magnetic separation, purifica￾tion, or detection method provides faster and more efficient separation of target mol￾ecules by the external magnetic field and affinity interaction ( Yildiz 2016).
Nucleic acids are one of life’s fundamental substances and have essential biologi￾cal functions. They store, copy and transmit genetic information, so separation and 
detection of nucleic acids play a significant role in diagnosing and treating various 
diseases. Typically, the separation of nucleic acid from biosamples requires complex 
and multi- step procedures ( Garner 2000). For example, the polymerase chain reaction 
( PCR) method is generally used for nucleic acid detection, which is time- consuming 
and expensive. In this respect, it is thought that it would be appropriate to use mag￾netic nanoparticles for the fast and economic separation and detection of nucleic acids 
(Tang et al. 2020). For instance, Zandieh et al. designed the nucleic acids ( spherical 
“SNA” and linear “SH-DNA” functionalized Fe3O4@PDA nanoparticles for use in 
DNA extraction and detection. DNA extraction with “ SNA” functionalized Fe3O4@
PDA (Fe3O4@PDA@SNA) was found to be five times faster than with “ SH- DNA” 
functionalized Fe3O4@PDA (Fe3O4@PDA@ SH- DNA) because of the more appro￾priate conformation of DNA strands in SNA. About 80% of the isolated DNA with 
Fe3O4@PDA@SNA probe could be recovered at weak ionic strength. The same probe 
was employed as DNA sensing after incubation with 12- mer FAM- cDNA ( reporter 
DNA) to form a nanoflare probe. The limit of detection ( LOD) values of Fe3O4@
PDA@SNA and Fe3O4@PDA@ SH- DNA probes were determined to be 4.4 and 10.7 
nM, respectively, and the probe signal of Fe3O4@PDA@SNA was stronger at the 
 86 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
same target concentration. The authors consider that SNA functionalization may be 
an essential method in bioanalytical chemistry because of the positive results obtained 
in the study ( Zandieh and Liu 2021). Tiwari et al. synthesized Fe3O4@silica@chitosan 
nanoparticles for magnetic separation of DNA. Various experimental parameters such 
as pH, temperature, and time were optimized for the adsorption of DNA on functional 
magnetic nanoparticles. The maximum DNA absorption was 50 µg at pH 5, and DNA 
binding efficiency was 88% at the same pH. The maximum elution efficiency of DNA 
was 98% at pH 8.5, and the amount of desorbed DNA remained constant above pH 
8.5. Additionally, it was determined that the DNA isolation was 95% in the 1 0- minute 
time and 55% even after using five cycles. The results indicated that Fe3O4@silica@
chitosan nanoparticles had superior advantages such as high adsorption  & elution 
capacity and selectivity compared to other methods ( Tiwari et al. 2015).
Wang et al. prepared the silica- coated magnetic nanoparticles ( Fe3O4@SiO2) to 
simultaneously extract DNA and RNA from hepatocellular carcinoma ( Hep G2). 
Average DNA and RNA isolation yields were calculated as 9.7 and 14.7 µg per 1 mL 
Hep G2 cell, respectively. This method allows for the automatic isolation of nucleic 
acids ( Wang et al. 2017). In the literature, there are several studies using functional 
magnetic nanoparticles for the separation and detection of nucleic acids ( Fei et al.
2022; Tavallaie et al. 2018; Yajima et al. 2022).
The isolation, separation, and detection of proteins using functional nanoparti￾cles also attract great attention in biomedical fields ( Eivazzadeh- Keihan et al. 2021; 
Safarik and Safarikova 2004). For example, Protein A has an affinity for binding to 
immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, and C - reactive protein, so it can be helpful in detecting 
target proteins in disease diagnosis. Thanh et al. published a study on the immobi￾lization of protein A to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for biomedical 
applications. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles synthesized by the copre￾cipitation method with a size of 10 and 30 nm were modified with SiO2, NH2, and 
CHO groups using TEOS, APTES, and glutaraldehyde ( GA), respectively. The final 
functional sample ( Fe3O4/SiO2/NH2/ CHO), including 10 nm iron oxide nanoparti￾cles, possessed the protein A binding efficiency of 82%. This high binding capacity 
introduces that Fe3O4/SiO2/NH2/ CHO nanoparticles may be used to diagnose some 
fibrinogen-based diseases (Thanh et al. 2019).
For vascular endothelial growth factor 165 ( VEGF165) protein detection, Zhang 
et al. modified the magnetic glassy carbon electrode ( MGCE) with Fe3O4/Fe2O3@
Au nanoparticles as an electrochemical aptasensor ( MGCE/ Fe3O4/Fe2O3@Au). In 
the study, Fe3O4/Fe2O3@Au nanoparticles were utilized to increase the electron 
transfer required for detecting trace amounts of a biological analyte. Moreover, the 
surface of MGCE/ Fe3O4/Fe2O3@Au was functionalized with a thiol- modified DNA 
aptamer to detect the VEGF165 protein and the nonspecific sites on the final product 
(MGCE/Fe3O4/Fe2O3@ Au- DNA) were blocked with the treatment of BSA. The elec￾trochemical aptasensor sensor showed a good linear relationship between 0.01 and 
10 pg mL−1 with R2= 0.9973, and the LOD and the limit of quantitation ( LOQ) were 
calculated to be 0.01 and 0.03 pg mL−1. The electrochemical aptasensor had excellent 
selectivity, stability, and reproducibility, so it is considered an efficient, accurate, and 
 cost- effective sensor for the early detection of some diseases based on the VEGF165
protein ( Zhang et al. 2022).Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications 87
As another example of protein separation, Pham et  al. first synthesized g old- 
 containing iron oxide nanoparticles with a size of 15 to 40 nm for magnetic sepa￾ration of protein immunoglobulin G ( IgG). In this study, the magnetic separation 
process was carried out using a 3000 G magnet, and protein IgG was attached to the 
gold surface with a 35% yield by electrostatic interaction. Since protein lgG in differ￾ent animals can bind effectively to protein A, magnetic nanoparticles presenting lgG 
can act as affinity probes to target bacteria ( Pham et al. 2008). Ma et al. prepared Ti4+
modified, and PDA- coated iron oxide nanoparticles ( Ti4+-PDA@Fe3O4) to identify 
and detect phosphorylated proteins. Reversible protein phosphorylation is critical in 
many biological processes such as cell division and cellular metabolism. It is known 
that abnormal phosphorylation of proteins is associated with many diseases, and 
their identification and determination are necessary for disease diagnosis. Ti4+ ions 
on the surface of Ti4+-PDA@Fe3O4 nanoparticles can bind to phosphate groups in 
phosphorylated proteins. Therefore, Ti4+-PDA@Fe3O4 nanoparticles showed highly 
effective and selective adsorption for phosphorylated proteins ( 1273.9 mg g−1 for 𝛽- 
 Cas) depending on the immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography ( IMAC) ( Ma 
and Jia 2016).
In another study related to protein detection, poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co￾maleic acid) ( PSS- MA) coated gold magnetic ( GoldMag) nanoparticles forming 
Fe3O4, and Au nanoparticles were prepared by Zhang et al. for the detection of D- 
 dimer, which are degradation product of fibrin. Detecting D- dimer in the blood is 
essential to identify thromboembolic events and myocardial infarction. Before detec￾tion, the surface of P SS- MA modified GoldMag was conjugated with an a nti- D - 
 dimer antibody. The detection range of D- dimer was estimated between 0.3 and 6 μg 
mL−1 ( Zhang et al. 2017).
As with biomolecules, separating and detecting biological cells is critical in vari￾ous fields, including diagnosis, therapy, and cell biology ( Ma et al. 2019). Currently, 
methods based on different properties such as size, density, electric, magnetic, and 
adhesive have been developed to separate and identify cells. However, cells pos￾sessing similar sizes and shapes cannot be effectively separated considering these 
features ( Plouffe and Murthy 2014; Plouffe et al. 2014). On the other hand, func￾tional magnetic nanoparticles can be utilized in cell isolation after modification with 
specific molecules. For instance, Saei et  al. demonstrated that the human epithe￾lial growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2+) breast cancer cells were effectively separated 
using an antibody ( Ab)- modified iron oxide nanoparticles under a magnetic field. 
The anti-HER2 Ab was attached to the surface of nanoparticles with 1-ethyl-3-(3-
dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide crosslinkers. Targeting
cell separation efficiencies of A b- modified iron oxide nanoparticles were calculated 
to be 94.5% ± 0.8% for BT474 cells, which are HER2+, and 70.6% ± 0.4% for a mix￾ture of BT474 and MCF7 cells ( HER2- ). A b- modified iron oxide nanoparticles may 
be promising for the early and rapid detection of cancer cells ( Saei et al. 2020). In 
another study, anti- CD3 monoclonal antibody ( mAb) conjugated Fe3O4@Au, pre￾sented by Cui et al. was utilized to separate CD3+ T cells from the whole splenocytes. 
Anti-CD3 mAb conjugated Fe3O4@Au separated CD3+ T cells from the whole sple￾nocytes with high efficiency ( 98.4%) ( Cui et al. 2011). Lu et al. prepared PEI- coated 
Fe3O4 nanoparticles to separate and enrich lung cancer cells from sputum samples. 
 88 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
The analysis demonstrated that the percentage of positive cells in sputum samples 
increased from 6.3% to 38.5% after treatment with the PEI- coated Fe3O4 ( Lu et al.
2014). In another study performed by Vajhadin et al., after HER2- positive cells were 
isolated with high efficiency using CoFe2O4@ Ag- HB5 aptamer, they were detected 
with an MXene- based cytosensor based on the metallic conductivity ( with 75 minutes 
total analysis time). Electrochemical detection of cells is mainly based on the interac￾tion between SK-BR-3 cells captured with CoFe2O4@Ag-HB5 and modified MXene 
nanolayers. This hybrid system can be used not only for detecting cancer cells but 
also for drug delivery ( Vajhadin et al. 2022). Digehsaraei et al. ( 2021) developed a 
fluorescence immunosensor consisting of graphene quantum nanoparticles ( GQNPs) 
and magnetic nanoparticles ( MNPs) for or detection of HER2- positive breast cancer 
cells ( Figure 4.6a). Firstly, s ilica- coated MNPs were functionalized with an amino 
group via APTES, and then, Herceptin was bonded to the surface of nanoparticles 
to provide the separation of cancer cells. Similarly, GQNPs were conjugated with 
FIGURE 4.6 ( a) Schematic descriptions of the conjugation of Herceptin to MNPs ( I) and 
GQNPs ( II), incubation of M NPs- Herceptin and G QNPs- Herceptin structures with breast 
cancer cells, and separation from the medium ( III) and detection of breast cancer cells by an 
inverted fluorescence microscope ( IV). ( b) SEM ( I), visible ( II), and fluorescence ( III) images

Herceptin to form a sandwich structure, which creates a signal for the detection of 
cancer cells. After incubation of MNPs- Herceptin and GQNPs- Herceptin structures 
with breast cancer cells, the sandwich structure forming M NPs- Herceptin- Breast 
cancer cell- Herceptin- GQNPs was separated from the medium via an external 
magnet and detected by an inverted fluorescence microscope. It was confirmed that 
Herceptin was successfully attached to the surfaces of MNPs and GQNPs in the dif￾ferent imaging methods obtained as shown in Figure 4.6b. The results revealed that 
the HER2 receptor could be detected selectively and with a detection limit of 1 cell 
mL−1.

5.1 INTRODUCTION
Nanotechnology is currently most suitable in biomedical applications, due to recent 
developments in our understanding of materials and the addition of new materials 
that may be safely included for medical diagnosis and therapies ( Patra et al. 2018). 
Owing to their superior physical, chemical, and, biological properties, nanoparticles 
provide a multitude of advantages for numerous bioapplications (Y etisgin et al. 2020). 
Synthesis and functionalization processes influence the compositions ( polymers, 
peptides, metals, and lipids) and morphologies (fl owers, rods, pyramids, and spheres) 
of nanoparticles ( Jeevanandam et al. 2018).
Over the past 10 years, magnetic nanoparticles ( MNPs) have been recognized 
as potentially useful tools in the field of nanomedicine due to their superior physi￾cochemical qualities. These qualities include ease of surface modification, super￾paramagnetism, excellent colloidal stability, good relaxation performance, and 
outstanding biocompatibility in in vivo environment (D arroudi et al. 2021).
MNPs are notable for their versatility in a variety of biomedical applications, 
including hyperthermia, medication administration, cell isolation magnetic reso￾nance imaging ( MRI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS) ( Wu et  al. 
2019). Several synthetic approaches, including microemulsion, coprecipitation, h igh- 
 temperature decomposition, and solvothermal procedures, have been developed and 
employed to manufacture shape- and size-controlled MNPs. High-quality MNPs, 
on the other hand, are commonly produced utilizing organic phases and completed 
with hydrophobic surface ligands, limiting their colloidal stability in physiological 
fluids and limiting their biological applications (K yeong et al. 2021). To address these 
challenges with MNP in vivo application, the surface of MNPs is routinely altered by 
capping individual layers to boost their stability and biocompatibility, inhibit nonspe￾cific protein absorption, and lengthen the time that they circulate in the circulation. 
To achieve precise surface functionalization ( e.g., quantum dot. silica, gold), a vari￾ety of design components, including organic ligands (s uch as biomacromolecules, 
synthetic polymers, and small molecules), organic– inorganic hybrid NPs ( such as 
 metal-o rganic frameworks [MOFs]), organic– inorganic NPs, and inorganic NPs, can 
be used (A li et al. 2021). Organic ligands, for example, are extremely beneficial in a 
variety of biological and therapeutic applications. MNPs may have the appropriate 
size, controllable structure, surface charge, and programmable responses to tumor 
microenvironments ( such as pH, redox, and ROS) due to their properties ( Kankala 
et al. 2022). MNPs are sometimes contained in polyethylene glycol (P EG) and its 
derivatives ( RES) for enhanced stability and biocompatibility, as well as to avoid 
rapid clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (C ole et al. 2011). Charge- switchable Induction of Physicochemical Effects 99
FIGURE 5.1 Schematic illustration of magnetic nanoparticle’s ( MNP) special features, syn￾thesis, functionalization, and biomedical applications.
polymers can be used with MNPs to activate their surface charge switch, convert￾ing it from a negative to a positive charge, hence extending circulation duration and 
boosting cellular absorption ( Ooi et al. 2020). To achieve tumor targeting, folic acid 
(FA), antibodies, Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides, hyaluronic acid (HA), and other 
organic target ligands can be decorated onto the surfaces of MNPs (R izwanullah 
et al. 2021). These ligands have the ability to connect with the receptors produced 
by tumor cells at the target sites. Several tumor m icroenvironment- responsive poly￾mers have also been developed and widely employed to enhance MNP s elf- assembly 
into smart nanocarriers for drug administration, controlled release, and increased 
MR contrast in diseased areas (R izwanullah et al. 2021). Various strategies, such 
as ligand substitution, s elf- assembly, and i n- situ synthesis, have been described to 
change the surface of MNPs. These approaches enable the integration of the func￾tions and components of organic ligands with MNPs, and they offer a promising 
method of changing the properties of MNPs for use in biomedical applications (B aki 
et al. 2021).
This chapter presents special features, synthesis, surface engineering 
(f unctionalization), and biomedical applications ( bioimaging, drug delivery, chemo￾therapy, magnetic hyperthermia, biosensors, and regenerative medicine) of MNPs 
(Figure 5.1).
5.2 S PECIAL FEATURES OF MNPs
MNP characteristics are distinct from general magnetic materials and magnetic 
properties, which are only associated with the physical length for the nanoscale in 
the 1– 100 nm orders of magnitude. Alternatively, magnetic body size and physical 
length characteristics show anomalous magnetic and electrical properties. These 
characteristics vary quite a bit from one MNP class to the next. The chemical stabil￾ity of magnetic nanoparticles, large specific surface areas of magnetic nanoparticles, 
high loading capacities, low intraparticle concentrations, and superparamagnetism 100 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
are all key aspects of magnetic nanoparticles. When the size is less than the req￾uisite critical dimensions, a phenomenon known as superparamagnetism can take 
place ( Kolhatkar et al. 2013). It is important to note that the critical diameter might 
change depending on the substance. For instance, the critical diameter of Fe3O4 is 
35 nm ( Lim et al. 2011). Compared to the saturation magnetization values for para￾magnetic materials, superparamagnetic nanoparticles are orders of magnitude higher 
( Faraudo et al. 2010). In addition, they have a high level of resistance to an external 
field ( Furlani 2010). Additionally, the orientations of the magnetic moment vectors 
begin to relax. They have very little attraction to one another when no magnetic field 
is present, which lessens the likelihood that particles will gather together ( Furlani 
2010; Sahoo et al. 2005).
5.2.1 Q uantuM size effeCt
Material level spacing and atomic number N are inversely related. The number of 
atoms within the particles is constrained when the particle size is tiny. Close to 
the fermi level, the electrical energy levels of nanometals transition from continu￾ous to discrete. The most and least occupied molecular orbitals are discontinuous 
in nanoscale semiconductor particle energy gap expansion. When the energy gap 
separation is greater than the magnetic, thermal, photonic, electrostatic, and other 
energy characteristics of the material, the nanoparticle and macroscopic physical 
properties will be separate. Conductive metal, for example, can become an insulator 
in the presence of ultrafine particles. The macroscopic quantum size effect affects 
the electron’s magnetic moment and particle size, affecting the amount of anomalous 
heat generated.
5.2.2 surfaCe effeCts
Due to nanomaterials composition and small particle size, the atomic number of a 
particle’s surface corresponds to that of a nanoparticle’s surface. The geometric sur￾face of particle number grows as particle size decreases. Due to the particle’s huge 
surface area and surface energy, the particle’s surface atoms are highly active, inter￾act swiftly with the surrounding gas, and readily absorb the gas. Unit mass paired 
with an increase in particle surface area and an increase in surface atomic number 
results in a significant deficiency in atomic coordination number. This phenomenon 
is known as a nanoscale material surface effect. People can use nanoparticles in a 
variety of ways to make better use of materials and find new applications for them 
( Batlle et al. 2002). When the ratio of surface atoms to bulk atoms is high, the surface 
spins contribute significantly to the nanoparticles’ magnetic characteristics. Surface 
effects have a significant impact on the performance of magnetic nanoparticles.
5.2.3 sMall size effeCt
The original crystal periodic boundary conditions are destroyed because the mag￾netic nanoparticles are so small that they can be affected by the magnetic exchange 
of wavelength, length, conduction electrons DE Broglie wavelength, the width of the Induction of Physicochemical Effects 101
magnetic domain wall, more physical characteristic length, or superconducting state 
coherence length. Some examples of the new effects are the change from magnetic 
order to magnetic disorder and the change in the magnetic coercive force.
5.3 SYNTHESIS OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
For the multistep synthesis of MNPs, meticulous attention to detail is required to 
produce the desired results ( Majidi et al. 2016). Developing MNPs can be done in 
a variety of different methods. Building MNPs can be approached from either the 
“top-down” or the “bottom-up” perspective (Mehta 2017). The “top-down” method
involves using high- energy ball milling to reduce the size of magnetic samples to 
the requisite nanoscale dimensions. This method has the advantage of enabling the 
manufacture of a large number of particles using only a single batch of ingredients. 
A disadvantage is that it does not control particle size and form, which is neces￾sary for many biological applications ( Öztürk et al. 2022). Starting with either a 
ferrous (Fe2+) or ferric ( Fe3+) ion salt would be the first step in the “ bottom- up” 
strategy. The salt is then subjected to its unique chemical process to nucleate and 
expedite seeded growth to develop particles to their appropriate hydrodynamic 
sizes ( Mosayebi et al. 2017). This is done to create particles with the necessary 
hydrodynamic sizes. In the research that has been done, numerous “ bottom- up” 
solutions have been mentioned. The procedures of hydrothermal synthesis, copre￾cipitation, polyol synthesis, and thermal breakdown ( Table 5.1) are the ones that 
have been mentioned in the scientific literature the most frequently ( Anik et al. 
2021). Other techniques include the production of micelles, microemulsions, sol- 
 gel, solvothermal processes, sonochemical processes, flow injection techniques, 
physical vapor deposition, and microwave- assisted processes. Other techniques 
include flow injection techniques, flow injection techniques, flow injection tech￾niques, and flow injection techniques. Some processes that can be used include 
chemical vapor deposition, laser pyrolysis, electrodeposition, carbon ARC, and 
combustion ( Akbarzadeh et al. 2012a and 2012b).

5.4 FUNCTIONALIZATION OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
MNPs must be functionalized. It permits biomedical MNP use ( Table 5.2). Without 
functionalization, MNPs would be unstable in acidic conditions and leach, reduc￾ing their lifespan and reusability ( Mollarasouli et al. 2021). Functionalizing MNPs 
improves their solubility, biocompatibility, surface catalytic activity, agglomeration, 
physiochemical, and mechanical properties ( Zhu et al. 2018). MNP functionaliza￾tion prevents oxidation. Iron, nickel, and cobalt, as well as their alloys, are sensi￾tive to oxygen ( Schladt et al. 2011). Oxidation can change maghemite ( Fe2O3) and 
magnetite’s magnetic properties ( Laurent et al. 2008). As illustrated in Figure 5.2, 
the stability of colloids may be confirmed so that oxidation, agglomeration, and 
sedimentation can be avoided by modifying the surface of nanoparticles with 
antibodies, peptides, genes, ligands, and drugs to develop hybrid multifunctional 
nanomaterials.
 In- situ and post- synthesis functionalization is possible. In contrast to the in- situ 
procedure, post- synthesis functionalizes MNPs following synthesis, ligand addition, 
ligand exchange, and encapsulation ( Bohara et al. 2016). Due to the range of coating 
agents, encapsulation is most often used. Organic materials like polymers and sur￾factants can be encapsulated, as can inorganic materials like carbon, silica, metal, 
and metal oxides. Functionalizing polymers is a common biomedical procedure, 
especially in nanomedicine. Silica is a common inorganic encapsulating covering. 
Silica encapsulating techniques include the Stöber method, aerosol pyrolysis, micro￾emulsion, and sodium silicate. Functionalized MNPs have been used for a number of 
biological applications, including drug delivery ( Zhu et al. 2018; Uribe Madrid et al. 
2015). Carbon, metals, and metal oxides have limited biological applications ( Zhu 
et al. 2018).
5.5 APPLICATIONS OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
5.5.1 Mnps in drug forMulation for drug delivery
Therapeutic components are either loosely bound to MNPs or encased in compos￾ites of MNPs and polymers in magnetic drug delivery systems. Targeted medica￾tion delivery is significant because, as illustrated in F igure 5.3, it operates in a wide 
range of environmental conditions, including ultrasound, light, temperature, and 
magnetic fields to deliver pharmaceuticals directly to the site of the disease in an 
external magnetic field associated with na no- sized iron oxide ( Fe3O4) particles ( Chen 
et al. 2010). They are then placed inside a porous silica shell that has been stabilized 
with polyethylene glycol ( Fe3O4-DOX/pSiO2- PEG). The drug molecule is protected 
within the composite carrier by a thin layer of porous silica gel that functions as a 
barrier to escape the active ingredient, dioxane ( DOX). The polymer Eudragit coats 
medications for intestinal absorption since its pH is sensitive. A possible application 
is transporting medicines to different sites ( Linares et al. 2019).
In a petri dish containing ethanol, superparamagnetic nanoparticles coated with

the tumor’s temperature to rise to 43°C (J ordan et al. 2006). In an AMF, Zhao et al. 
observed that administering an IONP solution to a mouse with tumors in its head 
and neck resulted in no damage to healthy cells ( Zhao et al. 2012). With the help 
of the biocompatible polymer PEG, the mixture was able to escape the reticuloen￾dothelial system, allowing for extended observation. The DOX was soaked up by 
FIGURE  5.2 Surface stabilization of MNPs by peptides, antibodies, ligands, genes, and 
drugs for the fabrication of multifunctional MNPs for theranostic applications.Induction of Physicochemical Effects 107
the MNS and incorporated into the hydrogel. When RF fields are applied to MNS, 
the medicine is released twice as quickly since the drug is activated by heat. More 
than 80% of the cells were killed in the RF field, compared to 40% when there was 
no RF field when using a hydrogel/ MNS composite loaded with DOX to deliver 
the medication locally to HeLa cell lines in a test tube. The antimicrobial cipro￾floxacin and metal nanoparticles ( MNPs) were rapidly liberated from PCL micro￾spheres when they were magnetically stimulated. Using a single emulsion procedure, 
researchers developed a nanocarrier of magnetite nanoparticles loaded with DOX 
and encased in a biocompatible PLGA shell. Intravenous medications with a con￾trolled release. Fe3O4 nanoparticles and DOX combined to create microbubbles 
with broad diagnostic potential ( Nandwana et  al. 2015; Sirivisoot et  al. 2015; Jia 
et al. 2012). Anticancer theranostic agents were created by encapsulating paclitaxel 
and SPIONs in PLGA nanoparticles. A total of magnetite nanoparticles contain￾ing DOX were created using a d ouble- emulsion method and PLGA/ PEG ( Schleich 
et al. 2013). Nanoparticles made of polymers and drugs are employed for sustained 
release. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-encapsulated MNPs were modified with biocompati￾ble PCLPEGPCL for in vivo and in vitro research ( Asadi et al. 2018). With the help of 
a modified double- emulsion technique, oleic acid- coated superparamagnetic magne￾tite nanoparticles are encapsulated in PLGA nanospheres of the same size ( Mosafer 
et al. 2017). Magnetite nanoparticles ( MNPs) were coated with PEGylated curcumin 
to create MNP@ PEG- Cur composites. Nanoparticles release medicine at varying 
rates depending on the pH of the surrounding environment, with a greater proportion 
being released in an acidic environment ( pH = 5.4). The hemolysis and cell survival 
tests performed at a pH of 7.4 demonstrated that MNP@ PEG- Cur was biocompat￾ible ( Ayubi et al. 2019). Methotrexate was conjugated to iron oxide MNPs with an 
arginine cap to provide a novel drug delivery system. In vitro studies have shown that 
 HFF- 2 MCF- 7, and 4T1 cells resist nanoparticles ( Attari et al. 2019). Magnetic Fe3O4
nanoparticles were held together with chitosan and imatinib to create a medication 
delivery system. The pH- sensitive Fe3O4@CS produced imatinib, which inhibited the 
growth of MCF- 7 breast cancer cells. It’s more efficient than standard chemotherapy 
( Karimi Ghezeli et al. 2019). IONPs coated in silica delivered dopamine to malignant 
cells. In a pH 7.4 solution, Fe3O4 nanoparticles loaded with DA and SiO2 released 
significantly more medication than uncoated Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Because of MNPs, 
access to the anticancer medication camptothecin was expanded ( Dey et al. 2019). 
Drugs are combined with MNPs to alter drug release in living organisms, which is 
useful for cancer research. In biotechnology and biology, MNPs are utilized as car￾riers ( Patil et al. 2020).
Researchers have developed cancer drug delivery systems employing probes from 
a wide variety of disciplines. Some examples of effective and relatively safe nanopar￾ticles include raspberry-shaped gold-coated magnetite nanoparticles and poly( -
lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanocomposite particles. Boosting the magneto- and 
photothermal responses of the final probe by including gold and Fe3O4 nanoparticles 
was achieved. In a phosphate- buffered saline solution at 37°C, the nanocomposite 
particles released 5- FU in a manner that suggested they could be employed in photo￾thermal therapy for DU145 prostate cancer cells ( Keyvan Rad et al. 2019). However, 
whether or not photoresponsive magnetic composites are biodegradable and whether 108 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
or not they represent significant safety issues is still a matter of discussion ( Linsley 
and Wu 2017). Several naturally occurring chromophores, including o xy- and deoxy￾hemoglobin, lipids, and water can absorb ultraviolet light. This suggests that the 
maximum penetration depth of UV radiation into tissues is less than 10 mm. It’s 
possible that the sun’s rays, when exposed for extended periods, could cause harm. 
Thus, mucosal surfaces like the skin, eyes, and other mucosal organs should be 
avoided while using light- sensitive nanotherapeutics ( Sahle et  al. 2018). The new 
silica-coated iron oxide and polyaniline nanocomposites (Si-MNPs/PANI) have bio￾medical uses and the ability to respond to dual stimulation. The nanocomposites 
 Si- MNPs/ PANI reacted to both magnetic and electrical fields. Their cytocompatibil￾ity and hemocompatibility further support these composites’ potential for usage in 
dose-controlled drug delivery in vitro. Because of the risk of harming healthy tissue 
during deep tissue penetration, electrical stimulation has not been widely employed 
in medicine despite being simple and inexpensive to implement ( attenuation of a 
stimulus) (Lalegül-Ülker et al. 2021).
5.5.2 Mnps for CheMotherapy
Chemotherapy is cytostatic and cytotoxic but cannot target cells. It’s used to treat 
cancer and kill tumor cells. MNPs can be focused on after internalization. These 
therapeutic chemicals were released from nanoparticles into the cell’s cytoplasm. The 
therapeutic molecule is made by combining chemotherapeutic pharmaceutical drugs 
with MNPs, which are delivered intravenously beneath an external magnetic field 
( Patra et al. 2018). First- stage chemotherapy involves releasing a chemical to damage 
cancer cell structure. Magnetic fields promote MNP biodistribution for safe drug 
delivery to the microenvironment. The use of medicines at low enough concentra￾tions is made feasible by MNPs, which decreases the negative effects of drugs. These 
medicinal chemicals improve intracellular penetration, drug circulation duration, 
and hydrophobic solubility over standard drugs. Controlled drug delivery systems 
reduce nonspecific absorption, are more efficient, offer greater targeting capabilities, 
and regulate drug release ( parenteral, transdermal, oral, and pulmonary) ( Kadian 
2018). The generated nanocarrier based on IONPs worked as an actual and efficient 
transport carrier for the medication DOX. It could destroy cancer cells remotely by 
creating heat in an AMF. The LHRH peptide- functionalized PEG- coated nanocar￾rier enhances the medicines’ targeting ability and stability in physiological media 
( Taratula et al. 2013). The IONP- based technology is reliable for treating ovarian 
cancer using a combinatorial strategy ( Figure 5.4).
MCF-7 was supplied using a DOX-loaded magnetic alginate-chitosan micro￾sphere. SPIONs were used to promote the DOX release. MCF- 7 cells were killed 
in vitro by magnetic hyperthermia or chemotherapy. In vivo studies with antican￾cer medicines and treatment indicated the tumor vanished after 12 days ( Xue et al. 
2018). To kill cancer cells, G O- coated Fe3O4 nanospheres containing DOX were 
PEI-functionalized. In vivo and in vitro studies proposed a drug release method 
( DOXGO/ IONP/ PEI) that eliminated tumor cells due to chemotherapeutic effects. 
This system didn’t destroy healthy tissues ( Zhu et al. 2015). DOX is functionalized 
with -Fe2O3 nanoparticles and encapsulated in PLGA microspheres to prevent tumor 
 Induction of Physicochemical Effects 109

growth. MNPs inside the shell caused heat and drug release permeability. Heat 
and chemotherapy improve breast cancer cell (4 T1) apoptosis in vitro (F ang et al. 
2015). MNPs and carmustine were added to the oleosome’s lipid core to treat cancer. 
Magnetic oleosomes release anticancer medicine in a magnetic field ( Cho et al. 2018). 
Localized pancreatic cancer requires thermotherapy and chemotherapy ( PANC- 1 
and BxPC3). Combining MNPs with gemcitabine and nucAnt ( N6L) regulated the 
release of chemotherapeutics in a magnetic field since heat slows cell growth (S anhaji 
et al. 2019). Encasing a chemotherapeutic medication in a magnetic core and coating 
it with a “ Heat Shock Protein Inhibitor” against lung cancer stem cells (C SCs) cre￾ated a silica- coated MNP multifunctional system. These nanoparticles were utilized 
topically for A MF- based chemotherapy and thermotherapy. After 30 minutes, che￾motherapeutic medication and heat therapy killed 98% of lung CSCs in vitro. In in 
vivo trials with lung CSC x enograft- bearing mice, this combination therapy reduced 
tumor development and spread with few side effects ( Liu et al. 2020). A D OX- loaded 
 SPION- based hydrogel displayed regulated drug release and l ong-l asting efficacy. 
This novel hydrogel composition may prevent cancer relapses (G ao et al. 2019).
Fe3O4-c ored nanoparticles in an AMF can release DOX from an alginate shell, 
releasing heat that can be used with chemotherapy. Folate was linked to nanopar￾ticles, allowing the nanocomposite to enter and persist in cancer cells. In vivo proof 
of reciprocal therapy for mouse lung cancer required a folate component (H a et al. 
2019).
5.5.3 b ioiMaging
Important data about the therapeutic cells’ principle, durability, and activity can 
be gleaned through molecular imaging after transplantation (C hang et al. 2016; Ye 
et  al. 2017). Imaging methods can be divided into three categories: radionuclide 
radiation, magnetic resonance imaging (M RI), and light ( optical). To this end, we 
typically employ contrast chemicals to label cells and signal subsequent separa￾tion from the host tissue. However, optical imaging methods are limited by both the 110 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
wavelength of the applied light and the depth to which it may penetrate the human 
body. Radionuclide imaging techniques are the most sensitive in medical practice. 
However, there are still problems, such as the inability to follow cells over time and 
the lack of anatomical knowledge, which put people’s health at risk. Researchers de 
Vries et al. ( 2005) found that MRI might efficiently monitor the progress of therapeu￾tic cells in patients without requiring intrusive treatments. The use of MRI to track 
cells for therapeutic purposes is not without its limitations. So far, we have a frag￾mented grasp of how these transplanted creatures are distributed. The biggest issue is 
that after stem cells have been engrafted, we have no idea what their purpose is sup￾posed to be ( Gao et al. 2013). Using MRI and other sensors, scientists want to develop 
a versatile platform that can reveal spatial and functional details ( Xu et al. 2008).
5.5.4 M agnetiC hypertherMia
Hyperthermia destroys tumor cells by elevating a tumor’s temperature to 41°C to 
45°C ( Somvanshi et al. 2020). When metastatic disease cells have spread throughout 
the body, whole- body hyperthermia is employed ( Patade et al. 2020). Warming a 
tumor is one approach to produce limited hyperthermia. Radiofrequency, ultrasound, 
infrared radiation, microwaves, magnetic t hermo- seeds, etc. produce hyperthermia. 
Traditional hyperthermia therapy causes tissue damage or lacks heat penetration. 
Ferromagnetic or superparamagnetic particles heat tumor tissue in MNPs- based 
hyperthermia therapy. MNPs have some advantages over hyperthermia. Because 
MNPs utilized for hyperthermia are a few nanometers in size, they can easily reach 
tumors after intravenous infusion with the help of a magnetic field, boosting hyper￾thermia’s explicitness. The MNPs distinctive architecture includes explicit malignant 
growth restriction operators targeting tumor tissues. The far- shifting attractive field 
used to heat MNPs kills tumor cells while inflicting minimal damage to healthy 
tissue. Figure 5.5 shows how MNPs are injected near tumors and heated by an AC 
magnetic field to kill cancer cells.
5.5.5 disease therapy
Weak target site capabilities and impaired drug dispersion across bio- barriers are 
common problems with conventional drug administration, leading to reduced phar￾macological activity and an increased risk of side effects ( Kang et  al. 2016; Xie 
et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2016a; Zhou et al. 2014). Drug packaging and transport of 
nanodevices offer potential solutions to these problems. Recent research has focused 
on vector- mediated drug delivery for its potential to increase treatment efficacy and 
stability by affecting pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ( Yang et al. 2014, 
2015, 2016; Xie et al. 2013). Nanocarriers can transport drugs across the body and 
into sick cells more effectively ( Yu et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2016b; 
Song et al. 2014). Increasing the drug’s exposure and lengthening its h alf- life would 
boost its therapeutic efficacy. One of the active d rug- targeting approaches is using 
 stimuli- sensitive carriers, which allows for the targeted delivery of pharmaceuticals 
within the human body. By manipulating the physical features of colloidal systems in 
response to an external stimulus, we can increase the concentration of the medicine Induction of Physicochemical Effects 111
FIGURE 5.5 Schematics of MNPs-ba sed hyperthermia therapy for cancer treatment.
at the site where it is to be administered. Because of their unique magnetic reactivity 
in this setting, MNPs have the potential as stimuli- sensitive drug carriers. Thus, by 
directing such nanodevices to the intended location, medications can be kept there 
for an extended period before being released, greatly minimizing the adverse effects 
of drug use due to nonspecific distribution ( Ibrahim et al. 1983; Kohler et al. 2005). 
Larger particles have stronger sensitivity to magnetic guiding. They are thus more 
typically utilized as MNPs as magnetic targets, but smaller particles have good tis￾sue permeability and are hence the most widely used MNPs as heat emitters (A rias 
2008). Using magnetic nanoparticles to administer targeted magnetic hyperthermia 
( TMH) is a promising new approach to treating tumors in vivo. Due to its substantial 
therapeutic benefits, high level of safety, and lack of adverse effects, the therapy may 
gain a great deal of attention in future clinical research. However, improving the 
therapeutic efficacy of M NPs- based passive or active targeted hyperthermia treat￾ment via intravenous distribution in vivo is a challenge.
5.5.6 tissue engineering and regenerative MediCine
A possible method of reconstructing damaged tissues using tissue engineering. Over 
the past decade, many efforts have been made to utilize SPION’s unique properties 
in regenerative medicine applications, including bone, nerve, cartilage, and tendon 
regeneration ( Liu et al. 2020; Gonçalves et al. 2016). Magnetic nanoparticles have 
been shown to alter cellular biological processes by numerous research organiza￾tions. An intense magnetic field could stimulate the cell cycle and cell proliferation. 
Magnetomechanical contact with cells also allows for morphology, proliferation, and 
differentiation modifications. Tissue engineers have used magnetically actuated cell 112 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
manipulation ( MAM) in four main ways: ( ia) magnetic targeting to guide cells to the 
intended location; ( ii) magnetic seeding of the cells into the scaffold; ( iii) magnetic 
scaffold; and ( iv) magnetic labeling of cells to generate flattened structures ( Zhang 
et al. 2020). Magnetic scaffolds’ distinctive properties have attracted much interest in 
their potential uses. It has been shown that the magnetic field in magnetized scaffolds 
affects several important facets of tissue engineering, including vascularization, the 
induction of appropriate cellular me chano- and e lectro- transduction processes, the 
enhancement of cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, and the forma￾tion of a significant bioactive interface. For bone healing, IONPs were used to create 
PLGA/ PCL scaffolds ( Tao et al. 2020). Using MNPs can enhance the vital bioactive 
 cell- scaffold interaction in tissue engineering. SPION serves as an overlying layer 
to alter the scaffold’s exterior. The study found that IONPs enhanced the osteogenic 
differentiation of adipose- derived stem cells and enhanced the mechanical character￾istics of scaffolds ( Chen et al. 2018). Preosteoblasts’ biological reaction to magnetic 
materials’ physical stimulation has been studied.
A combination of piezoelectric polymers with m agneto- responsive NPs of 
CoFe2O4 creates the required scaffolds. Magnetoactive materials with a trabecular 
bone-like structure provide the mechano- and electro-transduction required to stimu￾late preosteoblast adhesion and proliferation in bone tissue engineering ( Figure 5.6) 
( Fernandes et al. 2019). Three- dimensional ( 3D) magnetic nanocomposite scaffolds 
of poly(- caprolactone) supported by iron- doped hydroxyapatite ( FeHA) NPs, magne￾tized polyethylene glycol ( PEG)- based hydrogels, and chitosan scaffolds loaded with 
SPION plasmid gene microspheres have all been used in studies showing enhanced 
bone regeneration and vascularization. The glycosylated SPIONs- agarose hydrogel 
scaffolds for tissue engineering have been created in various research using MNPs 
( Li et al. 2018; Aliramaji et al. 2017; Zhao et al. 2019; Bin et al. 2020; Lai et al. 2018; 
Díaz et al. 2016). Results for nerve regeneration using magnetic fields and flexible 
scaffolds are encouraging ( Karimi et al. 2021). The introduction of IONPs to nerve 
FIGURE 5.6 Schematic illustration of magnetomechanical and local magnetoelectrical fea￾tures of three- dimensional PVDF/ CFO scaffolds upon the application of magnetic stimuli. 
Reprinted from Fernandes et al. 2019. Copyright 2022 ACS.Induction of Physicochemical Effects 113
scaffolds led to dramatic changes in neurite outgrowth, axonal extension, and signal￾ing pathways that promote neuronal differentiation due to direct interactions between 
SPIONs and proteins ( Karimi et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2020). The usage of a composite 
NGC scaffold containing PCL, melatonin, and SPIONs was found to promote axonal 
development and inhibit inflammation ( Chen et al. 2020). In addition, a nanocom￾posite scaffold made of chitosan- glycerophosphate polymers was shown to stimulate 
nerve regeneration and improve Schwann cell survival in a study conducted by Liu 
et al. ( 2017). Tissue engineers have found many uses for magnetically sensitive smart 
hydrogels, including wound healing and bone, neuron, muscle, and heart repair. The 
results showed that tissue regeneration might be sped up by combining IONPs with 
biomaterials such as chitosan, collagen, polyacrylamide, poly( lactide- coglycolide) 
dextran, agarose, and poly( polyacrylamide) ( Liu et al. 2020).
5.5.7 biosensors
The sensor and MNPs authoritative to the sensor make up the functionalized unit of 
 magneto- resistive sensors used in biosensing applications ( Tu 2013). The magnetic 
fields created by the MNPs that modify the sensor’s magnetic fields cause varia￾tions in electrical flow or opposition within the sensor, which is the basic basis for 
this class of magneto- resistive sensors ( Hasanzadeh et al. 2015). When compared to 
electrochemical, radioactive, or colorimetric methods, sensors based on MNPs have 
shown considerable biomarker recognition and capability focus points, as well as 
high affectability, long- term security, and the potential for equipment downsizing. 
The approach has so found use in a number of fields, including clinical analysis, the 
food industry, and environmental protection. Direct marking and incorrect naming 
are examples of binding methods used by MNPs to stay put on the sensor surface. 
These MNPs disrupt magnetic fields, and magnetic sensors pick up on this. The 
sandwich immunoassay is the gold standard for indirect marking. Antibodies spe￾cific to the target protein are attached to the outside of the device.
5.6 CONCLUSION
Functionalized MNPs have been studied in biomedicine for years. Rapid progress in 
synthesizing MNPs with organic ligands on their surfaces has been made. Organic 
 ligand- mediated MNPs improve stability, solubility, biocompatibility, cancer target￾ing, and cellular absorption.
Magnetic nanoparticles are employed in medicine, imaging, and medication 
delivery in biomedicine. Recent breakthroughs in synthesizing and functionaliz￾ing monodispersed, tunable, and adjustable magnetic particle size and shape have 
helped the scientific community address and resolve various therapeutic magnetic 
particle issues. Magnetic nanoparticles are good for targeted drug delivery due to 
their high surface- to- volume ratio and magnetic characteristics. Magnetic nanocom￾posites, including magnetic dendrimers, magnetic hydrogel, magnetic liposomes, 
etc., helped scientists overcome challenges like premature burst release of loaded 
drugs and enhanced targeting efficacy. Magnetic h yperthermia- aided apoptosis 
and necrosis can fight numerous disorders, including cancer. Combining localized 
 114 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
magnetic hyperthermia with drug administration may treat the disease. Magnetic 
 nanoparticle- based theranostics can diagnose and treat diseases. CT, MRI, PET, and 
MPI have great potential for accurate illness diagnosis and therapy. Low magnetiza￾tion, intrinsic magnetism’s tendency to combine, and magnetic nanoparticle toxic￾ity demand quick attention. The future of magnetic particles in biomedicine lies in 
knowing their therapeutic efficacy and toxicity in complicated biological systems.

applications in entertainment, communication, health industry, and defense has 
caused electromagnetic radiation to become an environmental pollution problem 
with serious threats to human health and effects that hinder or impede the operation 
or reduce the life of electronic devices ( Niu et al. 2020). For example, the increase 
in the number of electronic devices causes a higher interaction of concurrent electro￾magnetic fields increasing the possibility of operation failures due to cross interfer￾ence. ( Yahyaei and Mohseni 2018). For example, devices such as W i- Fi modems, 
radio, or television, use electronic components such as coils to transmit and receive a 
specific signal, however, the same components generate unwanted additional signals. 
When the electromagnetic field of the additional signal interacts with another device 
or system, electromagnetic interference ( EMI) appears ( Kim et al. 2014). The solu￾tion proposed to avoid this problem has been not to place the devices too close to each 
other, which doesn´t represent a solution of the real problem.
In the military field, radar systems allow to detect targets such as aircrafts, war￾ships, and helicopters, in a specific space volume. Radars are widely used in activi￾ties such as air traffic control, weather monitoring, and speed control. Several studies 
have shown the harmful effects on human health of the exposure to electromagnetic 
signals from radar systems such as the incidence of testicular cancer, leukemia, brain 
tumors, among others ( Variani et al. 2019).
To solve the drawbacks of electromagnetic pollution, microwave- absorbing mate￾rials ( MAMs) have attracted attention in multiple investigations. MAMs are the base 
of electromagnetic shielding which involves the reflection and/ or absorption of EM 
radiation converting the energy of electromagnetic waves into heat. Materials such 
as aluminum, copper, and nickel were the first used to block electromagnetic waves 
due to their electrical and thermal conductivities ( Chung 2020). However, its use 
involves some disadvantages such as corrosion problems, weight, and processing dif￾ficulties. In addition, they don’t have magnetic properties, so their main blocking 
mechanism is the reflection of radiation, which causes the electromagnetic waves to 
continue propagating in the space. Therefore, metals are used mostly to insulate sen￾sitive components or enclosed environments to avoid electromagnetic interference 
( Pandey, Tekumalla, and Gupta 2020).
Nanotechnology is the science of developing and studying materials with dimen￾sions below 100 nm. By reducing the particle size, the properties of the materials 
are modified and improved with respect to their bulk properties, for example, fer￾romagnetic magnetite became superparamagnetic when particle size is below 20 nm 
( Upadhyay, Parekh, and Pandey 2016). Metal nanoparticles are an alternative to 
bulk metals since they manage to solve various inconveniences of the bulk metals 
such as weight, and also, many metal nanoparticles have magnetic properties, which 
made them suitable for MAMs in conjunction with other materials ( Jamkhande 
et al. 2019; Green and Chen 2019). However, metal nanoparticles still are subject to 
corrosion.
On the other hand, metamaterials are topological structures, which can interact 
with electromagnetic radiation. Metamaterials are defined as artificial materials, that 
is, they do not exist in nature, and also provide particle characteristics as negative 
refraction, perfect absorption through the periodic arrangement of structures with 
dimensions less than the wavelength of the incident radiation ( Yoo et al. 2015). Since Magnetic Nanomaterials for Microwave Absorption 123
its invention, metamaterials have been of great interest in different applications such 
as invincibility cloak, zero- index materials, and electromagnetic absorbers. However, 
its development is subject to have specific properties, such as they must be light, 
with thin thickness, and cover wide electromagnetic frequency ranges ( Huang et al. 
2022). In order to achieve those metamaterials, meet the expected characteristics, 
the development with magnetic nanomaterials has become a great effort of the sci￾entific community. The combination of magnetic nanoparticles and incident waves 
allows to trap the incident energy in a small space and to suppress the reflection and 
transmission of radiation, thus managing to absorb the energy and preventing it from 
reaching other areas, devices, or systems. Initially, materials such as silver, copper, 
titanium, chrome, and nickel were widely used. However, the current 2D materials 
such as graphene and nanoparticles of transition metals have drawn attention due 
to their remarkable optical, electrical, and magnetic properties ( Zhou et al. 2020). 
Nanostructured metamaterials have synergetic effects on electromagnetic attenua￾tion as discussed in Section 6.5.
Therefore, the present chapter is organized as follows: Section 6.2 discusses the 
electromagnetic spectrum, with emphasis on the dose effects on human health and 
the need for MAMs and the properties they must fulfill. Section 6.3 presents the 
microwave absorption theory in order to provide the reader with the theoretical basis 
for MAMs operation. Section 6.4 presents the use of several magnetic nanosized 
composite materials for microwave absorption and Section 6.5 depicts the proper￾ties and uses of nanostructured metamaterials, with an emphasis on those fabricated 
from magnetic nanomaterials.
6.2 ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM
Electromagnetic ( EM) radiation consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields 
perpendicular to each other that propagates through space. The whole that encom￾passes the electromagnetic radiation range as a function of the frequency or wave￾length, from microwaves to cosmic rays, is called the EM spectrum, as shown in 
Figure 6.1 (NASA 2010).
The development of wireless devices and systems, such as cell phones, radio sys￾tems, data systems, satellites, medical devices, appliances, and Internet of things 
( IoT), among others, has led to high exposure to EM radiation, with the risks that this 
entails ( Wdowiak et al. 2017; Jauchem 2008). The relationship between the radia￾tion absorbed by the human body and its effects is determined by the equivalent or 
effective dose. The established units for this parameter are the roentgen equivalent 
man ( rem) and sievert ( Sv, J/ kg). 1 rem equals to 0.01 Sv. In addition, millirem o 
mrem ( 1/ 1,000 rem) represents the biological equivalent dose ( Commision n.d.). The 
equivalent dose is calculated by the following equation:
H w T =∑ R T D , R (6.1)
R
Where DT, R is the absorbed dose averaged over the body and wR the radiation weight￾ing factor.
 124 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

Multiple organizations set the radiation exposure limit for the human body 
which should not exceed 50 mSv ( 5 rem) per year, and the limits for different 
body parts are defined as follows: whole body ( 5 rem), eyes ( 15 rem), extremi￾ties (5 0 rem), and 9 months pregnant women ( 0.5 rem) ( Canadian Nuclear Safety 
Commision n.d.; U.S.NRC n.d.). Therefore, there is a great interest in developing 
MAM’s with specific properties such as lightness, flexibility, broadband attenu￾ation, and heat dissipation, among others (B i et al. 2019), to be implemented in 
wearable devices or textiles to ensure that the radiation dose remains below the 
permissible levels, for example, in exposed personnel in military, medical, scien￾tific, or industrial facilities.
6.3 M ICROWAVE ABSORPTION THEORY
Development of new materials with the capability to handle external EM waves is one 
of the proposals to mitigate the problems arising from EM pollution. These materials 
can absorb the incident EM radiation and convert the energy into Joule heat, reducing 
or eliminating the reflection of the waves. The reduction or elimination mechanisms 
of the reflected waves can be divided as follows ( Ruiz- P erez et al. 2022):
 1. Absorption: The ability to convert EM energy into heat is attributed to 
dielectric or magnetic losses which are related to the permeability and per￾mittivity properties of the materials, that is, with the intrinsically magnetic 
or electric loss properties.Magnetic Nanomaterials for Microwave Absorption 125
 2. Multiple reflections: This mechanism allows EM waves to penetrate the 
According to the transmission line theory, the reflection loss ( RL) characteristics 
allow to study the electromagnetic absorption properties of different materials 
through the relative complex permittivity (εr=ε’ − jε’’) and relative complex perme￾ability (μr=μ’ − jμ’’) by the following equations:
µ   2π fd   Z Z in = r
0  tanh  µ ε  j  ε   c  r r  (6.2) r 
Z Z − RL( ) dB = 20 log in 0 (6.3) Z Z in + 0
where Zin represents the impedance of the material medium, Z0 is the impedance of 
the free space (≈ 377 Ω), d is the thickness of the absorber material, f is the electro￾magnetic radiation frequency, and c is the speed of light. Then, the electromagnetic 
absorption response is related with the dielectric and magnetic loss as well as to the 
impedance matching.
6.3.1 dieleCtriC loss
Dielectric materials are electrical insulators that under the action of an electric field 
can create electrical dipoles ( entities with positive and negative charges separated 
by a distance), that is, can be polarized. Due to the electrical polarization of a mate￾rial, positive charges will move in the same direction as the incident electric field, 
while negative charges will move in the opposite direction. Dielectric losses are 
related to the permittivity of the material: the real part (ε’) represents the abil￾ity of the material to interact with the electrical component of the radiation, while 
the imaginary part (ε’’) is related to the losses or attenuation. Dielectric losses are 
defined as the dissipation of energy due to the movement of charges by changing 
the direction of polarization. As shown in F igure 6.2, dielectric losses derive from 
different polarization processes including dipole/ molecular, electronic, ionic, and 
atomic polarization.
When the incident electric field is removed, the dipoles return to their initial ori￾entation due to the influence of thermal motion, and this process is named as polar￾ization relaxation.
The ε’’ parameter, according to the free electron theory, is related to the electrical 
conductivity of the material; from equation ( 6.4), a higher value of electrical conduc￾tivity carries a higher value of ε’’ indicating higher attenuation capability.

Where σ (S /m ) represents the electrical conductivity of the material, ε0 is the dielec￾tric constant in vacuum (8 .854 × 10−12 F/m), and f the frequency ( Hz) ( Micheli et al. 
2010).
However, it is necessary to consider that increasing the electrical conductivity 
will produce an impedance mismatch which will cause an attenuation response 
due to reflection of radiation and not to its absorption. On the other hand, the 
reduction of conductivity of the material may reduce the absorption response 
due to the decrement of the dielectric properties; the compromise point between 
absorption and conductivity is known as percolation threshold ( Qin and Brosseau 
2012).
6.3.2 M agnetiC loss
Dielectric materials have remarkable attenuation responses at frequencies between 
8 and 18 GHz even having low or no impedance matching value due to negligible 
magnetic permeability, that is, having no magnetic properties. In complex perme￾ability as well as complex permittivity, the real part (μ’) and the imaginary part (μ’’) 
represent the storage and attenuation of the energy of a magnetic field capability 
respectively (Z eng et al. 2020).
Magnetic materials provide different loss mechanisms that complement the dielec￾tric losses, that is, hysteresis loss, eddy current loss, and magnetic natural resonance. 
These mechanisms refer to different processes of energy dissipation when a magnetic 
material interacts with a time-v arying external field ( Bertotti and Fiorillo 2016). The 
magnetic properties of materials originate from the motion of electrons and the mag￾netic momentum of atoms. As with electric dipoles, magnetic dipoles are defined Magnetic Nanomaterials for Microwave Absorption 127

as the North and South poles rather than positive and negative charges. F igure 6.3 
shows the hysteresis curve of some types of magnetic materials: as can be seen, at the 
 zero- field point the magnetic domains are randomly orientated. Subsequently, when 
the magnetic field increases, the domains begin to orient in the direction of the inci￾dent field to a point of saturation. When the magnetic field is removed, there may be 
two cases: ( i) the domains keep a certain degree of orientation, that is, they continue 
being magnetic after removing the incident field, a property named field retentivity; 
in this case, the field required to remove the remnant magnetization, that is, to ran￾domize the magnetic domains, is called coercivity field; (i i) the domains return to 
their initial random state just after removing the field, so very small or null coercivity 
field is required to remove the magnetization. The described cases represent different 
kinds of magnetic materials: (i ) ferromagnetic or (i i) superparamagnetic materials, 
respectively.
The properties of superparamagnetic materials make them ideal candidates for 
implementation as radiation attenuators, since the energy of the incident wave will be 
reduced while orienting the magnetic domains; once eliminating the incident wave, 
the magnetic domains will return to the initial state spontaneously, to attenuate the 
energy of new incident electromagnetic fields.
6.3.3 i nfluenCe of size faCtor in MiCrowave absorption
The term “ nano” is used to define 10−9 ( o ne- billionth of a meter). Nanomaterials 
are those with one of its physical dimensions less than 100 nanometers. In 
nanoscale, the bulk material properties change from classical physics to quantum 
mechanisms. Gold, for example, has been classified as a chemical inert material 128 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

with remarkable electrical conductivity and a yellowish color. However, in the 
nanoscale, it has semiconductor properties and presents a reddish color (S un et al. 
2015). The dielectric and magnetic properties of materials are directly related to 
their size. By reducing the size of particles to nanoscale, the ability to interact 
with electromagnetic radiation is increased. In addition, due to the high specific 
surface area of nanoscale materials, attenuation caused by the relaxation processes 
is improved ( Huo, Wang, and Yu 2009). Joule dissipation and dielectric loss are 
also improved in nanomaterials because of their large area/ volume ratio and small 
sizes which allow an enhanced polarizability compared with the bulk state. Also, 
nanomaterials would improve the wave scattering and destructive interference. 
 Multi- magnetic domain structures are present in bulky magnetic materials, but by 
reducing the material to nanoscale, the m ulti-m agnetic domains are converted to 
single magnetic structures. Superparamagnetic response occurs in nanoparticles 
with diameters between 3 and 50 nm depending on the material ( Soler and Paterno 
2017). In particles with such sizes, there is no presence of coercive field in their 
hysteresis curves.
For example, Fe3O4 nanoparticles can display superparamagnetic ( SPR) or fer￾romagnetic ( FM) behavior, as shown in F igure 6.4a. The hysteresis curve of FM 
materials exhibits HC and MR values indicating the magnetic retention. On the 
other hand, the coercivity and remanent magnetization of SPM nanoparticles are 
equal to zero. The magnetic response depends on the particle size, as depicted 
in Figure  6.4b; the transition sizes from superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic 
response is around 25 nm, while the transition from single to multiple magnetic 
domain is around 80 nm, respectively (N guyen et al. 2021). The control of particle 
size below the superparamagnetic transition then enables to enhance the attenua￾tion response in MAMs.Magnetic Nanomaterials for Microwave Absorption 129
6.4 MAGNETIC NANOSIZED COMPOSITE MATERIALS 
FOR MICROWAVE ABSORPTION
For the development of materials that attenuate electromagnetic radiation, the com￾bination of dielectric and magnetic materials, which leads to a synergy between both 
types of loses, has been a widely studied route. Composite materials are the combina￾tion of two or more materials with different physical and chemical properties and the 
resulting material of this combination has different properties from the individuals. 
Therefore, the electromagnetic response of a composite material can be tailored by 
varying the fractions of the composite constituents. For example, nanomaterials have 
been dispersed in polymer- based matrixes for electromagnetic attenuation applica￾tions. Polymeric nanocomposites aim to cover the expected E MI- shielding mate￾rial properties such as high surface area, lightness, corrosion resistance, and tunable 
electrical and magnetic properties. In the following sections, different examples of 
composites for MAMs are discussed.
6.4.1 Carbon MagnetiC Materials
Traditionally, metals such as copper, nickel, and aluminum are the most used materi￾als in electromagnetic protection applications; however, they generate various dis￾advantages such as adding additional weight to the system and being susceptible to 
corrosion. Carbon is one of the most abundant materials on Earth and can be found 
naturally in two allotropes, graphite, and diamond. Other carbon allotropes are car￾bon nanotubes, graphene, fullerenes, and carbon fibers. As an alternative to metallic 
materials for EMI shielding, carbon- based materials have attracted attention due to 
their low density, hardness, high thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, high and 
tunable electrical conductivity, high surface area, and potential EM wave absorption 
capacity ( D.- C. Wang et al. 2021). However, the difference between permeability and 
permittivity values of ca rbon- based materials causes their electromagnetic attenua￾tion response to be deficient. The combination of magnetic nanomaterials and carbon 
allotropes to form carbon magnetic composites has been implemented to improve 
the electromagnetic attenuation response of carbon- based materials ( B. Wang et al. 
2021). Among these materials, carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, and graphene have 
been tested for the development of r adiation- absorbing materials because of their 
high surface area and chemical modification possibilities ( Y. Wang et al. 2020).
6.4.1.1 Carbon Fiber Composites
Carbon fiber ( CF) has remarkable properties such as high tensile strength, high 
Young’s modulus, low density, and high electrical conductivity. Ranjkesh and 
Nasouri studied microwave- absorbing materials based on Ni/ C from the carboniza￾tion of Ni( NO3)2 6H2 O- impregnated cigarette buts ( Ranjkesh and Nasouri 2022). 
The formation of nickel nanoparticles was performed on carbon fibers, and it was 
observed that the morphology of nanoparticles varied according to the synthesis 
parameters. As shown in Figure 6.5a, Ni nanoparticles range from 20 to 40 nm. The 
magnetic hysteresis curves presented in Figure 6.5b were S- like type, related to soft 
ferromagnetic behavior, that is, materials that can be magnetized and demagnetized 130 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

easily, as depicted in F igure 6.5c. The magnetic properties increased with the nickel 
contents on the surface of the composite.
Pure carbon nanofibers have high dielectric properties and null magnetic prop￾erties, leading to weak impedance matching. By the incorporation of TiN, a semi￾conductor material with outstanding dielectric and magnetic properties into carbon 
nanofibers, the contribution of magnetic losses to EM attenuation is increased and 
generates a synergy with the dielectric losses ( Yu et al. 2022). TiN nanoparticles 
generate defects in the structure of CF, increasing the charge carrier concentra￾tion and therefore the electric conductivity, demonstrating that the conductivity 
of the material can be modulated with the concentration of a dielectric material. 
On the other hand, the material has considerable magnetic properties attributed to 
the defects and vacancies caused by the TiN network. By increasing the number of 
defects and exceeding the equilibrium point, local magnetic moments are generated. 
For TiN/N CF, TiN- induced defects provide the magnetic properties that allow the 
impedance matching for electromagnetic attenuation. The microwave absorption of 
the composite was evaluated in the frequency range of 2 – 18 GHz at varying absorber 
coating thicknesses from 1 to 6 mm. A maximum attenuation value of −45.19 dB at Magnetic Nanomaterials for Microwave Absorption 131
15.6 GHz was obtained with a coating thickness of 1.91 mm. However, attenuation 
values higher than −20 dB were obtained in the range of 3. 89– 18 GHz, covering part 
of the S- band and up to the C- Ku band, as shown in Figure 6.6a. This behavior was 
attributed to different loss mechanisms, including the morphology of TiN/ NCNF 
which provides channels for the movement of the charges, as well as the TiN- induced 
defects which contribute to an increased carrier concentration that in turn, potenti￾ated dielectric losses. Furthermore, the defects and bonds present in the composite 
contribute to dipolar relaxation. Finally, TiN defects and vacancies generate a ferro￾magnetic response that contributes to the processes of magnetic loss. The mentioned 
mechanisms are represented in F igure 6.6b.
Magnetic metal oxides with carbon- based materials have been widely pro￾posed for electromagnetic attenuation. Among the different magnetic metal

oxides, magnetite ( Fe3O4) is among the most studied materials for electromag￾netic absorption due to its magnetic properties described above, and low cost. 
However, the lack of dielectric properties limits the development of absorbent 
materials using Fe3O4 nanoparticles alone. Gang et  al. report the design and 
synthesis by a solvothermal route of a bilayer absorber based on Fe3O4@carbon 
nanofiber as an absorbing layer and Fe3O4/ rGO composite as a matching layer. 
In Figure 6.7a, Fe3O4 NPs onto the CF are shown. Correspondingly, circular, and 
hexagonal particles with sizes around 75–1 55 nm agglomerated by Van der Waals 
forces, are observed in F igure 6.7b. In the hysteresis loop, the low coercivity field 
indicated the soft magnetic nature of the CF/ Fe3O4 composite. The electromag￾netic attenuation response of composites with thicknesses ranging from 1.4 to 
3 mm was evaluated between 8 and 13 GHz. The composite with a thickness of 
1.4 mm presented the highest attenuation, as shown in Figure  6.7c, the highest 
reflection loss corresponds to −52.5 dB at 10.8 GHz. In addition, by varying the 
thickness of the material, the response was modulated to other frequencies. The 
excellent response of electromagnetic attenuation was attributed to the synergy 
of the electrical and magnetic properties of the materials, allowing rotation of Magnetic Nanomaterials for Microwave Absorption 133
dipoles, multiple interfacial polarizations, and matching impedance ( Gang, Niaz 
Akhtar, and Boudaghi 2021).
6.4.1.2 Magnetic Graphene
Graphene is another carbon allotrope that has received the attention of researchers for 
the development of radiation- absorbing material due to its remarkable properties such 
as the excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, high surface area, and the thick￾ness of a carbon atom, making it an u ltra- thin material ( Zhu et al. 2010). Like CNFs, 
despite its excellent intrinsic properties, the use of graphene for electromagnetic attenu￾ation makes impossible its implementation due to its high electrical conductivity and 
null magnetic properties, which causes an impedance mismatch. The combination of 
graphene with magnetic nanomaterials has covered the disadvantage of impedance 
mismatch allowing graphene to be used as an electromagnetic absorber material. The 
incorporation of nickel- based nanoparticles has proven its effectiveness for the devel￾opment of microwave- absorbing materials. Hou et  al. synthesized xNi/ yNiO/ rGO 
( NNG) composites by hydrothermal method and calcination reduction process ( Hou 
et al. 2022). The magnetic characterization of xNi/ yNi nanoparticles ( NN), as shown in 
 Figure 6.8a, demonstrates a high magnetic saturation of NN particles. Introducing rGO 
without magnetic properties results in a decrease in the magnetic response. The NNG 
samples show a soft ferromagnetic response. The study depicted that the incorporation 
of NN magnetic nanoparticles allows to adjust the impedance matching successfully. As 
a result, the composite displays electromagnetic attenuation at different frequencies with 
different thicknesses. As shown in Figure 6.8b, the material has the optimal response of 
−46.5 dB EN 3.57 GHz with thickness of 3.6 mm. Figure 6.8c illustrates the proposed 
attenuation mechanisms, the dielectric losses are improved by the polarization produced 
by the load on the surface of NNG composite, and the dipolar polarization by functional 
groups and defects in the graphene sheets. The NN nanoparticles dispersed into the 
graphene sheets generate a synergistic effect of electromagnetic dissipation.
Qu et al. prepared a graphene- based composite microwave- absorbing material under 
mild reaction conditions using dopamine ( DA) to form polydopamine ( PDA) through a 
mild self- polymerization reaction. The FeCoNiOX-PDA-rGO composite was achieved by
chemical reduction method and deposition of metal nanoparticles on PDA surface ( Qu 
et al. 2021). In Figure 6.9a, TEM images show FeCoNiOx nanoparticles about 100 nm 
wrapped by a thin PDA- rGO layer, which provides corrosion resistance to the composite 
allowing to keep the magnetic properties and improve the impedance matching in differ￾ent environments. Figure 6.9b shows the hysteresis loop diagram of the different samples. 
Due to the presence of magnetic nanoparticles, the composite has magnetic and dielec￾tric losses, which leads to the dissipation of electromagnetic waves. In general, magnetic 
losses are relatively weak, so magnetic materials play a major role in impedance coupling 
due to the high conductivity of the graphene substrate. The composites show different 
absorbing performance which can be adjusted by modifying the amount of magnetic 
material into the composite. According to Figure 6.9c, the attenuation response between 
5 and 18 GHz can be adjusted by modifying the thickness of the composite coating.
Conventionally, the response of materials developed for electromagnetic attenu￾ation depends on the amount of the magnetic material in the matrix. As an uncon￾ventional proposal, polymer nanomaterials have been used with high efficiency,

flexibility, and corrosion resistance (G upta et al. 2014). A graphene, magnetite ( Fe3O4) 
nanoparticles and polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA), PVA/G r(x )/ Fe3O4(0.1-x) hybrid, was stud￾ied by Khodiri et  al. ( 2020). PVA is an interesting polymer due to its remarkable 
properties such as flexibility, hydrophilicity, and low cost. Fe3O4 nanoparticles provide 
the good magnetic properties. In addition, its low conductivity allows EM radiation 
to penetrate the material and be attenuated. The SEM image in Figure 6.10a shows 
spherical magnetite particles with size around 12 nm, which in combination with the 
graphene morphology improve the electromagnetic attenuation. As mentioned, super￾paramagnetic behavior is an important characteristic for the development of MAMs. 
To study the influence of magnetite nanoparticles, the hysteresis curves of the materi￾als were obtained. F igure 6.10b shows the hysteresis loops of PVA/ Gr(x )/ Fe3O4 (with
different graphene concentrations (0 .08 and 0.02 wt%)). The curves have the S - like Magnetic Nanomaterials for Microwave Absorption 135

shape characteristic of SPM materials. The reduction of saturation of magnetization 
values can be attributed to the mayor graphene content which has more OH groups, 
which affect the magnetic response. On the other hand, increasing the concentration 
of Fe3O4 nanoparticles results in higher MS value. According with Figure 6.10c, the 
shielding effectiveness ( SET) of the nanocomposite in the band X - band ( 8– 12 GHz) is 
increased by increasing the concentration of graphene in the polymer network, which 
improves the interaction between particles. The electromagnetic attenuation response, 
as shown in F igure 6.10d, is attributed to different phenomena, that is, part of the inci￾dent radiation is reflected while another part penetrates the structure and is absorbed 
due to the interaction with the materials and the multiple internal reflections.
6.5 NANOSTRUCTURED METAMATERIALS
Despite the remarkable response of magnetic nanomaterials in MAMs, they have as 
main disadvantage the short range of frequency attenuation of the electromagnetic 
radiation, which limits its implementation in practical applications. To overcome this 136 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

problem, the implementation of the so-ca lled metamaterials has been explored as an 
alternative to enhance the MAMs performance.
Metamaterials are 3D geometric structures, usually formed by metal resona￾tor arrays at micro or nanoscale developed to attenuate electromagnetic radiation 
at wide frequency intervals seeking to cover multiple bands ( Argyros et al. 2015). 
Nanostructured metamaterials, build from nanocomposites with good attenuation 
response, combine the large interactions between the incident wave and the mate￾rial, occurring in the metamaterial 3D structures with the intrinsic electromagnetic 
attenuation response of magnetic nanomaterials, enhancing their implementation in 
practical applications. Metamaterials usually have dimensions above 50 microns, but 
due to their remarkable attenuation properties, the nanostructured metamaterials, 
build from magnetic nanocomposites are considered in this chapter.
Huang et  al. report an electromagnetic composite metamaterial ( ECM) with 
truncated pyramidal shape, build from spherical carbonyl iron (C I) nanoparticles 
and multiwall carbon nanotubes (M WCNT), as shown in Figure 6.11a, to adjust 
impedance matching with air. In the nanoscale, MWCNT provides the dielectric Magnetic Nanomaterials for Microwave Absorption 137

provide the magnetic losses due to spin rotation. Different content of MWCNT and 
CI particles influence the position of the reflectivity peaks due to impedance cou￾pling. The introduction of carbonyl iron particles generates magnetic losses due to 
the time lapse between the incident magnetic field and the magnetization generated 
when penetrating the compound, in addition to the eddy currents. Traditionally 
metamaterials used as selective frequency surfaces have thicknesses around 50 
µm. However, the absorption bandwidth increases with the thickness, due to the 
enhanced electrical interaction in the material. 3D structures have proven their 
efficiency for electromagnetic attenuation by combining bulk, micro- , and nano- 
 level attenuation mechanisms ( W. Li et al. 2017). The response of the truncated

pyramidal ECM was evaluated in the frequency range of 2 – 40 GHz showing 
five absorption peaks, including 2.84, 15, 22.82, 29, and 33.95 GHz, as shown in 
 Figure 6.11c. In this way, the combination of dielectric and magnetic loss materials 
with a periodic 3D structure with tunable attenuation and frequency range, was 
demonstrated ( Huang et al. 2018).
On the other hand, in-silico studies have been performed to evaluate the atten￾uation response of metamaterials based on superparamagnetic nanocomposites. 
An in- silico study of c hessboard- like structures with panels of different thick￾nesses made from a ternary rGO/ Fe3O4/ PPy nanocomposite was done to opti￾mize the thickness ratio to get a maximum attenuation response ( Ruiz- Perez, 
Estrada, and Briones 2022). In this composite, reduced graphene oxide was 
decorated with magnetite nanoparticles below the superparamagnetic threshold. 
 Figure 6.12a shows the 5 × 5 chessboard- like surface with different heights which 
were varied as shown in Figure 6.12b. As shown in Figure 6.12c, the attenua￾tion result of s ingle- layer composites shows a maximum response of −37 dB at 
11.8 GHz. On the other hand, the response of the metamaterial can be modu￾lated in the X- band ( 8– 12 GHz) and has an increase in the attenuation bandwidth. 
These results demonstrate the synergetic effects of the nanoscale properties of 
the composites, combined with the metamaterial 3D structuring. Additionally, 
with the use of metamaterials, additive manufacturing can be implemented to 
enhance the applicability of magnetic nanocomposites as electromagnetic attenu￾ation materials.
6.6 APPLICATIONS
In the military detection field, the main objective of electromagnetic absorption is to 
reduce the radar cross-section (RCS), that is, the signal reflected to the antenna by 
the target, to avoid its detection by radars systems. The development and implemen￾tation of materials and structures with broadband attenuation at different frequency 
ranges such as L, S, and C bands ( 1– 2, 2– 4, 4– 8 GHz, respectively), which are of 
great interest on military applications ( Panwar and Lee 2019; J. Li et al. 2021). In 
addition, with the goal of protecting the operator of radar detection systems, wear￾able textiles carbon- based have been developed into a non- woven matrix with poten￾tial application in X- band ( 8– 12 GHz) radar systems ( Song et al. 2017). Studies have 
shown the potential application of r adiation- absorbing materials and structures. In 
communication systems, the metamaterials based on nanomagnetic materials have 
demonstrated their potential application to attenuate the radiation used in 5G tech￾nology ( Yan et al. 2022). In electronic field, carbon- based materials have been stud￾ied to reduce or eliminate the reflectance of electromagnetic radiation to protect and 
ensure the operation of various devices. The materials were evaluated in the fre￾quency range of 100 MHz to 10 GHz, reducing the reflectance by up to 30% ( Kubacki 
et  al. 2022). Another development was a wearable textile based on magnetic and 
conductive materials that, in combination with me ta- structure arrays attenuate radia￾tion at 2.4 GHz making it a potential candidate for the creation of devices with Wi- Fi 
technology such as medical monitoring devices ( El Atrash, Abdalla, and Elhennawy 
2021).

6.7 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Nanomaterials have remarkable properties in comparison with their bulk counter￾parts. Magnetic nanomaterials have demonstrated their potential to improve the 
response of MAMs. Its characteristic properties, together with different ca rbon- 
 based materials allowed the development of innovative technologies and methods 
that cover the protection needs in electronics, screening, and health care, at wide 
frequency intervals, as well as its application in military fields such as radar target 
hiding or health care of military personal. In addition, these materials overcome 
the disadvantages of conventional electromagnetic blocking methods because they 
are lightweight, flexible, anti- corrosive, and applicable in wearables and textiles. On 
the other hand, nanostructured metamaterials, prepared from nanocomposite radia￾tion absorbers have a synergetic effect which has allowed to generate more efficient 
attenuation devices, with the possibility of being prepared by additive manufactur￾ing. However, despite the results obtained, it is necessary to continue the developing 
of novel nanomaterials and composites with higher magnetic response, explore more 140 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
applications in wearable technologies, and delve more into the study of the mecha￾nisms of attenuation to better understand its operation, looking for faster product 
development.

7.1 INTRODUCTION
It has long been understood that a structure’s properties, behavior, and potential 
applications are intensely affected by the number of atoms in that structure [1]. The 
reduction of crystalline structures suggests that the characteristics of individual atoms 
are entirely different than in the bulk of the same material. The recent size decrease 
of device components, mostly electronic components, has achieved great interest in 
understanding the peculiar behavior of very small structures [2]. The importance of 
the length scale of nanometers in terms of size effects increases when at least one 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003335580-7146 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
dimension of a crystal is reduced to the order of hundreds of atoms. As a result, the field 
of “ nanotechnology” has grown quickly, and nanotechnology is the study and creation 
of matter on a microscopic scale [3]. In general, structures between 1 and 100 nm in 
at least one dimension are of interest to nanotechnology, which involves the creation 
of materials or technologies within that range. Richered Feyman was the first scien￾tist who used the word nanotechnology in his speech “ There’s Plenty of Room at the 
Bottom,” which he delivered on December 29, 1959 [4, 5]. Feynman believed that direct 
atom manipulation has a more effective kind of synthetic chemistry than bulk methods 
[6]. In 1974, at Tokyo University of Sciences professor Norio Taniguchi invented the 
term “na notechnology”. Due mostly to the development of STM ( scanning tunneling 
microscope) and the emergence of cluster science, nanotechnology gained prominence 
in the 1980s. The discovery and use of fullerenes came next in the middle of the 1980s, 
semiconductor nanocrystal discovery also supported its development [7, 8].
A nanomaterial is a physical substance having at least one characteristic dimen￾sion ranging from 1 to 100 nm [9]. The characteristics of nanomaterials can differ 
from those of materials of micron or millimeter dimensions. Surface- related effects 
and quantum confinement effects are two main categories into which the unique 
properties of nanomaterials can be classified as indicated in F igure 7.1. Atoms on a 
material surface have a different bonding structure from those below the surface, and 
they could be exposed to a different chemical environment, such as oxide or hydrogen 
termination forms [10, 11]. These atoms act differently from other atoms in a crystal 
as a result, and events occurring at a material surface are typical of little conse￾quence to the material’s overall behavior since the surface atoms to bulk atoms ratio 
is negligible in bulk materials. However, because creation at the nanoscale involves 
such a high ratio of surface to volume, surface effects are unavoidable. Additionally, 
substantial portion of surface atoms may cause the solid- state structure to change 
slightly, decreasing overall stability. Quantum effects happen when an electron wave￾length in a material is on level with the material dimension. The substance becomes 
quantized in that restricting dimension due to the restriction on an electron path of 
travel. The density of states is then dependent on the number of dimensions in which 
electrons are quantized.
FIGURE 7.1 ( a) Classification of nanomaterials. ( b) Effect of size on band gaps.Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Applications 147
Furthermore, when compared to macroscopic systems, many physical ( mechanical, 
electrical, optical, etc.) attributes alter. The rise in energy difference between energy 
levels and bandgap is caused by quantum confinement. When the restricting dimen￾sion is enormous in comparison to the particle wavelength, the particle acts as if it 
were free. Because of the continuous energy state, the bandgap stays at its initial 
energy during this condition. The energy spectrum becomes distinct when the lim￾iting dimension lowers and reaches a particular limit, often at the nanoscale. As a 
result, the bandgap now depends on the size [12, 13].
Several magnetic nanoparticles, for example, iron, nickel, aluminum, gold, and 
cobalt, are used as a photocatalyst, and much research into such materials has been 
conducted. Functionalized magnetic particles with certain structural arrangements 
are prepared by coprecipitation, thermal decomposition, microemulsion, hydrother￾mal, sol- gel, microwave, flame spray, laser ablation, ultrasonic- assisted, and sono￾chemical techniques. Aside from photocatalysis, these magnetic nanomaterials can 
be employed in lithium- ion batteries and solar panel sensors. As shown in Figure 7.2, 
several methods have been employed to synthesize magnetic nanomaterials.
These methods are mainly based on two approaches, namely the “ top- down 
approach” as well as “ bottom- up approach.” Large materials ( bulk materials) are 
broken down into little fragments of material in the top- down technique [14]. This

method is commonly utilized when external control is required to get the desired 
form and morphologies. This technique is appealing because of its application in 
metals, semiconductors, l arge- scale production, lesser precision accuracy, and regu￾lated parameters [15]. Bottom- up approaches are used to create more refined materi￾als by combining simple at omic- level components while managing process factors 
like pH, size, morphology, pattern, and w ell-a rrangement. Bottom-u p approaches are 
commonly employed because they are speedier, have l arge-s cale manufacturability, 
have extremely little contamination, are more cost- effective, have high quality, and 
have an aligned structure. A schematic for b ottom- up and t op-d own approaches is 
illustrated in Figure 7.3.
7.2 PHOTOCATALYTIC DEGRADATION (PCD)
One of the first to perform tests to see whether “ light and light alone” would assist 
chemical reactions was chemist Giacomo Ciamician in 1901 [16, 17]. He conducted 
tests with blue as well as red lights and then discovered that only blue light had a 
chemical reaction. He was careful enough to rule out the concept that thermal heating 
brought on by light was what was driving these reactions. The term “ photocatalysis” 
first appears in the scientific literature in 1911. In 1932, it was reported that TiO2Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Applications 149
and Nb2O5 were the catalysts for photocatalytic reductions of AgNO3 to Ag and then 
AuCl3 to Au. Following that, in 1938, TiO2 was studied in the presence of O2 as a 
photosensitizer to bleach dyes. Nevertheless, the lack of widely used practical appli￾cations meant that interest in photocatalysis continued as a hobby. Early in the 1970s, 
things started to shift for two reasons. First, the “ oil crisis” inspired scientists to 
look for fossil fuel alternatives. Second, the search for renewable energy sources 
was generated by the researcher about the effects of large- scale industrial opera￾tions on the environment. Several significant papers were published at this time. Bell 
Lab researchers published the first study on O2 evolution from TiO2 in 1968 [18], 
using TiO2 electrode and UV- light irradiation, Fujishima, as well as Honda, stated 
photo-assisted H2O oxidation with H2 generation in 1972 [19]. In 1979, investiga￾tions on photocatalytic CO2 reduction retaining several inorganic semiconductors 
as photocatalysts were published by Fujishima et  al. [20]. In the 1980s, research 
on analogous processes utilizing, in particular, TiO2 nanoparticles as photocatalysts 
received substantial interest as a result of these early efforts to expand the uses of 
photocatalysis. Since then, research has focused on realizing the underlying ideas, 
improving photocatalytic effectiveness, looking for new photocatalysts as well as 
broadening the scope of reaction [21]. For example, in 1997, the discovery of the 
TiO2 photo-induced super-hydrophilicity effect. TiO2, which possesses self-cleaning 
also anti- fogging properties, had thus been used in construction materials. Various 
candidates with greater photocatalytic activity than TiO2 had been examined in the 
creation of novel photocatalysts; the majority of these candidates have large band 
gaps also are only active under UV rays. Photocatalysts that absorb visible light have 
also been studied in parallel for improved efficiency.
Bokare et  al. investigated the use of Fe/ Ni bimetallic nanoparticles to remove 
the pollutant organic dye Orange G from an aqueous solution [22]. Fe/ Pd bimetallic 
nanoparticle dechlorinate 5 mg/ L of lindane ( gamma- hexachlorocyclohexane) regu￾lated within 5 minutes at a catalyst stocking of 0.5 g/ L, according to research on 
the Fe/ Pd nanoparticles degrade lindane 120 ( gamma- hexachlorocyclohexane) in an 
aqueous solution [23]. According to Mohamed et al. [28], there are double primary 
categories of photocatalysis processes: ( i) catalyzed photoreactions also ( ii) sensitized 
photoreactions. The first category is cat alyst- driven photoreaction. A g round- state 
molecule is then given an electron via a photo- excited catalyst. When dye molecules 
undergo sensitized photo- excitation and relate to the g round- state catalyst, early light 
excitation results [24].
According to Qu et al. [25], photocatalysis has exhibited tremendous potential 
since it is inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and supportability in water degra￾dation technology. The exploitation of nanoparticles in this remedy method, in par￾ticular, is of critical concern. Nanoscale semiconductors including nano- TiO2, ZnO, 
CdS, BiVO4, and WO3 are among the mainly utilized photocatalytic nanocatalyst 
in wastewater remedies. TiO2 is furthermost preferred because of its low toxicity, 
chemical strength, and low cost, as well as wide obtainability as a material. Though, 
the actual application of TiO2 as a photocatalyst has been disadvantaged by various 
restrictions, such as the requirement for employing aqueous solutions limits its broad 
practical usage and challenges its residue separation and recycling of the photocata￾lyst. Another issue is photocatalyst optimization to take advantage of visible light 
 150 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
from solar radiation which is 45% of the solar spectrum. The latter difficulty, fortu￾nately, may be handled by doping metal or a nion- impurities into na no- TiO2, utilizing 
dye sensitizers, or combining nano- TiO2 with the narrow bandgap semiconductor to 
generate hybrid nano-composites [25].
7.2.1 basiC prinCiple of a photoCatalytiC oxidation proCess
In continuous semiconductor photocatalysis, photocatalysis is an advanced oxidation 
process ( AOP) for eliminating organic contaminants ( e.g., TiO2, BiVO4, ZnO, FeO), 
a light source as well as an oxidizing facilitator [26]. When a semiconducting cata￾lyst is permitted to be lit by a photon of energy equal to or higher than the bandgap 
energy (Eg) of the semiconductor, an electron from the valence band to the conduc￾tion band is accelerated. Simultaneously, it created an electron vacancy, also known 
as a hole ( h), in the valence band within a semiconductor [27].
Mohamed et al. [28] explore how photogenerated positive holes oxidize with water 
to form hydroxyl radicals ( OH•
), whereas electrons produce superoxide radicals via 
the oxygen reaction. Both of these major products, specifically ( OH•
), are long-lasting 
oxidizing types that produce organic pollutants [28].
According to Ahmed and Khurshid [26], the rate of oxygen breakdown and con￾taminant oxidation must be consistent during the photocatalytic removal of carbon- 
 based contaminants. As a result, the photocatalytic oxidation process will be slowed 
down and the rate of e lectron– hole pair ( EHP) recombination will increase ( usually 
if there is not enough oxygen in the solution). However, intrinsic catalyst character￾istics including crystal structure, surface area, particle size, band gap, and outward 
hydroxyl compactness play a significant role in photocatalytic activities [26].
When the catalyst is illuminated, EHPs are produced to the valence electron pro￾motion to the conduction band. The water molecule is conquered by the hole created 
on the catalyst and transformed into a hydroxyl radical, which possesses the same 
significant oxidizing exponents. When organic pollutants are present, they react with 
these hydroxyl groups, which causes them to break up. If the entire process is carried 
out in the presence of oxygen, a chain reaction between the constituent molecules 
intervening in radicals and oxygen atoms occurs. When an organic pollutant is pro￾duced, carbon dioxide and water are the consequences. A schematic diagram for 
photocatalytic procedure is illustrated in Figure 7.4.
The copulating reaction is one way that atmospheric oxygen is reduced. Because 
oxygen is easily reduced, it has a s tep- down option for producing hydrogen. 
Conduction band electrons react with oxygen to create a superoxide anion. The ion 
can also form a link with the mediator of an oxidation chemical process, which pro￾duces peroxides before turning them into water. Similar to water, organic matter can 
quickly experience cognitive reduction. This is why, as shown in F igure 7.5, a high 
organic matter concentration increases the photocatalytic response by increasing the 
likelihood of the number of holes, which ultimately deoxidizes the recombination 
value of carriers.
Oxidation and reduction responses occur simultaneously in a photocatalytic 
process. For photocatalytic response, we need specific materials or catalysts that 
accompany particular oxidation and reduction reactions. Materials are generally Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Applications 151
divided into three primary classes: conductor, dielectric, and semiconducting mate￾rial. This division is based on electronic characteristics. Convergence between the 
valence and conduction band occurs in a conductor. Essential to a photocatalytic 
reaction is simultaneous oxidation and reduction, but only free electrons may be used 
in conductivity. We only do one oxidation reaction at a time on a conductor, not both 
reactions at once. Alkaline earth metals, transition metals, and alkalis are the best 
conductors. They either lack a suitable band gap or, more commonly, their conduc￾tion and valence bands intersect. They weren’t favored for catalytic activity in reac￾tions. Dielectrics have a large band gap and a high energy threshold for carrying out 
oxidation and reduction reactions. We cannot use dielectric as a catalyst to split apart 
water molecules. We need an eccentric catalyst that ignites in either the visible or 
ultraviolet illumination spectrum. Additionally, insulators lack free electrons, which 
FIGURE 7.4 Schematic representation of photocatalytic procedures ( Mohamed and Bahnemann, 
2012).
FIGURE 7.5 Schematic presentation of photocatalytic basic principle.152 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
prevents oxidation from occurring, that is why they are not suitable for the photolytic 
process. Being dielectric, all gases weren’t suitable for the photocatalytic reaction. 
When it comes to semiconducting materials, oxidation and reduction have the capac￾ity to occur simultaneously and have tunable band gaps. Free EHPs are produced as 
the light falls. The low recombination value is an essential need for a semiconducting 
substance to function as a photocatalyst. Additionally, semiconductors with a band 
gap between 1.5 and 3.5 eV or an unnoticeable domain between 420 and 800 nm are 
appropriate for photocatalytic activity. Since they exhibit catalytic activity in visible 
light. As a photocatalyst for the UV–visible range, we expect a semiconductor with 
a band gap of only 1.5–3.5 eV, which is unusual for semiconductors. Most metallic 
oxides belong to this category, they also possess additional qualities that create them 
appropriate as photocatalysts, which are mentioned lower. Metal oxides are crucial in 
photocatalysis and several electrical applications. They completely meet our neces￾sities for a photocatalyst. Metal oxides are suitable for this assumption because of 
its favorable band gap, electrical structure, light absorption, and carrier transporta￾tion. A band gap is the most fundamental and crucial dimension that a photocatalyst 
should possess. Band gap should be within the UV–visible range are affordable, the 
stability of the building is one of the other properties. Such as morphology, reus￾ability, and large area. These characteristics are shared by a variety of metal oxides, 
including the oxides of titanium, vanadium, cerium, zinc, and chromium. They are 
used as photocatalysts as a result when unprotected from visible light, the photocata￾lyst absorbs a photon and also activates the higher conduction band, producing an 
EHP. This EHP causes oxidation–reduction reactions, which break down contami￾nants, to occur along the surface of metal oxide. Because of this, metal oxide is often 
used as a photocatalyst.
The general mechanism for a photocatalytic chemical reaction involves five basic 
steps: reactant diffusion on the surface of the catalyst in step 1, reactant adsorption 
on the catalyst surface in step 2, basic reaction on the catalyst surface in step 3, pro￾duction desorption in step 4, and product diffusion on the catalyst surface in step 5. 
General mechanism of organic pollutant degradation is in the steps that follow:

When comparing wastewater handling and photocatalytic activity, different factors 
play an essential role.
EHP detachment rate is one important component. Semiconducting material’s 
EHPs have very short lifetimes. The use of a catalyst in a subordinate response before 
recombination must be permanent. When compared to a conventional hydrogen elec￾trode, the redox potential for the hole also electron in TiO2 is, respectively, 1.0–3.5 
and 0. 5– 1.5 V. The hole is a good oxidizing agent in the valance band. A great pho￾tocatalyst should have a broad band gap as well as least amount of electron– hole 
recombination [29].
The catalyst structure affect the photocatalytic activity. For instance, rutile, brook￾ite, and anatase are the three different forms of titanium dioxide ( TiO2). Anatase 
is the most effective of these three due to its w ell- balanced structure, exceptional 
adsorption capacity, and appropriate conduction band position. A key component of 
the corrosion process is morphology. Photocatalyst is used in nano form rather than 
bulk form because we understand that on the nanoscale, materials bear tiny size 
and also higher expanse attainable for chemical reaction, increasing reaction range. 
Because it has a greater specific surface area, zinc oxide sample distribution with a 
spherical shape performs more effectively than rod- like structures. To put it another 
way, we assume that surface to volume ratio is modified, allowing multiple reactants 
to respond to the catalyst at the same time, for example, na no- sized TiO2 is stronger 
than bulk TiO2
The pH of solution also plays a crucial role in effectiveness of a photocatalyst. 
By altering the surface charges of the photocatalyst, pH affects its activity. It can 
be explained by electrostatic interaction between pollution atoms and charged par￾ticles. Here, results of photocatalytic activity for dye versus photocatalyst in metal￾lic element oxide semiconducting materials under various pH scales are discussed. 
According to published research, photocatalyst performance is lower for pH scales 
lower than 5, or moderately acidic conditions. This is because the proton concentra￾tion is higher at these pH levels, which causes slower dye debasement. After all, there 
are fewer available OH•
 molecules. The photo activity of the catalyst increase for pH 
scale ranges of 5 to 10, and for pH 10 ( alkaline medium), proficiency is at its high￾est level because the OH•
- generated reaction with organic pollutant also degrades 
organic pollutants. Due to the extremely abundant hydroxyl radical immersion in the 
pH range of 1 1– 14, there is a decline in efficiency. They are not allowed to react with 
the dye. As a result, this pH array’s efficiency is very poor.
 [30].
The amount of catalyst directly correlates with the amount of photocatalytic 
action, that is, increasing the amount of catalyst will increase the number of free 
radicals required for degradation, which in turn will raise the rate of the chemical 
reaction. But after an optimum limit is reached, catalyst quantity doesn’t favor the 
reaction because light can’t travel through easily, therefore the majority of the cata￾lyst surfaces remain passive [31].
The rate of photocatalytic degradation increases with omissible light intensity. 
The quantum yield increases when the light power is increased. The proportion of 
response rate to absorption rate is known as quantum yield. The effectiveness of the 
response is also influenced by wavelength. The bandgap of Fe2O3 is 3.2 eV; UV light 
is absorbed by it. The degradation rate rises for the light intensity between 0 and 154 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
20 mW/cm2. This is a half- order response, meaning that the rate is dependent on the 
square root of incident light. Prior to the intermediate intensity, or 25 mW/ cm2, the 
response rate falls as the recombination of EHPs is accelerated by intense intensity 
light.
Numerous researchers have looked into how the efficiency of the photocatalytic 
rate depends on response temperature. Due to an increase in the rate of electron 
and hole recombination and then a drop in the absorption rate of the catalyst at this 
temperature, the reaction rate for TiO2 is reduced at 80°C. We achieve a maximum 
reaction rate of 20°C–800°C, which is the ideal temperature.
7.3 W HY MAGNETIC NPs ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR PCD?
The purpose of magnetic photocatalyst is to obtain better photocatalytic performance 
regarding to its stability and activity during the catalytic process. In general, there are 
several cases of modified photocatalysts based on physical and chemical interactions. 
Although those methods and techniques could maintain good stability, two critical 
problems occur: ( i) recycle and reuse of the photocatalyst become difficult when solid 
impurities exist in the catalytic system and ( ii) separation of photocatalyst material 
from the supernatant. Recently, the applications of MNPs photocatalysts have been 
proposed, which could effectively solve those a bove- mentioned problems. First, the 
magnetic material could be easily separated by applying an external magnetic field. 
Thus, recycling and reuse could be simplified and be conducted for several cycles 
without influencing the process, while the cost is also slowed down ( Figure 7.6).
7.4 PHOTOCATALYTIC ACTIVITY OF FUNCTIONALIZED 
MAGNETIC IRON OXIDE AT NANOSCALE
The researcher has tried to shrink the size of photocatalytic materials and then also 
improve the photocatalytic capabilities of these materials by manufacturing photo￾catalysts in a nanoscale powder form. The surface area plays a significant role in 
influencing the photocatalytic activity of materials. To explore the magnetic and 
photocatalytic properties of uniformly sized α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles, S Yang et al. 
FIGURE 7.6 Schematic separation of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles by magnetic.Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Applications 155
produced α-Fe2O3 hydrothermally; in comparison to powders with larger crystal￾lite sizes, α-Fe2O3 powders with lesser crystallite sizes exhibit the best photocata￾lytic degradation proficiency. Furthermore, compared to Degussa P25, which is 
readily available commercially, all of the compounds demonstrated greater dye 
degradation efficiency. Powders of nanostructured α-Fe2O3 measuring 25–55 nm in
size [32]. Hydrogen sulfide ( H2S) gas was broken down using the photocatalytic 
activity of the synthetic material by Apte et al. The necked structures of α-Fe2O3
showed good photocatalytic abilities and H2 generation. By thermal dehydration, 
Zhou et al. produced nanorods of α-Fe2O3 and compared their photocatalytic activ￾ity to that of micro- rods. According to scientists, na no- dimensional α-Fe2O3
degrades Rhodamine B ( RhB) more quickly than the matching micron- size rods. 
One of the main explanations for the increased photocatalytic activity was sug￾gested to be a higher Fe- O bond stretching frequency. Another important aspect 
that affects a material’s ability to operate as a photocatalyst is the size, composi￾tion, porosity, then local structures of particles [33]. Troy et al. examined the pho￾tocatalytic activity of three distinct types of bulk ( crystallite size 120 nm), 
ultrasonicated ( crystallite size 40 nm), and nano α -Fe2O3 powders ( crystallite size 
5.4 nm). They discovered that the rate of oxygen evolutions increases as crystallite 
size decreases, with α-Fe2O3 nano- powders reporting the greatest rate ( 1072 mol/ 
g). Because the hole diffusion length in α-Fe2O3 nano- powders is equivalent to the 
crystallite size, there are more holes available for water- reactive reactions [34]. Jin 
et al. reported the impact on the catalytic characteristics of calcination tempera￾ture, reaction temperature, catalyst quantity, also reaction time. According to their 
findings, photocatalytic activity increases with raising calcination temperature, 
reaction temperature as well as cat alytic- quantity up to a point before declining 
[35]. Additionally, similar results were reported by W Dong; for α-Fe2O3 nanopar￾ticles produced using the sol- gel method and then heated at various calcination 
temperatures. The efficiency of the catalyst was examined for a number of experi￾mental factors, including calcination temperature, pH, light intensity, and dye also 
catalyst concentration. The maximum photocatalytic activity can be observed in 
samples that have been calcined at 600°C due to the creation of the more prevalent 
α-Fe2O3 phase. The reaction at higher pH settings demonstrated superior photo￾catalytic characteristics, according to an analysis of the photocatalytic properties 
for the pH range of 3 to 10. Electrostatic abstractive properties among negatively 
charged surfaces of α-Fe2O3 also cationic malachite green dye increase at basic pH 
settings, favoring the formation of the OH•
 radical and increasing the likelihood of 
dye degradation. The photocatalytic properties of α-Fe2O3 are linearly influenced 
by light intensity since there are more photons available for reaction. Additionally, 
similar results were investigated by Liu et al. for nanorods made of α-Fe2O3. The 
authors looked at the influence of initial dye concentration as well as catalyst con￾centration on photocatalytic characteristics. According to studies, 50 mg/ L of cata￾lyst is the ideal concentration to obtain the greatest photocatalytic activity. However, 
as dye concentration rises, the photocatalytic activity declines. After a certain 
value, this effect was explained by a decrease in transparency with an increase in 
dye and then catalyst concentration. The catalyst porosity significantly contributes 
to the photocatalytic properties of a photoreaction [36]. Sundarmurthy et al. study 156 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
the photocatalytic characteristics, electrospun 1 - dimensional Fe2O3 nanobraids and 
nanoporous structures created. The nanostructures display enhanced photocata￾lytic activity for CR degradation in a short amount of time because of their porous 
surface and nano- sized crystallites of α -Fe2O3, which offer more active catalytic 
centers and allow efficient interaction between organic dye and α -Fe2O3 [37]. 
Porous structures made of Fe2O3 were reported by Zhang et al. also photocatalytic 
activity was analyzed by degradation of methylene blue ( MB). They examined the 
impact of catalyst concentration also porosity on photocatalytic activity. According 
to reports, the optimal amount of catalyst ( 20 mg) is needed to achieve the highest 
rate of MB degradation; using fewer or additional catalysts results in lessened pho￾tocatalytic activity. Smaller illumination is the result of using more catalysts, and 
when there aren’t enough active sites to break down the organic dye, there aren’t 
enough active sites either [38]. Geng et al. followed a Ni+2/ surfactant system method 
to create porous and rough- surfaced α-Fe2O3, which exhibits superior photocata￾lytic capabilities than α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles in the destruction of MB due to their 
greater surface area [39]. Mishra et al; Fe2O3 micro/nano-spheres that have been
generated using hydrothermal synthesis and thermal treatment. The dye degrada￾tion efficiency of the micro/ nano- spheres is higher than that of nano- powders. The 
calculated response rate for spherical structures is more than twice that of nano- 
 powders and 12 times that of powders with a particle size of less than one micron. 
The greater specific surface area also porous structure are responsible for improved 
photocatalytic activity. Bharathi et al; investigated a correlation between the pho￾tocatalytic activity of α-Fe2O3 and its surface shape. RhB degradation in presence 
of the catalyst was used to assess the photocatalytic activity of α-Fe2O3 nanostruc￾tures of various morphologies, including micro flowers, nanospindles, nanoparti￾cles, and nanorhombohedra. The samples with the highest surface area and porosity 
showed the best photocatalytic activity [40]. Additionally, similar surface area 
influences were investigated by Cheng et  al; for flower- like biphasic interfacial 
reaction-produced α-Fe2O3 nanostructures. RhB degradation was used to measure 
the photocatalytic abilities of α-Fe2O3. Nano- flowers were discovered to have better 
photocatalytic properties than commercial α-Fe2O3 powders when findings were 
compared. According to the result of other authors for TiO2 and Fe2O3, the augmen￾tation was associated with an increase in crystallinity also surface area [41]. 
Additionally, similar surface area influences were investigated by Cao et al. [42], 
and Lili et al. [43] synthesized hollow microspheres of Fe2O3 by solvothermal as 
well as hydrothermal method for the breakdown of salicylic acid was used to gauge 
the photocatalytic activity. In comparison to α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles, hollow spheres 
linked with nanosheets exhibit greater photocatalytic activity. The same outcomes 
were also reported by Wei et al.; Due to their greater surface area, α-Fe2O3 powder 
made at 500°C exhibit stronger photocatalytic activity for the degradation of rose 
Bengal dye than powders prepared at 600°C and commercially available TiO2
( Degussa- 25) [44]. Hollow spindles and spheres made of Fe2O3 prepared by Wei 
et al. [45] and Xu et al. [46], correspondingly. These authors noted that an increase 
in specific surface area, which exposes more unsaturated surface coordination sites 
to solution, managed to an improvement in photocatalytic degradation efficiency. 
More electron– hole transport is made possible by the hollow microsphere, which Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Applications 157
also slows down recombination. Hollow microspheres enable various visible light 
reflections within the interior, which promotes more effective utilization of the 
light source and improves light harvesting, increasing the amount of OH•
 that is 
accessible to take part in photocatalytic reactions. Additionally, the hollow spheres 
offer the dye molecules optimal routes and raise the likelihood of contact. In addi￾tion to crystallite size, crystallite orientation has a significant impact on the devel￾opment of photocatalytic capabilities. This effect has been stated by Wei et al. [47] 
who produced α-Fe2O3 nanocubes using a solvothermal process and described that 
the samples with ( 104) planes had a stronger photocatalytic property than those 
with ( 012) planes. Fenton’s reaction plays a role in the photocatalytic qualities. The 
Fenton reaction, which produces hydroxyl radicals ( OH•
) when Fe3+ is reduced to 
Fe2+, depends heavily on the the amount of Fe3+ on the catalyst’s surface. It has 
been stated by Lv et al.; specifies the exposed Fe3+ ion density in the ( 104) planes 
of α-Fe2O3 is 10.3 atoms/ nm2, while the exposed Fe3+ ion density in ( 012) planes is 
7.33 atoms/nm2. This explains why ( 104) planes react more quickly than ( 012) 
planes. Oxygen pressure and catalyst quantity, in addition to surface shape, are 
important factors in improving the photocatalytic capabilities [48]. Isaev et  al. 
stated up to a certain point, there was an increase in photocatalytic activity with an 
increase in the amount of Fe2O3, but after that, the photocatalytic activity dropped. 
Similar to this, the scientists noted that higher oxygen levels accelerated dye break￾down. The creation of extra oxygen- containing active species, such as OH•
, O2, 
also H2O oxidizing species, is what causes the improvement in photocatalytic 
behavior [49].
7.5 C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
Nanotechnology provides a cost- effective solution to cleanse water while also low￾ering overall expenses by removing hazardous and undesired pollutants. Several 
studies have been conducted that show versatile NPs can remove multiple pollut￾ants in water at the same time. This study sought to eradicate inorganic chemicals, 
and environmental toxins from wastewater by using FMNPs. An advanced effort in 
the future is required to initiate the metal oxide reaction in visible light. Population 
increase, along with rapid resource consumption also continuous industrial and 
agricultural progress has resulted in surplus effluent with integrative changes, tex￾ture, perniciousness, also harmfulness owing to various types of pollutants found 
in wastewater. Because of inherent nanoscale dimensions, the internalization of 
nanomaterials for remedy of decontamination and toxins brings large benefits, such 
as the ability to stimulate information at atomic solvents, improve inferior signal 
charges, accelerate reception times, and incessantly influence changes. Developing 
nanoscale instruments for an environmentally friendly atmosphere necessitates tech￾nical advancements in recognizing and differentiating processes and configurations 
for future rising requirements. The development of novel photocatalysts with favored 
properties to promote the oxidization process of constitutive substrates or decrease 
of pollutants under visible light irradiation should be accelerated. Currently, chal￾lenges associated with wastewater management are primarily related to the complex￾ity of the wastewater structure, which causes inconveniences in handling progress 158 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
by requiring distinct equipment and advanced technologies, resulting in longer treat￾ment periods as well as higher working expenses.

8.1 INTRODUCTION
Water scarcity, energy demand, and increasing CO2 concentration in the atmo￾sphere are critical global challenges for the next decade, and researchers are being 
directed to address these environmental issues in a scientific and eco- friendly man￾ner ( Malakootian et al. 2019; Mehdizadeh et al. 2020; Atrak, Ramazani, and Taghavi 
Fardood 2018; Adarsha et al. 2021). Increasing human needs lead to the industries 
such as textile, plastic, food, cosmetics, and paper to produce a large amount of 
dye wastewater annually ( Helmiyati et  al. 2022; Madhukara Naik, Bhojya Naik, 
Nagaraju, Vinuth, Raja Naika, et al. 2019). Industrial dyes are highly toxic and tough 
to degrade naturally, and they affect the soil and plant’s ability to photosynthesize. 
Various methods have been used in the past to remove colors and hazardous com￾pounds from the industrial effluents ( Lohrasbi et  al. 2019; Helmiyati et  al. 2022; 
Atrak, Ramazani, and Taghavi Fardood 2019). Photocatalysis is one of the advanced 
oxidation processes that can convert solar energy into chemical and electrical energy 
with the aid of strong radicals ( OH and O2) ( Somanathan et al. 2019; Mehdizadeh 
et al. 2020). During the photocatalytic process, a light photon is absorbed by the 
semiconductor when the wavelength of the light is equal to or greater than equal to 
the band gap. The electron– hole pair is created in the valence and conduction band of 
the semiconductor. Photoexcited electrons and holes undergo a redox reaction at the 
surface of photocatalytic material and degrade the organic dye from the wastewater 
and also convert H2O, CO2, and N2 into the organic fuels such as H2 and CH4 (Irshad
et al. 2022). Nanomaterials with semiconducting property that have an advantage 
such as a high surface- to- volume ratio ( Shaker Ardakani et al. 2021) produce more 
charge carriers and light absorption, etc. Nanomaterials are more effective at elimi￾nating the dye from the industrial waste than the bulk metal oxide semiconductor 
( Sarkar, Sarkar, and Bhattacharjee 2019; Kamaraj et al. 2019).
Metal oxide semiconductor ( ZnO, TiO2, SrTiO3, etc.) and metal ( Ag, Au, Pd, etc.) 
 nano- photocatalysts have photocatalytic activity in the presence of the UV region, 
and are nontoxic, wide band gap, economical and chemically stable ( Surendra 2018; 
Indriyani et al. 2021). These semiconducting nanomaterials show better photocata￾lytic performance and photocorrosion resistance. However, ( i) The rapid recombina￾tion of the photoexcited charge carrier ( Indriyani et al. 2021), ( ii) Separation of the 
photocatalysts after the degradation studies from the reaction mixture ( Malakootian 
et al. 2019) and ( iii) Utilization of the complete solar spectrum are being the major 
challenges in employing these na no- photocatalysts for real time applications. To 
address the aforementioned challenge, magnetic nanomaterials ( MNs) such as Fe3O4, 
FeO, Fe2O3 ( Madubuonu et al. 2019), M Fe2O4 (M= Ni, Mg, Zn, Co, etc.) ( Atrak, 
Ramazani, and Taghavi Fardood 2019), and M FeO3 (M= Bi, Mn, Tb, etc.) ( Abdul 
Satar et al. 2019) have gained more attention among researchers in recent years due 
to their superior properties: photoresponse in the UV and visible range, magneti￾cally recoverable, and ability to reuse. They are used in various applications such as 
dye degradation, water splitting, removal of heavy metals, and antibiotics ( Indriyani 
et al. 2021; Vasantharaj et al. 2019). The performance of the magnetic photocatalyst 
is unsatisfactory due to its stability and fast recombination of the charge carrier. 
Functionalization is one method for improving the stability and performance of the Recent Progress in Green Synthesis 163
photocatalysts, and it can be applied to increase more surface- active sites and also 
to control the morphology and electronic and optical properties of the materials. 
Synthesis strategies for functionalizing the magnetic nanomaterials include cova￾lent and noncovalent interactions, ligand exchange, and in situ surface engineering 
( defect engineering, doping, heteroatom incorporation) ( John, Nair, and Vinod 2021; 
Kumar and Sinha Ray 2018; Bhatia et al. 2021). So far, various conventional syn￾thesis techniques such as coprecipitation, microemulsion, thermal decomposition, 
solvothermal, and chemical reduction are used to prepare magnetic nanoparticles 
(F araji, Yamini, and Rezaee 2010; Somanathan et al. 2019). However, harmful chem￾icals are used as reducing agents, capping agents, and surfactants to prepare the 
magnetic nanoparticle by chemical and physical methods, which affect the human 
health and environment. Green synthesis is one of the best alternatives to conven￾tional synthesis methods to overcome these issues. The green synthesis method is 
economical, nontoxic, eco- friendly, and biocompatible and also the source used for 
preparing the nanomaterial is renewable to control the various parameters of the 
materials during synthesis (V asantharaj et al. 2019; Madubuonu et al. 2019; Qasim 
et al. 2020; Bishnoi, Kumar, and Selvaraj 2018). Biological sources such as micro￾organisms ( bacteria, yeast, fungi, algae) and plant extracts ( leaf, fruit, stem, seed, 
peel) ( Indriyani et al. 2021) are used in green synthesis methods as reducing agents, 
capping agents, surfactants, and stabilizing agents to replace the toxic chemicals 
NaOH, NH4OH, and KOH (B huiyan et al. 2020; Abid and Kadhim 2020; Indriyani 
et  al. 2021). Biosynthesis (us ing microorganisms) and phytosynthesis ( using plant 
extracts) are the two roots of the green synthesis method for preparing nanoma￾terials. Functionalization of green- synthesized magnetic nanoparticles shows the 
desired particle size, better photocatalytic performance in the visible region, shorter 
degradation time, and easy recoverability ( Surendra 2018; Abdul Satar et al. 2019; 
Atrak, Ramazani, and Taghavi Fardood 2018).
This chapter focuses on the various synthesis methods of green- synthesized mag￾netic particles including hydrothermal method, sol- gel method, microwave- assisted 
synthesis, and biosynthesis methods. Also, various synthesis strategies, various plant 
extracts, and functionalization of MNs ( by forming metal nanocomposite, metal 
oxide nanocomposite, and carbon- based nanocomposite) and their photocatalytic 
applications have been summarized.
8.2 GREEN SYNTHESIS
The alternative choice to physical and wet chemical synthesis for the preparation 
of nanomaterials is green synthesis and it is a nontoxic, eco- friendly, cost- effective 
and renewable process. During this synthesis method, metal salts and plant extracts 
or microorganisms are used as precursors and reducing agents. Various parameters 
such as morphology, structure, size, and properties of materials depend on the con￾centration of precursors and reducing agent, temperature, and pH at the time of the 
synthesis process. Various types of nanoparticle synthesis and green synthesis meth￾ods are shown in F igures 8.1 and 8.2. In general, biosynthesis and photosynthesis 
are the two types of green synthesis processes used to prepare the nanomaterial. The 
plant extract aided synthesis process is facile and most preferable because microbial 
 164 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
cell culture is required and the biohazard problem for the biosynthesis method is not 
present ( Pal, Rai, and Pandey 2019). Plant extract consists of phytochemicals like 
proteins, carbohydrates, glucose, polyphenols, terpenoids, etc., which are used to 
reduce and stabilize the metal precursor into a metal ion during the synthesis process 
( Lohrasbi et al. 2019; Liaskovska et al. 2019; Sarkar, Sarkar, and Bhattacharjee 2019; 
Vasantharaj et al. 2019; Bhuiyan et al. 2020) ( Figures 8.1 and 8.2).

8.3 MAGNETIC NANOMATERIAL AS PHOTOCATALYST
In photocatalytic degradation, recovery and recyclability of nano semiconductor 
photocatalyst after the completion of reaction are the challenging tasks. Figure 8.3. 
shows several forms iron oxide nanomaterials such as magnetite ( Fe3O4), maghemite 
(γ-Fe2O3 and β-Fe2O3), hematite (α-Fe2O3), and Ferrites ( MFe2O4, M = Mn, Ba and 
Ni) materials having magnetic properties, a larger active surface area, good chemical 
stability, are nontoxic, are active in UV and visible light spectrum range, are easily 
recoverable and reusable ( Malakootian et al. 2019; Vasantharaj et al. 2019; Arularasu, 
Devakumar, and Rajendran 2018; Roy, Das, and Dhar 2021). Magnetic nanoparti￾cles are used in the application of magnetic drug delivery, sensors, catalysis, tissue 
repair, and magnetic storage media ( Hedayati, Joulaei, and Ghanbari 2020; Shaker 
Ardakani et al. 2021; Saeid Taghavi Fardood, Farzaneh Moradnia, Miad Mostafaei, 
Zolfa Afshari, Vahid Faramarzi 2019). Jianmin Gu et al. reported single crystalline 
α-Fe2O3 with hierarchical structures ( micro- pine, snowflake and bundle) prepared by 
hydrothermal method and shows good photocatalytic properties of degradation of 
FIGURE 8.3 Various types of magnetic nanoparticles.166 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
salicyclic acid ( Gu et al. 2009). Khedr has prepared nano sized iron oxide material by 
thermal evaporation and coprecipitation method. Prepared iron oxides with different 
average crystallite size of 35, 100, and 150 nm were found to completely decompose 
the Congo red dye. The degradation rate of Congo red dye with respect to the particle 
was observed to be in the order of 35 nm > 150 nm > 100 nm. Degradation decreases 
at a particle size of 100 nm as large number of b y- products are attached to the sur￾face of the material ( Khedr, Abdel Halim, and Soliman 2009). Mishra et al. have 
reported poor photocatalytic activity of iron oxide magnetic semiconductor due to a 
fast electron– hole recombination rate and they were found to be less stable due to low 
bandgap energy and easy aggregation ( Mishra, Patnaik, and Parida 2019; Mamba 
and Mishra 2016).
8.4 GREEN SYNTHESIS OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
The synthesis of magnetic nanoparticle carried out with different synthesis routes is 
shown in Figure 8.4.
8.4.1 biosynthesis Method
N.S. Abdul Satar et al. have used facile green synthesis route for the fabrication of 
yttrium (Y)-doped BiFeO3 nanoparticle using κ- carrageenan seaweed as a biotem￾plate for photodegradation of methylene blue ( MB). Doping with yttrium BiFeO3 was 
found to decrease the grain size and also increase surface area compared to undoped 
nanoparticle ( Abdul Satar et al. 2019). K.D. Sirdeshpande et al. have reported the 
preparation of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticle using Calliandra haematocephala leaf 
extract as a reducing agent for degradation of malachite green dye under sunlight 
irradiation. Larger specific surface area and mesoporous structure with a pore radius 
of 34.18 A° observed from Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis were attributed 
to the photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalysts ( Sirdeshpande et  al. 
2018). FeO nanoparticle was developed by Kamaraj et al., using iron nitrate, sodium 
FIGURE  8.4 (a) Coprecipitation, (b) combustion, (c) microwave-assisted combustion, (d) 
hydrothermal method ( Noroozifar, Yousefi, and Jahani 2013; Cristiani et al. 2013; Hayashi 
and Hakuta 2010; Zhong et al. 2017).Recent Progress in Green Synthesis 167
hydroxide, and avocado fruit extract, and the prepared catalyst was tested for the deg￾radation of various organic dye solutions under direct sunlight irradiation ( Kamaraj 
et  al. 2019). N. Madubuonua et  al. prepared FeO magnetic nanoparticle for anti- 
 bacterial and photodegradation of dye solution using iron chloride and composition 
of leaf extracts of Psidium guajava–Moringa oleifera, which served as a reducing 
and capping agent for the iron oxide preparation ( Madubuonu et al. 2019). Daphne 
mezereum leaf extract was used as reducing and stabilizing agents for the preparation 
of FeO magnetic nanoparticle without any additional reducing agent ( Beheshtkhoo 
et al. 2018).
8.4.2 CheMiCal reduCtion and CopreCipitation Method
Coprecipitation method provides inexpensive, easy control on particle size and com￾position, high purity, and high yield product of nanoparticle ( Noroozifar, Yousefi, and 
Jahani 2013; Cristiani et al. 2013). Md.S.H. Bhuiyan et al. prepared α-Fe2O3 nanopar￾ticles by using leaf extract of papaya plant and its photocatalytic efficiency for the 
degradation of remazol yellow RR was studied. The plant extract contains phyto￾chemicals such as flavonoids, glycosides, and polyphenols, which act as reducing 
and stabilizing agent and react with the Fe ions and produce iron oxide nanoparticle. 
The functional group present in the α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and papaya plant extract 
was confirmed by FITR analysis ( Bhuiyan et al. 2020). Synthesis of Fe2O3 and FeO 
nanoparticle by using henna leaf extract by the chemical reduction method with and 
without pulsed laser ablation ( PLA) was reported by M.A. Abid and D.A. Kadhim. 
Presence of gallic acid, hydroxyl, and lawsone ( 2- hydroxy 1, 4- naphthoquinone) 
groups in the henna extract may be the reasons for the reduction process in the iron 
precursor to produce Fe2O3 nanoparticles. During the PLA process, the prepared 
Fe2O3 nanoparticles were changed into the formation of FeO nanoparticle. Fe2O3
nanoparticle shows the wurtzite structure and PLA processed FeO shows the cubic 
structure in the XRD analysis. The bandgap range of Fe2O3 and FeO nanoparticle 
was found to be 2.75 eV and 3.3eV ( Abid and Kadhim 2020). Iron oxide nanorods 
were prepared using iron chloride precursors with Withania coagulans fruit extract 
as a reducing and capping agent, and they were also compared with chemical method 
using iron chloride, Na2SO3, and ammonia as the precursors ( Qasim et al. 2020). 
Even though this method has many advantages, it needs continuous washing, drying, 
and high- temperature calcination to eliminate the impurity phases.
8.4.3 sol- gel Method
Metal oxide nanoparticles and their composites were prepared by s ol- gel method 
with desire texture and surface property at low- temperature process ( Karahroudi, 
Hedayati, and Goodarzi 2020; Chislova et al. 2011; Kumar et al. 2017). Indriyani 
et  al. synthesized BiFeO3 nanoparticle using Abelmoschus esculentus leaf extract 
for photodegradation of MB under sunlight irradiation. The secondary metabolite 
flavonoids and saponins in the A. esculentus act as a capping agent to provide uni￾form shape and grain size during the formation of nanoparticle. The photocatalytic 
activity tests were performed under various catalyst dosages 10, 15, and 20 mg for 168 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
MB degradation, and the catalyst with 15 mg of dosage was observed to be 94.04% 
degradation under the visible light irradiation. Below and above the 15 mg of catalyst 
dosages, photocatalytic activity was less due to the low active site in the dosage of 
10 mg and also due to the higher concentration of catalyst in the dosage of 20 mg. The 
stability and recyclability of prepared nanoparticle revealed 90.20% after the four 
cycles of degradation of MB under visible light, and in each cycle, a small amount 
of catalyst loss was observed due to loss of mass of catalyst during the reproduc￾tion (Indriyani et  al. 2021). Mg–Ni–Al–Fe2O4 was synthesized by sol- gel method 
using tragacanth gel with different dosages of Al concentration for the degradation of 
Direct Blue129 dye under visible light irradiation. Bandgap of the Mg0.5Ni0.5AlxFe2- 
xO4 magnetic nanoparticle increases and crystallite size decreases with increasing 
concentration of Al ions ( Atrak, Ramazani, and Taghavi Fardood 2019). SrFe12O19– 
SrTiO3 nanocomposite was prepared by a uto- combustion sol- gel method using lemon 
juice as gelling and capping agent. SrFe12O19 and SrTiO3 nanoparticle shows agglom￾eration without calcination. Due to calcination at 850°C and 500°C, agglomeration 
was reduced. SrFe12O19 and SrTiO3 nanoparticle exhibited needle shape and spherical 
shape. Composition of SrFe12O19-SrTiO3 shows needle and plane shapes ( Karahroudi, 
Hedayati, and Goodarzi 2020). Hence, in sol- gel method, it is possible to change the 
size, shape, and particle distribution of magnetic nanoparticle prepared by varying 
the pH, processing time, temperature, and solvent during the synthesis process.
8.4.4 hydrotherMal Method
The hydrothermal method provides high crystallinity and controlled particle size 
under the high pressure at a mild temperature. In general, metal precursors are 
mixed with solvent until a homogeneous solution is obtained and then the solution 
is transferred into an autoclave and kept in the hot air oven or furnace for some time 
( Hayashi and Hakuta 2010). There is only one report found on green synthesis of 
magnetic nanohybrid ZnFe2O4. Krishnan et al. synthesized ZnFe2O4 by using metal 
nitrate, GO powder, and orange peel extract as a natural surfactant. They have found 
a photocatalytic efficiency of 92.4% for MB degradation ( Krishnan et al. 2021).
8.4.5 CoMbustion Method
Synthesis of the magnetic nanoparticle by combustion method is a rapid wet chemi￾cal synthesis and exothermic reaction process. In this method, preheating and addi￾tional calcination processes are not required ( Das and Kandimalla 2017). CaFe2O4
nanoparticle was prepared by combustion method using lemon juice as a capping 
agent ( Adarsha et al. 2021). The prepared nanocatalyst has an orthorhombic phase 
with a grain size of 30 nm and porous with a lot of voids in the structure, which leads 
to high surface area and chemical reactivity and avoids aggregation CoFe2O4, and 
Zn-doped CoFe2O4 was prepared using curd as reducing agent ( Madhukara Naik, 
Bhojya Naik, Nagaraju, Vinuth, Vinu, et al. 2019). A g- doped CuFe2O4 nanoparticles 
were synthesized using an extract of jatropha oil by combustion method for decom￾position of malachite green dye under U V- light irradiation. The prepared A g- doped 
CuFe2O4 nanoparticles exhibited improved photocatalytic efficiency and reusability Recent Progress in Green Synthesis 169
( Surendra 2018). Arularasu et al. prepared Fe3O4 nanoparticle by the hotplate com￾bustion method using Kappaphycus alvarezii seaweed plant extract as a stabilizer to 
study the degradation of cationic textile dye waste. Prepared magnetic nanoparticle 
shows ferromagnetic and is mesoporous in nature with a particle size range of 10– 
 30 nm ( Arularasu, Devakumar, and Rajendran 2018). Surendra et al. have reported the 
preparation of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticle via combustion method using jatropha oil extract 
and metal nitrate precursors for the photocatalytic application. The prepared magnetic 
nanoparticle has porous flakes with agglomeration structure in nature. The agglom￾eration occurs because of fatty acids present in the oil extract, which coordinates with 
Zn ion and forms a complex network with hydroxyl groups ( Surendra et al. 2020).
8.4.6 MiCrowave- assisted Method
 Microwave- assisted combustion method is another facile and rapid preparation 
method for synthesizing nanoparticles, and advantage of this method is no need for 
additional high- temperature calcination after the synthesis step ( Zhong et al. 2017). 
Somanathana et  al. reported Ce- incorporated NiFe2O4 magnetic nanoflakes using 
Calotropis gigantean plant leaf extract for the removal of MB dye effectively. C. 
gigantean plant leaf extract acts as a natural reducing and capping agent at the time of 
the synthesis process to reduce the metal nitrate to form the Ce- incorporated NiFe2O4
nanoflakes ( Somanathan et al. 2019). ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles were prepared through 
a microwave- assisted method by Madhukara Naik et al., using Limonia acidissima
juice extract as reducing agent and metal precursors. Uniform particle distribution 
with agglomeration was noticed in the SEM micrograph. But, agglomeration was 
found in the SEM images, due to the high energy produced by the microwave oven at 
the time of synthesis ( Madhukara Naik, Bhojya Naik, Nagaraju, Vinuth, Raja Naika, 
et al. 2019).
8.4.7 soniCation Method
The advantage of sonication method is, while using the ultrasonic wave, the metal 
precursors and surfactants are mixed well, and then after the calcination, desired 
structure of nanoparticle can be easily obtained ( Alizadeh, Fallah, and Nikazar 
2019). TbFeO3 magnetic nanoparticle was prepared by Mehdizadeh et al., using vari￾ous synthetic ( sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide 
( CTAB)) and natural surfactants ( cherry and orange juices) via ultrasonication method. 
Orange juice used TbFeO3 nanoparticle has high crystallinity and no impurity peak 
was observed from XRD pattern. Uniform particle distribution was occurred while 
using CTAB and orange juice as shown in the SEM image ( Figure 8.5). Compared 
with other surfactants, orange juice used TbFeO3 nanoparticle has smaller particle 
size ( Mehdizadeh et al. 2020).
8.5 FUNCTIONALIZATION OF MAGNETIC NANOMATERIALS
Functionalization is a process in which functional groups ( carboxylic, hydroxyl, and 
amine groups) and active sites can be created on the surface of the nanomaterials at 170 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
FIGURE 8.5 SEM images of TbFeO3 nanostructures prepared by using (a ) sodium dodecyl 
sulfate, ( b) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, (c ) cherry juice, and ( d) orange juice as surfac￾tant. Adopted with the permission ( Mehdizadeh et al. 2020). Copyright 2020, Elsevier.
the time of synthesis. Synthesis of functionalized magnetic nanoparticle by various 
strategies is shown in F igure 8.6 and the various methods are as follows:
• Covalent Interaction: Formation of covalent band on the surface of the 
nanoparticle during the chemical reactions.
• Noncovalent Interaction: Hydrophobic, electrostatic interaction on the sur￾face of the nanoparticle during the chemical reactions.
• Ligand Exchange: Polymers or organic molecules attached to the surface 
of the nanoparticle to control the nanoparticle size, shape, and enrich their 
properties.
• In situ surface modification: incorporation of heteroatom and defect for￾mation on the crystal structure of the nanoparticle ( Kumar and Sinha Ray 
2018; Bhatia et al. 2021; Sneharani and Byrappa 2021). Among the various Recent Progress in Green Synthesis 171
FIGURE 8.6 Various strategies of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles synthesis ( Kumar 
and Sinha Ray 2018; Bhatia et al. 2021; Sneharani and Byrappa 2021)
strategies, in situ surface modifications are widely preferred for preparation 
of functionalized magnetic nanoparticle by green synthesis method.
8.5.1 M etal nanoCoMposite
Doping and incorporating with various metals ions are important functionalization 
strategies for enhancing the optical and electrical properties of magnetic nanopar￾ticles. Doping and incorporation of metals such as N, S, P, and O deviate the band 
length and angle, which help to provide more active sites on the surface of the nano￾materials ( Kumar and Sinha Ray 2018). There are several reports on increasing the 
optical and photocatalytic efficiency of the magnetic nanoparticle photocatalyst 
by doping and forming nanocomposite with the metal atoms. From Figure 8.7, 1% 
Y-doped BiFeO3 has smaller particle size, which contributes large surface- active 
sites. They have noticed that the crystallite size of both undoped and Y - doped 
( with different concentrations of Y) BiFeO3 nanoparticles is almost similar for 
all the samples, but the band gap was found to be decreased with increasing the 
concentration of dopant ( Abdul Satar et al. 2019). In the case of Z n- doped CoFe2O4172 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
prepared with curd as a reducing agent, it was discovered that the lattice param￾eter and peak shift increased as the concentration of Zn was increased ( Zn = 0.0, 
0.2, 0.4, and 0.6). F igure 8.8 depicts the XRD pattern of CoFe2O4 together with 
Zn-doped CoFe2O4. The reason for the shift in lattice parameter and peak posi￾tion is because Zn2+ has a greater ionic radius than Co2+ (M adhukara Naik, Bhojya 
Naik, Nagaraju, Vinuth, Vinu, et al. 2019). Surendra et al. were able to synthesize 
Ag-doped CuFe2O4 nanoparticles using jatropha oil extract as a starting material. 
Compared with the XRD pattern of bare CuFe2O4, the XRD pattern of A g- doped 
CuFe2O4 nanoparticle shows two additional peaks corresponding to crystal planes 
( 311) and ( 440), which are attributed to doping of Ag in CuFe2O4. Also, CuFe2O4
particle exhibited porous flakes with agglomeration and Ag CuFe2O4 nanoparticle 
showed spherical- shaped agglomeration with numerous trapped pores. The band 
gaps, calculated from diffuse reflectance spectra, of prepared CuFe2O4 and Ag￾doped CuFe2O4 nanoparticles were 2.15 and 1.6 eV, respectively. Also, they have

concluded that the bandgap of A g- doped CuFe2O4 decreases with increase in dop￾ing concentration (S urendra 2018).
Atrak et al. have investigated preparation of A l- d oped MgNiFe2O4 magnetic 
nanoparticles with different dosage concentrations of Al ( x= 0.5,1, 1,5) and its 
photocatalytic degradation ability for the degradation of dye solution using traga￾canth gel as natural reducing agent. In their studies, they have found that while 
increasing the Al doping concentration, the XRD diffraction peaks were broad￾ening due to decrease in crystallite size of prepared nanoparticles. They have also 
reported that bandgap of MgNiFe2O4 was found to increase with respect to doping 
concentration (A trak, Ramazani, and Taghavi Fardood 2019). Somanathan et al. 
have incorporated Ce ions on the NiFe2O4 and they found that the incorporation 
contributes to more active sites on the surface of the photocatalysts, and also, 
they have found that the electron– hole recombination rate is reduced. The surface 
morphology of the magnetic C e- incorporated NiFe2O4 photocatalysts exhibits 
fl akes- like structure with agglomeration because of magnetic dipole interac￾tion between magnetic nanoparticles ( Somanathan et al. 2019). From the above 
observation, enhancement of photocatalytic performance of metal nanocompos￾ite because of doping of metal ion on the surface of magnetic nanomaterials can 174 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
provide more s urface- active site, improve the lifetime of charge carriers, and 
improve the light- gathering capacity due to its bandgap alignment.
8.5.2 M etal oxide nanoCoMposite
The recombination of charge carriers and performance of photocatalytic activity of 
the magnetic nanomaterials were also improved by forming the nanocomposites with 
metal oxides. In one of the metal oxide nanocomposites study, MgFe2O4@ γ–Al2O3
magnetic nanoparticles were reported without adding any additional agent, using 
tragacanth gel and metal nitrate as the precursor. γ–Al2O3 has been chosen because 
of its large surface area and high porous material. Their photocatalytic degradation 
ability for the degradation of reactive red 195 dye and reactive orange 122 dye was 
found to be reasonable. In addition to this, they have also studied recovering and 
reusability of the magnetic nanoparticle and it was found that no significant loss 
in the photocatalytic activity up to five photocatalytic measurement cycles ( Atrak, 
Ramazani, and Taghavi Fardood 2018). As of now, there are many reports avail￾able on green synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles and metal oxides nanoparticle, but 
green synthesis of magnetic nanocomposite photocatalysts is not yet much explored.
8.5.3 C arbon- based nanoCoMposite
There are very few reports on ca rbon- based magnetic nanocomposites, which were 
observed to provide high surface area, enhanced charge transportation, and tun￾able bandgap. Magnetic nanoparticle with carbon- based nanohybrid was prepared 
by Krishnan et  al. for photodegradation of organic pollutant via hydrothermal 
method. On the surface of the rGO sheets, ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles were highly dis￾persed, which results in reduction of recombination of charge carriers. The reduced 
recombination rate of photoexcited electron– hole pair was confirmed by PL spectra 
( Krishnan et al. 2021). Even though there are good number of reports available on 
 carbon- based magnetic nanophotocataysts, studies relevant to green synthesis meth￾ods are very much limited and yet to be developed.
8.6 RETRIABLE PHOTOCATALYST FOR DEGRADATION 
OF ORGANIC POLLUTANT
Photocatalysis is an advanced oxidation process for eliminating organic pollutants 
present in the industrial effluents and a good photocatalyst must possess large surface 
area, abundant surface- active sites, tunable bandgap, and better charge separation. 
Especially, bandgap is the key factor for the photocatalysis, where the absorption of 
light is of primary importance. Hence, doping with metals is one of the solution, for 
reducing the charge recombination, increasing the surface- active cites, and adjusting 
bandgap alignment, to improve the efficiency of a photocatalyst.
 Green- synthesized magnetic nanophotocatalysts such as Fe3O4, Fe2O3, FeO and 
M Fe2O4(M =Mn, Ba, and Ni), and M FeO3 (M= Bi, Sr and Tb) using various natural 
sources, their photocatalytic application for the degradation of various organic pol￾lutants, and their degradation efficacies are listed in Table 8.1.Recent Progress in Green Synthesis 175 TABLE 8.1 Summary of Reported Green- Synthesized Magnetic Nanomaterials for Photocatalytic Pollutant Degradation Reducing / Capping Agent/ S.

Abdul Satar et  al. ( 2019), Surendra ( 2018), and Somanathan et  al. ( 2019) have 
reported doping of metal ion on the surface of the magnetic nanoparticle, which was 
found to provide more surface- active sites on the surface of the catalyst. Also, they 
have observed extended lifetime of the excited charge carriers and attributed them as 
the reason for the enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to nondoped catalysts.
Sirdeshpande et al. ( 2018) and Surendra et al. ( 2020) have prepared Fe3O4 meso￾porous magnetic nanoparticle and ZnFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles and studied their 
photocatalytic dye degradation performances. In their studies, small crystallite size, 
large surface area, and morphology were attributed to the enhanced activity.
Madhukara Naik et  al. reported the preparation of Zn- doped cobalt ferrites 
(ZnxCO1-x Fe2O4) using curd as a fuel by combustion method. Lactic acids and 
carbohydrates present in the curd acts as a powerful reducing agent and they are 
responsible for the combustion process. In their studies, they have compared the 
photocatalytic activity of ZnxCO1-x Fe2O4 catalysts, with various doping ratio of 
Zn+ ions, for the degradation of Congo red and Evans blue dyes under visible light 
irradiation. They have proposed a photocatalytic mechanism for ZnxCO1-x Fe2O4 
catalyst and it is shown in Figure 8.9 ( Madhukara Naik, Bhojya Naik, Nagaraju, 
Vinuth, Vinu, et al. 2019). They have concluded that the presence of Zn+ ion dop￾ing at the Cobalt site prevents the recombination of electron– hole pairs and also 
defects formation in the energy levels, was responsible for the improved photo￾catalytic activity and better light sensitivity of the catalyst. Surendra et al. have 
reported photocatalytic decomposition of Malachite green ( MG) dye by using Ag￾doped CuFe2O4 and CuFe2O4 and its photocatalytic activity result, as shown in 
 Figure 8.10. Compared to dye decomposition ability of undoped CuFe2O4 nanopar￾ticle, almost complete decomposition was found in Ag- doped CuFe2O4 under UV 
light due to the presence of more surface- active sites, smaller particle size, and 
decreased bandgap ( Surendra 2018).
There are few reports in which the effect of the light source, catalyst dosage, ini￾tial concentration, and irradiation time on the photodegradation ability for magnetic 
nanomaterials such as Mg0.5Ni0.5AlxFe2-xO4 (x=0.5, 1, 1.5), TbFeO3, and MgFe2O4@ 
γ–Al2O3 has been investigated ( Atrak, Ramazani, and Taghavi Fardood 2019; Atrak, 
Ramazani, and Taghavi Fardood 2018; Mehdizadeh et  al. 2020). Among all the

studies, the concentration of Alx (x= 1.5) was better efficient for the degradation 
of Direct Blue 129 dye under visible light ( Atrak, Ramazani, and Taghavi Fardood 
2019). On increasing the concentration of dye solution, the photocatalytic perfor￾mance of the TbFeO3 catalyst was found to be reduced. Compared with synthetic 
surfactant SDS used TbFeO3 nanoparticle, orange juice assisted TbFeO3 nanoparti￾cle showed higher photocatalytic activity due to the smaller particle size, high purity, 
and high crystalline structure ( Mehdizadeh et al. 2020).
Decoloration of methyl orange with and without H2O2 in the dye solution was 
reported by Beheshtkhoo et al. In their studies, the addition of hydrogen peroxide to 
the FeO nanoparticle provides additional hydroxyl radical for degradation process 
and it exhibited efficient degradation compared with other solutions ( Beheshtkhoo 
et al. 2018). The photocatalytic activity of green and chemical synthesis of iron oxide 
nanorods was investigated by Qasim et al. for the degradation of safranin dye under 
the sunlight irradiation. In comparison with chemically prepared iron oxide, g reen- 
 synthesized iron oxide nanorods show enhanced rate of photocatalytic degradation 
because of the phytochemicals present in the plant extract, which has a tendency to 
increase the oxidation and reduction potential ( Qasim et al. 2020).
Formation of nanohybrid with rGO sheet on the ZnFe2O4 nanoparticle showed 
significant improvement in lifetime of the excited charge carriers and their photo￾catalytic degradation ability is found to be noticeable (K rishnan et al). Figure 8.11 
shows the photocatalytic mechanism of ZnFe2O4/ rGO nanohybrids under vis￾ible light irradiation. Krishnan et al. have observed that when ZnFe2O4/rGO was
exposed to sunlight irradiation, photogenerated electrons in the ZnFe2O4 valance 
band got excited into the conduction band of ZnFe2O4 and photogenerated electrons 
were transferred to the rGO, which reduced charge recombination. Photogenerated 
electrons in the rGO undergo the reduction reaction, and a photogenerated hole in 
the ZnFe2O4 undergoes the oxidation reaction, degrading the MB dye ( Krishnan 
et al. 2021).180 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
 
• Preparation of green synthesis of functionalized magnetic nanoparti￾cles using bio- organism and other photocatalytic applications are not yet 
explored much.
• In most of the green synthesis processes, plant extracts are used as reduc￾ing agent, capping agent, and surfactant and not used as a metal source for 
preparing magnetic nanoparticles.

nanohybrids. Adopted with the permission ( Krishnan et al. 2021). Copyright 2021 Elsevier.
Somanathan et al. and Abdul Satar et al. have investigated the stability and reus￾ability of the magnetic photocatalysts Ce-N iFe2O4 and Y-doped BiFeO3. They have 
found that after the fifth cycle, photocatalytic activity reduced slightly due to the 
decrement in active sites, absorption of contaminant, and loss of catalyst during the 
washing process ( Somanathan et al. 2019; Abdul Satar et al. 2019).
From the above reported observations, it is possible to tune properties of magnetic 
photocatalysts such as particle size, synthesis time and temperature, morphology, 
bandgap, surface-a ctive site, and catalyst dosage for improving their photocatalytic 
activity by green synthesis approach.
8.7 FUTURE SCOPE
The photocatalytic performance and stability of g reen-s ynthesized and functional￾ized magnetic nanomaterials are found to be reasonable and comparable to those of 
conventionally synthesized magnetic nanomaterials. As of now, many reports are 
available on the green synthesis of functionalized magnetic nanomaterials using 
plant extracts for dye degradation applications. However, there are a few gaps in the 
research area of green synthesis of magnetic nanophotocatalysts, and some of the 
most important gaps identified are listed below:Recent Progress in Green Synthesis 181
• Also, in some of the reports chemical reducing agents, capping agent and surfac￾tant are additionally used along with plant extracts during the synthesis process.
• Green-synthesized composite of carbon-based nanomaterial and metal 
oxide with magnetic nanoparticle for photocatalytic applications is not much 
studied yet and further investigations are needed on this above- mentioned 
research gaps.
8.8 CONCLUSION 
This chapter discusses various green synthesis methods for functionalized magnetic 
nanoparticles that use natural sources as reducing, capping, stabilizing, and surfac￾tant agents, as well as their photocatalytic activity. Compared with the conventional 
synthesis route, g reen- synthesized magnetic nanoparticles exhibit improved photo￾catalytic performance and are easily recoverable and reused for several cycles. The 
pH, synthesis temperature, calcination temperature, and incubation time affect the 
properties of the g reen- synthesized magnetic nanoparticles, and they must be care￾fully noted at the time of synthesis for better performance. Greenly synthesized and 
functionalized magnetic nanoparticles are stable and simple to recover and reuse 
for photocatalytic dye degradation applications. There are many more materials that 
need to be investigated for their suitability in green synthesis methods. Hence, fur￾ther research is needed in the field of green synthesis as well as on various function￾alization strategies.

9.1 INTRODUCTION
Modern lifestyle and booming industrialization provides us the luxury of using vari￾ous products to make our life more comfortable and easy, but it comes at a price 
namely the mass generation and erratic release of wastewater ( Xiao, Liu, and Ge 
2021). Wastewater is “ utilized water from any mix of residential, mechanical, busi￾ness or farming exercises, surface overflow or storm water, and any sewer inflow or 
sewer penetration” ( Almuktar, Abed, and Scholz 2018). Fortunately, reuse of waste￾water after treatment is one of the common strategies to control water pollution and 
conservation. The treatment process depended upon the type of wastewater and its 
innate characteristics.
Although wastewater treatment strategies are advantageous, implementation of 
sophisticated discharge standards could potentially result in the pollution burden 
shifting from aquatic environments to other ecosystems due to extensive resource 
consumption and environmental emissions ( Parra- Saldivar, Muhammad, and Iqbal 
2020). Therefore, effective decision- supported tools are being utilized to identify 
eco-friendly wastewater treatment strategies.
9.2 WASTE WATER TREATMENT STRATEGIES
Conventional wastewater treatment strategies include physical, chemical, biological, 
and sludge treatment. Utilization of a novel approach for sustainable wastewater treat￾ment still remains a major challenge. Significant efforts were made to develop novel 
techniques in the treatment of wastewater that have been contaminated with carcino￾genic dyes, heavy metals, pesticides, antibiotics, microbes, etc., Due to technological 
development, extensive research was carried out in wastewater treatment process. 
In this backdrop, utilization of nanomaterials in wastewater treatment is catalyzing 
rapid development in recent years. In this scenario, utilization of nanoparticles ( NPs)

has emerged as an efficient tool in wastewater treatment. The intrinsic properties 
like small size, large surface area and quantum effect of MNPs have paved way for 
diversified application in wastewater treatment.
Nanoparticles have been applied in various sectors like, electronics, textiles, 
energy, food, healthcare, optics, and agriculture. Recent advances in nanoremedi￾ation pave the ways in treating wastewaters in small and large- scale setups. Due 
to large surface area, nanoparticles facilitate grater absorption and high degree of 
interaction with pollutants present in the wastewater. Metal nanoparticles ( MtNPs), 
nanopolymers ( NP), nanosorbents ( NS), and nanocatalysts ( NC) have been designed 
and developed to treat different quality and quantity of wastewater.
9.3 NANOTECHNOLOGY IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT
In the 21st century developed and developing countries face a lot of problems due to 
the discharge of wastewater from the industries. Release of hazardous wastes into 
the environment without proper treatment leads to the degradation of the ecosystem. 
Food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, leather, and textile industries discharge hazardous, 
nondegradable waste into water bodies and damage aquatic life.
Hence, treatment of hazardous waste before their release is an inevitable task. 
Various physical, chemical, and biological technologies have been utilized in the 
treatment of industrial effluents ( Weng et al. 2013). However, the main impediments 
for the implementation of these technologies are high installation and operational 
costs, production of substantial amount of toxic biomass, and low treatment perfor￾mance ( Ali et al. 2017).
Effective treatment of industrial effluents is still an open challenge ( Cheera et al. 
2016). Activated carbon is utilized more frequently in conventional adsorption pro￾cess. However, the adsorption capacity is inversely proportional to the concentration 
of organic content in wastewater and reported to be substantially decreased at high 
concentration.
To fulfill the demand, nanoparticles are increasingly utilized in wastewater treat￾ment ( WWT) process. NPs are nothing but submicron moieties made of inorganic 
and organic materials, and the size of the NPs ranges from 1 to 100 nm. Because of 
the so- called “ quantum size effects”, greater permeability and high stability NPs 
are getting much research attention. Size, morphology, and different phases had an 
influence on the properties and application potential ( Figure  9.1). Further, due to 
their dynamic morphology, desired size, and high saturation potential, they can be 
efficiently employed in WWT ( Sivashankar et al. 2014).
Physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles are under extensive research. 
Particularly, the magnetic property of nanomaterial is greater than the massive 
( bulk) material. Several earlier reports illustrate that nanoparticles show differences 
in the Curie ( TC) or Neel ( TN) temperatures to that of bulk materials. Similarly, 
properties like magnetization ( per atom) and the magnetic anisotropy were reported 
to be higher in nanoparticles. Magnetic nanoparticles ( MNPs) have gained atten￾tion in various fields with the advent of nanobiotechnology. MNPs are the group of 
engineered materials that of size less than 100 nm that can be manipulated under 
the effect of an external magnetic field ( Indira and Lakshmi 2010). In furtherance, 190 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
magnetic nanomaterials are found to possess high magnetoresistance, magnetoca￾loric potential, etc. Due to the fast development and application of magnetic materi￾als in various fields, utilization of magnetic nanoparticles in wastewater treatment 
seems to be promising. The magnetic nature facilitates their easy separation and 
reuse after purification process. However, more research is requested on optimiz￾ing mass production, surface functionalization, biocompatibility, and stability of 
nanoparticles.
9.4 T YPES OF NANOMATERIALS IN 
WASTEWATER TREATMENT
Nanotechnology offers leapfrogging opportunities in next- generation water remedia￾tion process. Further, nanomaterials possess multifunctional pollution remediation 
strategies. Unique properties like high reactivity, distinct quantum, surface properties, 
FIGURE 9.1 Nanomaterial-based wastewater remediation process.Phytogenic Magnetic Nanoparticles 191
deep penetration, strong sorption, high separation efficiency, good recyclability, envi￾ronment friendliness, and easy fabrication ( Lu and Yuan 2018) facilitate the vivid 
application of nanomaterials in wastewater treatment. At present, zero- valent metal 
nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes ( CNTs), and nanocom￾posites ( Table 9.1) are extensively used in wastewater treatment.
9.5 ZERO-VALENT METAL NANOPARTICLES
Ag NPs have been extensively utilized in the treatment process as it ( silver) is 
said to be highly toxic to a wide range of microorganisms inhabiting wastewater. 
Antimicrobial efficiency of Ag NPs is not clearly illustrated. However, several theo￾ries have been put forward; for example, Ag NPs have been reported to adhere to the 
microbial cell wall and cause structural changes by increasing its permeability ( Sondi 
and Salopek- Sondi 2004). Punnoose and Mathew ( 2018) reported the degradation of 
various organic pollutants by photosynthesized silver metal nano photocatalyst.
9.6 METAL OXIDES
Metal oxide nanoparticles are used as photocatalysts, and adsorbents are used in the 
removal of heavy metal from wastewater. The most common and significant metal 
oxides are iron oxides, manganese oxides, aluminum oxides, titanium oxides, and 
silver and zinc oxides ( Ahmad et al. 2020). Metal oxide nanoparticles act as a catalyst 
in different oxidation reactions and change pollutant molecules into environmen￾tally suitable products. As metal nanoparticles are shape controlled, stable, monodis￾persed, and notable for their antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral activity, they are 
used as disinfectants ( Shao et al. 2017).
Titanium dioxide ( TiO2) is one of excellent photocatalysts due to its low cost, toxic 
free property, chemical stability, easy availability, super hydrophilic, and superoleo￾phobic ( Tan, Qiu, and Ting 2015). TiO2 is reported to exist in three states, anatase, 
rutile, and brookite. Till date, anatase is considered as an efficient nanophotocatalyst 
material. TiO2 nanomaterial generates photocatalytic reactive oxygen species and 
reported to be less toxic to human beings. Nanotubes, nanowires and nanosheets 
can be prepared with the help of TiO2 ( Ibhadon and Fitzpatrick 2013). Synthesis of 
titanium dioxide ( TiO2) is facilitated by
• Sol-gel process.
• Metal organic chemical vapor deposition ( MOCVD).
• Wet chemical synthesis by precipitation of hydroxides from salts ( Lazar, 
Varghese, and Nair 2012).
In addition to filtration, TiO2 nanowire membrane is used in photocatalytic oxi￾dation of organic contaminants. Excitation and charge separation within TiO2
nanoparticles were induced ultraviolet radiations. Since TiO2 possesses low selec￾tivity, it has the capability to degrade all kinds of contaminants ( Serra et al. 2017). 
For improving the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, metal doping has been demon￾strated and silver has attracted the attention for doping ( Ahmed et al. 2018). For

industrial applications, doping with anions is considered as suitable and much cost 
effective. Recently, doped TiO2 magnetic nanoparticles have been synthesized in a 
spinning disk reactor to achieve a feasible recovery of the nanoparticles by a mag￾netic trap ( Sacco et al. 2012).
9.7 CARBON NANOMATERIALS
Graphene ( allotrope of carbon) and carbon nanotubes ( CNTs) are used as efficient 
adsorbents in wastewater treatment process. Discovery of the first fullerene in 1985 
has opened a new horizon for the synthesis of CNTs and it was fabricated in the 
year 1991 ( Iijima 1991). Synthesis of CNTs from graphite is facilitated by laser abla￾tion, arc discharge, or by chemical vapor deposition from carbon- containing gas. 
CNTs have gained considerable interest in wastewater treatment process because of 
hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and ion exchange with 
the pollutants. Compared to granular or powder activated carbons, CNTs have high 
sorption capability. Along with removal, CNTs even have the potential to inactivate 
pathogenic bacteria. Parham et al. ( 2012) reported that the CNT filter shown yeast 
filtration.
Carbon nanotubes are open ended or capped cylindrical sheet of graphene 
with diameter less than or equal to 1 nm. CNTs possess high adsorption efficiency 
toward dichlorobenzene, ethyl benzene, Zn2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+, and other 
dyes due to the high surface area to volume ratio and abundant porous structures. 
Graphene oxides are demonstrated to have high adsorbent capacity due to their 
large specific area, electron rich environment, and their strong functional groups 
( e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl, and phenol) ( Machado et al. 2019). Surwade et al. ( 2015) 
demonstrated that nanoporous graphene function as a selective membrane for 
water desalination. Functionalized graphene oxide ( GO) with hydrophilicity and 
negative charge density has desalination potential ( Zahid et al. 2018). To improve 
the adsorption efficiency, a composite was prepared by incorporating a metal to 
that of a CNT.
9.8 HYBRID NANOMATERIALS
Hybrid nanomaterials have a wide range of applications in health and environment. 
Integration of different nanomaterials results in a new multifunctional entity ( Barsan 
et al. 2016). Compared to an individual single entity nanoparticle, additional nanopar￾ticles adhering to a scaffold improve the stability of the material and enhance the 
activity. Khaydarov, Khaydarov, and Gapurova ( 2013) incorporated photo catalytic 
functional groups with nanocarbon titanium. Under sunlight irradiation, the nano￾material has shown time dependent antimicrobial activity against E.coli.
Ahmed et  al. ( 2015) synthesized ZnO/ multi- walled CNT hybrid by dispers￾ing MWCNT into a Zn- based solution by sonication. A high concentration of the 
hybrid nanomaterial ( 4 mg mL−1) or reported to possess better antibacterial prop￾erty compared to low concentration ( 0.125 mg mL−1). Although the above-mentioned 
nanoparticles are effective for pollutants removal, disadvantage like removal of NPs 
from effluent shifts the focus toward the development of MNPs for WWT.
 Phytogenic Magnetic Nanoparticles 195
9.9 MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLE COMPOSITION
Magnetic elements present in the nanomaterial are manganese, iron, chromium, 
nickel, cobalt, gadolinium, and other chemical compounds. The most widely explored 
and used magnetic nanoparticles are magnetite and/ or maghemite, the two different 
forms of iron oxide. Superparamagnetic metal particles ( nanoscale size) have wide 
applications either as a single entity or along with different functional group. In addi￾tion, the functional group prevents the aggregation and minimizes the interaction 
of the particles. The resultant surface coated MNPs are used in different fields for 
example in medical field for drug delivery, sensors, and disease diagnosis, further 
they also used in industrial and environmental applications.
9.10 MAGNETISM
Magnetic effects are induced by movement of particles like electrons, protons, and 
charged ions. A spinning electric- charged particle creates a magnetic dipole called 
magneton ( Akbarzadeh, Samiei, and Davaran 2012). A magnetic domain refers to a 
volume of material in which all magnetons pointing in the same direction and acting 
cooperatively are separated by domain walls.
Materials are classified as diamagnetic, paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, anti￾ferromagnetic, and ferrimagnetic based on the magnetic moment orientation in a 
material/ response to an externally applied magnetic field ( Table 9.2) ( Faraji, Yamini, 
and Rezaee 2010).
9.11 SUPERPARAMAGNETISM
Ferro and ferrimagnetism properties are useful in developing permanent or hard 
magnets. But, they remain magnetized after the removal of magnetic field and forms 
reversible clumps and aggregates. An ideal NP for biological application should 
have high magnetic susceptibility ( material’s degree of magnetization in response 
to applied magnetic field x=M/ B), zero coercivity, no hysteresis, and no magnetic 
memory. By reducing the size of f erro- or ferromagnetic material ( multidomain 
materials) into superparamagnetic diameter ( single domain particle) by modern 
nanotechnology techniques, the MNPs are able to return quickly to nonmagnetized 
state when the external magnetic field is removed. ( Faraji, Yamini, and Rezaee 2010) 
Superparamagnetism occurs when the thermal fluctuations demagnetize a previ￾ously saturated assembly. Magnetic domain theory illustrate that the critical size of 
the domain is influenced by the factors like the strength of the crystal anisotropy, 
exchange forces, domain wall energy, and the value of magnetic saturation.
9.12 A PPROACHES AND TECHNIQUES IN FABRICATION 
OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
Novel and effective methods have been adopted to synthesize MNPs viz., chemical 
coprecipitation, microemulsion, thermal decomposition, electrochemical, and sol- gel 
precipitation. MNPs are synthesized in different shapes, such as nanorods, nanotubes, 
and hierarchical superstructures by the above methods. However, these methods are 
 196 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
facing serious challenges because of the application of high pressure and temperature, 
utilization of toxic and hazardous chemicals in the fabrication of these metal oxides 
NPs ( Ali et al. 2017). Because of these drawbacks, green fabrication of MNPs serves 
as an Elsevier in wastewater treatment process. In phytofabrication of MNPs, plant 
metabolites are being utilized as reducing and capping agent due to their reductive 
capacities ( Shamaila et al. 2016). Phytofabricated MNPs are reported to be efficient 
in terms of adsorptive removal and resources recovery than conventional nanopar￾ticles ( Cheera et  al. 2016). Phytofabricated MNPs are employed in the removal of 
aqueous pollutants and the recovery of metallic ions due to the presence of organic 
functional groups ( e.g., polyphenols, amino acids, sugars, alkaloids, terpenoids, pro￾teins, carbonyl, carboxyl, and polysaccharides), unique morphology, desired size, 
super paramagnetic behavior and high saturation magnetization valve from waste￾water ( Machado et al. 2015). P lant- based metabolites present in PMNP acts like i on- 
 exchange resins and facilitates the removal of pollutants via electrostatic attractions.
9.13 COPRECIPITATION 
In addition to phytofabrication, coprecipitation is a widely used method for the syn￾thesis of MNPs with desired sizes and magnetic properties ( Sandeep Kumar 2013).

Because of the ease of application, synthetic procedures, and less harmful materi￾als, MNPs are extensively used for wastewater treatment. In coprecipitation process, 
MNPs are prepared from aqueous salt solutions, by the addition of a base under an 
inert atmosphere at room temperatures or at high temperature ( Faraji, Yamini, and 
Rezaee 2010).
9.14 MICROEMULSION
Microemulsion involves isotropic dispersal of oil, water, and surfactant, in combina￾tion with cosurfactant and it is said to be thermodynamically stable. By mixing two 
identical water- in- oil microemulsions consisting of the chosen reactants, the micro￾droplets will continuously collide, coalesce, and break again, and finally a precipitate 
form in the micelles ( Faraji, Yamini, and Rezaee 2010).
The surfactants in water endure rapid coalescence facilitating rapid mixing, 
followed by precipitation and aggregation of nanodroplets in the synthesis of 
MNPs. Compared to other methods, fabrication of MNPs using microemulsion is 
advantageous as they have control over particle size, composition, and crystalline 
nature. Feltin and Pileni ( 1997) synthesized MNPs with average sizes ranging 
from 4 to 12 nm, and standard deviation ranging from 0.2 to 0.3, using micro￾emulsions. Micellar solution of ferrous dodecyl sulfate ( Fe( DS)2) is used for the 
synthesis of MNP and their size is controlled by surfactant concentration and 
temperature.
9.15 POLYOL METHOD
NP synthesis by polyol technique is a most promising approach. It could be effi￾ciently applied in biomedical applications such as magnetic resonance imaging. Fine 
metallic particles can be produced by reducing dissolved metallic salts and directly 
precipitating metals from a solution including a polyol ( Nejati- Koshki et al. 2014). 
Nanocrystalline alloys and bimetallic clusters can be synthesized by polyol method.
In polyol method, the liquid act as a solvent for reduce the metallic precursor 
also act as a complexing agent for the metallic cations. The solution is stirred and 
heated to the boiling point of the polyol. A better control of the mean size of the 
metal particles can be achieved by seeding the reactive medium with foreign par￾ticles ( heterogeneous nucleation) ( Majidi et al. 2014).
9.16 HYDROTHERMAL METHOD
Hydrothermal method also called as the solvothermal method, is one of the most 
successful ways to grow crystals of many different materials ( Faraji, Yamini, 
and Rezaee 2010). This process crystallizes material in a sealed container, from 
aqueous solution at the high temperature range of 130°∆ C to 250°∆ C, and at 
high vapor pressure, generally in the range of 0.3 to 4 MPa ( Wu, He, and Jiang 
2008). However, despite several studies, hydrothermal approaches still fail to 
obtain quality hydrophilic nanocrystals smaller than 10 nm ( Stojanovic et  al. 
2013).
 198 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
9.17 C HEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION ( CVD)
Here in the CVD process, the substrate is exposed to a h ot- wall reactor that contains 
a volatile precursor induces nucleation and facilitates the deposition of the substrate 
in order to obtain the desired thin film. The immense flexibility of CVD process 
facilitates the utilization of chemical materials from the database chemistries. The 
precursors can be solid, liquid, or gas at ambient conditions but are delivered to the 
reactor as a vapor ( from a bubbler or sublimation source, as necessary) ( Majidi et al. 
2014).
9.18 S PRAY PYROLYSIS AND SONOCHEMICAL METHOD
In spray pyrolysis process a solution is sprayed into a series of reactors where in 
the aerosol droplets endure evaporation, with the subsequent condensation of solute 
within the droplet, followed by vaporization and precipitation of substrate. Finally, 
nucleation and development of thin metal film occur. Spray pyrolysis utilizes simple 
equipment and said to be cost effective and very efficient. Produced thin films have 
large surface area of substrate coverage. Due to concerns like poor quality of thin 
film, thermal decomposition and vapor convection spray pyrolysis seems not useful 
( Majidi et al. 2014).
Sonochemical method is one of the simplest methods utilizes sonochemistry for 
obtaining magnetic nanomaterials. High intensity ultrasound is utilized in sonochem￾ical method for the production of novel magnetic nanomaterials. Acoustic cavitation 
is implosive collapse of gas bubbles within the liquid phase that generates localized 
hot spots. Hot spots produced and cavitation process concomitantly triggers oxidant 
radicals production and promotes the formation of final stable phases.
Ultrasonic irradiation facilitates solute diffusion; that subsequently results in 
increased nucleation rate, crystallization process followed by reduction in induction 
time and zone width of the metabolite. The method was found to reduce the chemical 
compound’s toxic environmental impact and reduces the infrastructure requirements 
and incubation time ( Majidi et al. 2014).
Although the above- mentioned nanoparticles are effective for pollutants removal, 
shortcomings like separation of NPs from the effluent and adverse ecotoxicological 
effects by chemical and physical synthesis methods, hinders the application of NPs in 
wastewater treatment ( WWT) process. In this regard, phytofabrication of MNP using 
plant has received major attention in WWT.
9.19 PHYTOFABRICATION AND
CHARACTERIZATION OF PMNPs
There is no single optimal method for the synthesis of MNPs, which vary slightly 
from one another in choice of research findings and application purpose include type 
of MNP, starting material, selection of metal salt, presence or absence of NaOH, 
variable reaction condition, and the method of collecting synthesized NPs ( Ali et al. 
2021). In current era, due to the great variety of applications involving magnetic 
nanoparticles and toxic impacts of the conventional physical and chemical methods, 
 Phytogenic Magnetic Nanoparticles 199
research focus has shifted toward the development of clean and earth- friendly prom￾ising future protocols for MNPs synthesis. Greenly orchestrated magnetic nanopar￾ticles are more effective, fiscally smart, effortlessly scaled up, nontoxic, and easy to 
characterize. In addition, they can be easily separated from the final reaction mix￾ture by applying external magnetic field and reused in consecutive treatment process 
( Priya et al. 2021). Utilization of plants and their phytochemicals are extremely prac￾tical as they are nontoxic. The plant extract with compounds like amino acids, flavo￾noids, saponins, terpenoids, aldehydes, carboxylic acid, proteins, vitamins, enzymes, 
nitrogenous bases, reducing sugars, polyphenols and pigments acts as reducer, stabi￾lizer, redox mediators, and capping agents in PMNPs synthesis ( Gour and Jain 2019). 
Commonly used reducing and capping chemical structure of plant metabolites and 
phytofabrication process is shown in Figure 9.2. As the phytochemicals in the plant 
product reduce metal ions compared to other biological method in shorter time and 
FIGURE 9.2 Schematic representation on the fabrication of phytogenic magnetic nanopar￾ticles ( PMNPs) and the stabilization process.200 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
produce stable NPs, phytogenic MNP synthesis method is superior than other meth￾ods ( Zhang et al. 2020).
In plant product- mediated “ green” synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles, the plant 
metabolites act as reducing and capping agent. Reduction of metal ion happens on the 
addition of sodium acetate ( electrostatic stabilizing agent) to the ion precursor and 
plant extract mixer. Oxidation of plant residues induce the free radicals ( R: – OH– 
 group) formation that interact with the metal ions and forms reduced metal atoms. 
Depending upon the fabrication conditions, metal ions form green nano zero- valent 
metal or metal oxides. In furtherance, organic molecules stabilize the nanoparticles 
to attain desired shape and size. The final black precipitation indicates the fabrication 
of PMNPs. For further application, by applying magnetic field or by simple filtration 
method, the precipitate is to be separated, cleansed with solvent, and oven dried. To 
functionalize the PMNPs for different applications, various ligands were used.
Equations ( 9.1)– ( 9.3) explain the fabrication mechanism of PMNPs ( Ali et al. 2017).
Plant extracts ( polyphenol) + 2FeCl3∙6H O → nZVI/Fe0 2 –plant extract (9.1)
FeSO4∙7H2O + 2FeCl3∙6H2O + 8NH4OH → Fe3O4+ 6NH4Cl +(NH4)2SO4+ 17H2O 
(9.2)
Fe3O4+ plant waste + 17H2O → plant waste–Fe3O4 (9.3)
To ponder the morphology and other conformational subtle elements of PMNPs, 
various methods are most widely utilized ( Faraji, Yamini, and Rezaee 2010; Ali et al. 
2021).
For determining the size and surface morphology,
 1. Dynamic light scattering ( DLS) method and Brunauer Emmet Teller— to 
determine the size, surface area, and particle distribution.
 2. Atomic force microscopy— to illustrate the surface roughness, position of 
the particle, and step height.
3. X - ray diffraction ( XRD)— to define the crystallinity of NPs that includes 
crystal size, crystal perfection, structural parameters, and degree of substi￾tution of metal by other trivalent cations.
 4. Photon correlation spectroscopy, Mossbauer spectroscopy, high- resolution 
TEM, and field emission SEM are used to determine the particle size and 
distribution.
Elemental composition and surface morphology can be determined by wide array of 
methods:
 1. Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) provides data on surface topography 
of the sample and composition.
 2. Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) determines the composition, 
morphology, aggregation state of NPs, electron space shift, lattice spacing, 
and size of NPs.

9.20 FACTORS INFLUENCE THE 
Several factors such as pH, temperature, pressure, light intensity, concentration of

 202 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
center ( protonation– deprotonation) increases as pH increases, and expansion of 
nucleation center enhances the formation of metal nanoparticles by the reduction of 
metal ions. Moreover, high pH favors reduction and stabilizing capacity of the NPs. 
At low pH, especially under acidic condition ( pH <7), the reaction time is longer and 
the NPs synthesized are usually larger ( Ahmad et al. 2020).
9.22 REACTANT CONCENTRATION
The concentration of plant extracts influences the shape, size, and rate of reduction 
in metal nanoparticles formation. Several earlier reports illustrate that the concentra￾tion of plant extract and size of the nanoparticles are inversely proportional.
9.23 INCUBATION TIME
Incubation time is the time interval between the addition of the reactant to the mixture 
and completion of all the steps. Incubation period significantly affects the size morphol￾ogy, stability, and degree of phytofabrication of NPs. The stirring time or incubation 
period enables the proper interaction of metal salt and complex compounds of plant 
for reduction. The reaction time depends on the reaction mixture pH of the solution, 
light intensity, temperature, and enzyme mediated reducing power of plant extract. 
The reaction mixture containing more secondary metabolites reduces the metal salt 
in less time. If the plant contains less secondary metabolites, the phytofabrication of 
NP takes place quickly ( Ahmad et al. 2020). Also, insufficient biomolecules bind with 
metal precursor, which finally results in the formation of instable NPs ( Fazlzadeh et al. 
2016). Increase in the reaction time resulted in an increase in the nanoparticle size by 
aggregation or shrinkage of particles ( Saif, Tahir, and Chen 2016).
9.24 EFFECT OF METAL ION CONCENTRATION
Concentration of precursor influences the synthesis time of iron oxide NPs. Increase 
in concentration of precursor increases the rate of synthesis and vice versa. This phe￾nomenon is attributed to inadequate proportion of biomolecules in the plant extract 
to the precursor for growth and nucleation of nanoparticles in the solution ( Zhu et al. 
2012). By increasing the metal ion concentration, the absorbance peak and particle 
size were increased in metal nanoparticle. ( Dubey, Lahtinen, and Sillanpaa 2010). 
Dehsari et al. ( 2017) reported that the decrease in precursor concentration was found 
to yield iron oxide NPs with decreased size and vice versa.
9.25 REACTION TEMPERATURE
Temperature is one among the factors that influence the size, shape, and reaction 
rate of nanoparticle synthesis. Increasing temperature to an optimum level enhances 
metal nanoparticle synthesis and stability. Iravani and Zolfaghari ( 2013) observed 
that increase in temperature ( 25°C, 50°C, 100°C, and 150°C) leads to increase in 
sharpness of adsorption peak and decrease in size of AgNPs. Earlier studies have 
 Phytogenic Magnetic Nanoparticles 203
reported that magnetic nanoparticles with controlled size, shape, and magnetization 
can be efficiently exploited in various biomedical and biotechnological applications.
9.26 MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLE STABILIZATION
Synthesis method and chemical structure are said to influence the properties 
of MNPs. The smaller size and large surface area of MNPs are very sensitive to 
agglomeration or precipitation. A very simple method to protect its pure metal core 
is known as surface passivation by mild oxidation. The straight forward method is to 
improve the chemical stability of the surface of the MNP that protect the magnetic 
core against the environment. Carbon, silica, organic polymers, surfactants, precious 
metals, and metal oxides ( Figure 9.3) have been successfully employed in encapsu￾lation of MNPs. Stabilization of magnetic nanoparticle is achieved by equilibrium 
between electrostatic or steric repulsion.
9.26.1 organiC Coatings
Surfactants and polymers are either chemically anchored or physically adsorbed as 
single or double layer over the surface of MNPs during synthesis or after synthe￾sis. Surfactants bind covalently to the native hydroxyl groups present on the surface 
of metal oxide. Phosphates and sulfates bind to the surface of magnetic particle. 
Polymers receive more attention than surfactants due to its high repulsive capacity. 
To coat polymers on the surface of MNPs two approaches have been developed. In 
the first approach, macromolecular chains are irreversibly attached by chemisorp￾tions. In another approach, to give brush like hybrid particle, higher number of poly￾mer chains attached directly to the particle surface through polymerization method. 
The drawback behind organic coated MNPs is they are easily leached by acidic solu￾tion and their low intrinsic stability at higher temperature. S urface- modified PMNPs 
FIGURE 9.3 Magnetic nanoparticle organization, arrangement, and applications.204 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
with biocompatible polymers are intensively studied for magnetic fi eld- directed bio￾logical applications.
9.26.2 inorganiC Coating
Titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and aluminum oxide are coated on the surface of 
metal core by controlled oxidation process. The above- mentioned metal oxide sur￾faces are readily modified with phosphorylated molecules. Due to its specific surface 
derivative property, gold is widely used to coat MNPs. Surface of gold is well known 
for self- assembling of thiolated molecules, which results in monolayer formation.
The most common method to deposit precious metal on MNPs surface is redox 
transmetalation, reactions in microemulsion, and sonolysis ( produces air- stable 
magnetic iron NPs). Magnetic nanoparticle coated with noble metal shells results in 
enhanced chemical stability and high electrical conductivity.
Silica coated magnetic microspheres show stable negative charge ranging from 
pH 6 to 7. The magnetic core covered by silica has unique magnetic responsivity, low 
cytotoxicity, and easy control of interparticle interactions. These magnetic proper￾ties can be fine- tuned by varying chemical composition and the shell’s thickness. 
Two approaches called stober process and microemulsion synthesis were employed 
to generate silica coating. Silica was formed through in situ hydrolysis and condensa￾tion of a sol- gel precursor in stober process. In microemulsion synthesis, micelles or 
inverted micelles control the silica coating on the core– shell surface.
 Carbon- encapsulated MNPs have received much attention for many biological 
applications. In addition, carbon is stable both chemically and thermally, further, 
cheap and biocompatible. Owing to the above advantages various methods, chemical 
vapor depositions, combustion, pulse laser decomposition, arc discharge techniques, 
and pyrolysis of metal complexes were developed actively.
9.26.3 organiC and inorganiC CoMbinations
In order to increase the chemical stability of magnetic nanoparticles, organic shell 
components are cross- linked with polymeric chains, which also protect the magnetic 
core from chemical and physical decomposition.
9.27 STRATEGIES TO FUNCTIONALIZATION
Ideal MNPs should be chemically stable and possess liquid medium dispersion abil￾ity. Surface functional group influences the particle interactions with environment. 
Therefore, in post synthetic modification of MNPs, a suitable functional group is 
to be added, which render MNPs to be chemically stable. The electrostatic c himio- 
 adsorption and covalent conjugation are the two strategies used for surface func￾tionalization includes either ligand addition or surface ligand exchange. In ligand 
addition to the original ligands, incoming ligands were added and form double- layer- 
 like structure. In ligand exchange, a new bifunctional ligand replaces the original 
ligand. In pollutant extraction and removal, s urface- modified MNPs have been 
proven to be efficient.Phytogenic Magnetic Nanoparticles 205
9.28 APPLICATION OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLE
Magnetic nanoparticle with different size and shape is tailored to explore their mag￾netic behavior and possibility of application in new areas. Due to their extraordinary 
magnetic behavior, magnetic nanomaterials in imaging, magnetic hyperthermia, bio￾sensors, pollutant remediation, and other applications are possible.
In magnetic hyperthermia, MNP converts magnetic energy to heat, which is used to 
detect, capture, and eradicate the cancerous cell in free form or at the targeted region.
In magnetic separation, specific target analytes like cells, proteins, DNA, and patho￾genic substances are selectively removed ( Zhang et al. 2013). Owing to the characters 
like biocompatibility, durability, safety, and magnetic signaling, the M NPs- based 
biosensors have shown remarkable applications in clinical diagnosis, food industry, 
and environment monitoring. Recently, MNPs- based strategies have developed to kill 
microbes through disrupting plasma membrane, releasing toxic metals and generation 
of reactive oxygen species ( ROS), e.g., Fe3O4 magnetic microbots ( Dong et al. 2021).
9.29 ROLE OF PMNPS IN THE REMOVAL OF POLLUTANTS
Due to ever increasing population, severe droughts, and strict water quality stan￾dards, there is an increasing demand for clean water. In recent years, application of 
nanotechnologies in water treatment process has become popular. Requirements of 
the future generation on freshwater demand can be met by the application of MNPs 
in wastewater treatment. Phytofabricated magnetic nanoparticles possess unique 
physical, chemical, and biological properties, thereby able to sense water pollution 
and offer quantum scale wastewater treatment and prevention at low yield cost. The 
high surface area to volume ratio of MNPs enhances the reactivation rate with con￾taminants and provides everlasting wastewater treatment strategies. Use of PMNP 
membrane enables water reuse and desalination that provides water quality and 
quantity in the long run.
PMNPS has the potential to provide both water quality and quantity in the long 
run through the use of membranes enabling water reuse and desalination. The unique 
properties of MNPs viz., high absorption potential, strong interaction, and efficient 
reaction capabilities with pollutants on the aqueous suspensions display quantum 
size effects ( Amin, Alazba, and Manzoor 2014).
A wide verity of metallic ions in pollutant water is efficiently adsorbed by magnetic 
nanomaterials. Resin- based magnetic chelating materials and magnetic hydrogels are also 
used in the removal of Cu( II), Co( II), and Ni( II) ions. Acrylate- based polymer compos￾ites exhibit a selective and orderly manner ( Cu>Cr>Zn>Ni) in the removal of heavy met￾als. Magnetic zeolite composites are used in the removal of heavy metal contaminants.
Dyes in the wastewater had a lethal impact on human health. In addition to 
heavy metals, magnetic nanoparticles are efficient adsorbents in the removal of dyes 
released from industries. Therefore, magnetic nanoparticles are fabricated for the 
efficient adsorption of dyes released from industries and chemicals from pharma￾ceutical industries. Earlier literature illustrate that magnetic nanoparticle removes 
nearly 95% of pharmaceutical wastes. Gallic acid coated magnetic nanoparticles 
( GA- MNP) are used as a photocatalyst in the degradation of meloxicam, a nonsteroi￾dal a nti- inflammatory drug ( Sharma et al. 2018).206 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
9.30 DISINFECTION
In addition to removal of pollutants, disinfection process is also facilitated by mag￾netic nanomaterials. Magnetic nanomaterials possess reasonably good removal effi￾ciencies of biological contaminants. The contaminants are categorized into three 
types, namely, natural organic matter ( NOM), biological toxins, and microorgan￾isms. Disinfection of waste sources using chlorine was already reported to be car￾cinogenic and lead to the formation of harmful b y- products. UV radiation mediated 
disinfection requires longer exposure time. Utilization of magnetic nanoparticles in 
disinfection technologies is in limelight due to their potential in the elimination of 
pathogens, stability, large- scale adoption, low toxicity, and microbial inactivation in 
water ( Amin, Alazba, and Manzoor 2014).
In PMNPs, plant metabolites act as the reducing and capping agent facilitate 
the removal of toxic heavy metals. T he – OH groups in the plant extract facilitate 
the removal of metal ions by electrostatic attraction process. Compared to other 
NPs, PMNPs are reported to be superior in the removal of toxic dyes like methy￾lene blue, methyl orange, and its degradation. Anionic and cationic dyes are 
removed by adsorption behavior of PMNPs. In addition to dyes, organic pollut￾ants are also efficiently removed from wastewater. Adsorptive removal of nitrate 
from wastewater was facilitated due to chemisorptions mechanism. Various 
studies have been carried out on the utilization of PMNPS in the removal of 
organic pollutants; however, more research efforts are required to investigate 
PMNPs potential in the removal of persistent or refractory organic pollutants 
( Ali et al. 2017).
9.31 CONCLUSION
To conclude in the backdrop of conventional and advanced wastewater treatment 
technique, all the techniques to be adopted should be scrutinized thoroughly on the 
cost, feasibility, output, pollution removal index, and e co- friendly nature. Magnetic 
nanoparticles ( MNPs) mediated environmental remediation offers great promise and 
said to be fast and effective. Like other new and remediation technologies, there are 
concerns regarding safety and effectiveness on the utilization of metal nanoparticles. 
For example, there is no widely accepted ecotoxicological standard to compare par￾ticle toxicity. Furthermore, any alterations made to the nanoparticles, either a new 
coating or addition of catalyst in order to enhance the remediation is said to alter the 
particle behavior. Therefore, to conclude, the above characteristics restrict the usage 
of phytofabricated magnetic metal nanoparticles in large scale in WWT process. In 
situ pilot- scale tests have to be carried out to highlight the positive outcomes on the 
usage of magnetic metal nanoparticles in WWT.

10.1 FUNCTIONAL NANOMATERIALS AND THEIR IMPORTANCE
People have been interested in finding a suitable advanced nanomaterial for upcom￾ing energy storage and conservation applications for the past two decades. In this 
regard, the creation of nanomaterials or nanostructures has been recognized as cru￾cial for future generations’ efforts [1,2]. Functional nanomaterials have the potential 
to be used in numerous technical applications, such as solar cells, batteries, catalysis, 
drug delivery, and wastewater treatment, due to their exceptional physical, chemical, 
electrical, and optical capabilities. Therefore, research into novel, highly functional 
nanomaterials is crucial for applications involving renewable energy in the future [3].
Advanced nanotechnology materials with potential features at the nanoscale are 
called functional nanomaterials. It can also be described as “ a chemical that is well 
controlled and ordered by the molecular body that is available at the nanometer 
level size” [2,3]. It has undergone postprocessing, both chemically and physically, to 
acquire certain attributes that the original material lacked, such as absorbance, fluo￾rescence, strength, ductility, solubility, and wettability. They can be employed exten￾sively in the medical field to penetrate biological systems for purposes such as drug 
administration and cancer treatment because of their extreme nano size [4]. These 
substances are highly reactive in catalytic and adsorption applications, which aid in 
separating molecules with greater sensitivity for improved catalytic effectiveness. So, 
by tuning their structural and chemical properties, they can be transformed into new 
multifunctional nanomaterials which are essential for energy device applications.
Functional nanomaterials and devices hold great promise for use in various indus￾tries, including catalysis, waveguide, chemical and biosensors, solar cells, nanoscale 
electronics, light- emitting nanodevices, laser technology, and waveguide. The scientific 
community has identified a large number of functional materials that are frequently 
employed to create incredibly innovative and cutting- edge technologies for a variety of 
uses [5,6]. Particularly praiseworthy is the use of functional nanomaterials in the fields 
of medicine, optoelectronics, and catalysis. Functional nanomaterials have a crucial 
role in all cutting- e dge scientific and technological sectors, as illustrated in Figure 10.1.
At the moment, nanoparticles with very tiny sizes are highly helpful in the medi￾cal disciplines for a variety of applications. Additionally, these nanomaterials have 
expanded their range of uses to include the development of molecular machinery and 
pharmaceuticals. Nanomaterials are widely used in the semiconductor and electrical 
industries in addition to the medical sector. The better electrical and optical proper￾ties of nanoparticles and quantum dots, all of which are smaller than 10 nm, make 
them more appropriate for use in the creation of h igh- resolution electronic devices Magnetic Nanomaterials for Solar Energy Conversion Applications 213
• Mainly, it helps in reducing the manufacturing cost and facilitates to get 
high efficiency in new- generation solar cells [7].
• It widely imparts to modify the traditional and conventional wafer solar cells 
to semiconductor solar cells with low- cost fabrication and installation [8].
• Solar cells can be fabricated even at room temperature instead of making at 
high vacuum deposition processes.
• High conversion efficiency can be achieved by using quantum dots and 
nanocomposites to gather more sunlight over a wide spectrum [9].
• Plasmonic nanomaterials also offer operative ways to diminish the thick￾ness of absorber coatings [10].
• Spectral tuning in quantum- confined materials, sensitizing dyes, and poly￾mers provides a superior effect on optical band gap, which helps to produce 
photon-generated charge carriers [11].

[6]. In addition to electrical devices, nanomaterials are frequently utilized in the 
creation of extremely sensitive sensors, RFID sensors, l ight- emitting diodes ( LEDs), 
and touch displays in contemporary smartphones. Advanced functional nanoma￾terials technology has effectively brought about this transition from l arge- scale to 
nanoscale devices.
10.2 FUNCTIONAL NANOMATERIALS IN SOLAR CELLS
Due to their exceptional optical and electrical capabilities, these functional nanoma￾terials are increasingly important in solar cells and other renewable energy technol￾ogy. The significant functional nanomaterials currently employed in solar cells are 
depicted in Figure 10.2. Additionally, the following are some advantages of these 
useful nanomaterials in the field of solar cells:214 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
 
FIGURE 10.2 Various functional nanomaterials used in solar cells. Reprinted from Reference 
11 with permission.
Considering the energy demand of the future world, these functional nanomaterials 
may provide new nanotechnological mechanisms and devices to get more efficient 
utilization of sunlight energy. Thus, these functional semiconducting nanomaterials 
have the potential to produce more and more new next- generation nanodevices for a 
variety of applications in the near future.
10.3 SOLAR CELLS
The solar cell is a device that converts sunlight into electricity. Solar energy is only 
the answer to future energy crisis problems. This can be understood from the quote 
“t he one and only solution for the future energy crisis daily appears at east in the 
morning and disappears at west in evening.” Solar energy is abundant in the world. 
The simplest way to convert solar energy into useful electricity is achieved by the use Magnetic Nanomaterials for Solar Energy Conversion Applications 215
FIGURE 10.3 Types of solar cells and their materials.
of photovoltaic solar cell technology [12,13]. It is a clean, renewable energy technol￾ogy with carbon- free and environmentally clean. Among the other renewable energy 
technologies, solar cell technology has the ability to resolve the future terawatt 
energy demand of the world. Solar cells can be classified into four main categories 
based on the materials which are used for the absorption of sunlight and their typi￾cal device architecture [14]. Types of solar cells and the typical materials used were 
mentioned in Figure 10.3.
10.3.1 s iliCon solar Cells
Solar cells are mainly made of silicon ( Si) materials that are m ono- a nd p oly-t ypes of 
silicon wafers, which are made from large- scale Si single crystals. The silicon solar 
cells are fabricated by producing single crystals of silicon into silicon wafers, which 
act light harvesting part of the solar cell. However, these Si solar cells are classi￾fied into three categories as wafer- based crystalline silicon, gallium arsenide (G aAs), 
and m ulti-j unction solar cells. Si solar cell technology is a well- established one that 
holds a maximum of 27.6% power conversion efficiency ( PCE) in multi- junction 216 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
FIGURE 10.4 Schematic structures of ( a) Si, ( b) CIGS, ( c) DSSC, and ( d) perovskite solar 
cells. Reprinted from References 42 with permission.
Si solar cells [15]. A typical schematic structure of Si solar cells is represented in 
 Figure 10.4( a). It consists of an aluminum backing for energy transfer, a p- type Si and 
an n- type Si for electron production and recombination, and an antireflective coat￾ing ( preferably SiNx or TiO2), which prevents air moisture and is followed by metal 
contacts. However, due to its indirect band gap value of Si materials ( 1.1 eV) at room 
temperature leads to fabricating a h igh-t hickness absorber layer in the order of mil￾limeter size [16]. Si solar cells have a very thick absorber, high manufacturing costs, 
expensive precursors, a high vacuum manufacturing method, and the hard and brittle 
character of Si materials, which has encouraged researchers to develop a substitute 
material for it.
10.3.2 thin filM solar Cells
The second- generation solar cells are mainly divided into two categories such as cop￾per indium gallium sulfide/s elenide (C IGSSe) and cadmium telluride ( CdTe) solar 
cells, where these two p- type semiconductor materials are used as an absorber mate￾rial [17]. From F igure  10.4(b ), a simple difference between the Si solar cells and 
CIGS solar cells is that the semiconductor material used in the solar cell has a direct 
optical band gap instead of an indirect band gap Si and therefore it relies on p– n junc￾tion design. CdTe, Cu2InGa(SSe)4, and CuIn( SSe)2 are the most common absorber 
materials, which were used in the thin film solar cells [18]. Here, A l- ZnO and MgF2
are two common anti-r eflection coating materials used in thin film solar cells. Ni/A l 
contacts were added to the structure for electrical energy flow. These solar cells have 
reached a high PCE of 23.6%, which is very close to crystalline Si solar cells. It also 
has some significant drawbacks like h igh-c ost and l ess-a bundant precursor mate￾rials, and most important is the presence of environmentally toxic materials [19]. Magnetic Nanomaterials for Solar Energy Conversion Applications 217
Recently, researchers have drawn their interest to identifying and synthesizing new 
functional nanomaterials to replace these toxic and h igh- cost materials deprived of 
negotiating on the power conversion efficiency.
10.3.3 third- generation solar Cells
 Dye- sensitized solar cells ( DSSCs) and polymer and organic solar cells are types of 
 third- generation solar cells, which have several advantages such as flexibility, l ow- 
 cost processability, and ease of fabrication at room temperature. Among those advan￾tages, the flexibility gives an additional feature to the polymer solar cells, which 
allows the solar cells to be incorporated into all kinds of applications, most notably 
where flexibility is needed. Compared with previously discussed, these solar cells 
can be made by simple solution processing method at room temperature environ￾ment [20,21]. This feature allows for scaling up these solar cells in a large manner 
and thus reducing the production cost. DSSCs are not considered as organic solar 
cells because they use organometallic dyes and inorganic semiconducting material as 
photoanode. A typical schematic of DSSC is shown in Figure 10.3( c). The only disad￾vantage of these materials is their l ong- term stability [22]. Researchers are working 
to solve this stability problem and make this material a potential one.
10.3.4 fourth- generation solar Cells
Emerging solar cells comprise a more sophisticated form of solar cell that frequently 
employ massive cost- conducting polymers behaving both n- type semiconductors with 
 organic- inorganic hybrid materials working for p- type semiconductors. The standard 
structure of a perovskite solar cell is shown in Figure 10.4( d). Perovskites including 
those composed of methylammonium lead halide ( CH3NH3PbX3) were commonly 
implemented active light harvesters, whereas various polymeric polymers are being 
used as materials that transport holes within perovskite solar cells. [23]. Due to their 
high efficiency attained in a relatively short amount of time as well as their superior 
material characteristics, which enable to absorb a greater number of light photons 
from sunlight, these solar cells have recently received a great deal of attention from 
researchers. The main disadvantages of these materials, however, were lead toxicity, 
reproducibility, and stability [24,25]. These limitations are now being overcome, and 
these materials may conceivably be used for solar cell applications in the future.
10.4 MAGNETIC NANOMATERIALS
Iron, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, gadolinium, and other magnetic elements 
and their chemical compounds make up magnetic nanoparticles, which are nanomateri￾als [26]. Due to their nanoscale size, magnetic nanoparticles are superparamagnetic and 
have significant promise in a wide range of applications, whether they are uncoated or 
coated with functional groups chosen for particular applications. The most researched 
magnetic nanoparticles, in particular ferrite nanoparticles, can be significantly boosted 
by grouping many individual superparamagnetic nanoparticles into clusters to form 
magnetic beads [27]. An electromagnet or permanent magnet can generate an external 
 218 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
magnetic field that can transport magnetic nanoparticles to a specific location after 
already being selectively linked to a functional molecule [28]. A surface layer may be 
necessary to stop aggregation and reduce the contact of the particles with the system 
environment. To boost their stability in solution, spinel ferrites are frequently s urface- 
 modified with surfactants, silica, silicones, or phosphoric acid derivatives.
Due to their potential use in sophisticated optoelectronic devices and nano￾medicine, functional magnetic nanomaterials, whose properties are fundamentally 
different from those of their bulk counterparts, have garnered interest on a global 
scale. Materials that have at least one t hree- dimensional dimension that is either 
in the nanometer size range ( 1– 100 nm) or is made up entirely of them are referred 
to as nanomaterials. Solar energy conversion equipment primarily uses inorganic 
magnetic nanoparticles like Fe3O4. Magnetite ( Fe3O4), maghemite (-Fe2O3), and 
hematite (-Fe2O3) are the three types of iron oxides that occur most frequently in 
nature [28,29]. Currently, the primary techniques used to prepare magnetic nanopar￾ticles include coprecipitation, high- temperature decomposition, microemulsion, and 
reverse micelle. Magnetic nanoparticles are easily modified, have a large specific 
surface area, and require little preparation. However, when solely Fe3O4 and -Fe2O3
are utilized as adsorbents, particles have a tendency to clump together, which reduces 
adsorption selectivity and the enrichment effect. We must conduct more studies in 
the future to develop a more straightforward and workable preparation method that 
will swiftly produce magnetic nanoparticles with a narrower particle size dispersion, 
high purity, and good magnetic fineness [29]. In the meantime, new modification 
techniques must be developed to cover the magnetic particles, increase chemical 
stability, stop oxidation, and give them a unique function.
10.5 PROPERTIES OF MAGNETIC NANOMATERIALS
Iron nanoparticles react violently with oxidizing substances, especially air. Each 
nanoparticle is covered with a thin coating to prevent it from oxidizing completely 
and permanently. For this purpose, silica and gold were being used for coatings; how￾ever, these diminish the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles. By creating appro￾priate techniques, significant advancements have been made in the two major factors 
that influence the significance of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles, namely, control 
over the size and form. Additionally, a magnesium coating is being used, which has 
little effect on the magnetic properties of the iron particles [27]. Iron nanoparticles 
are mixed with smaller- than- microscopic magnesium particles in the substance that 
is created, making it complex. Iron carbide coating is the most practical way for 
creating virtually totally magnetic iron particles that are shielded from oxidation; 
nevertheless, the resulting particles are larger ( 20– 100 nm), polydisperse, and fer￾romagnetic, therefore, they are not so ideal [28]. Nevertheless, this is a significant 
advancement. Due to their magnetic characteristics and numerous uses, iron oxide 
nanoparticles are extremely important. Colloidal iron and iron oxide nanoparticles 
have significant size- dependent structural and optical features that are related to 
electrical structure and quantum size effects [29]. Their size and crystal structure 
might also vary depending on the synthesis process used.Magnetic Nanomaterials for Solar Energy Conversion Applications 219
10.6 M AGNETIC NANOMATERIALS FOR 
SOLAR ENERGY CONVERSION
10.6.1 fe3o4 in bulk heterojunCtion ( bhj) solar Cells
Because of their advantages in regard to cost, flexibility, and light weight, polymer 
solar cells ( PSCs) featuring bulk heterojunction ( BHJ) have garnered a lot of inter￾est. The photoactive layer within BHJ structure, which has been described as the 
most effective architecture of PSCs so far with, has been constituted of a conju￾gated polymer benefactor, including such poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), 
and a soluble fullerene acceptor, commonly [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl 
ester ( PCBM) [30,31]. While there has been notable development research on novel 
donor and acceptor materials and additives used in new types of BHJ- PSCs, attain￾ing the PCE has remained an obstacle. The emphasis of most recent research on 
P3HT:PCBM BHJ- PSCs has focused on postthermal processing of photoactive lay￾ers or strengthening microphase separation structure by selecting appropriate sol￾vents for the treatment of the photoactive layers [32].
Importantly, it has been demonstrated that the solvent that dissolves the 
P3HT:PCBM mix has a massive effect on PCE for P3HT:PCBM BHJ- PSCs. This 
is mostly because charge carrier mobility is reliant just on solvents used to process 
the photoactive layers and is sensitive to the nanoscale morphology of the thin film 
made up of the paired photoactive materials [33]. The open circuit voltage ( Voc), 
fill factor ( FF), and s hort- circuit current ( Jsc) of PCE are now all strongly linked 
with the difference between both the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO 
level of the acceptor. The FF is formed by the charge carriers that emerge at the 
electrodes when the constructed field is reduced near the open circuit voltage. 
The Jsc density and the charge carrier mobility inside the photoactive material are 
determined by the amplification of the photo- generated charge carrier. It is gener￾ally known that in organic compounds like P3HT, the principal charge carriers 
generated by light are s o- called excitons, which can exist in singlet states or triplet 
states with varying lifetimes. Dissociated excitons or e lectron- hole pairs bound 
via Coulomb were the only charge carriers that could contribute to the photocur￾rent [34]. For the efficiency of this procedure, the fact that the singlet lifespan in 
P3HT is approximately 300 ps and that the succeeding singlet exciton diffusion 
length is reported to be in the range of 3– 6 nm, which is a significant bottleneck. 
The triplet exciton diffusion length is in the region of 100 nm, in contrast, with 
both the P3HT triplet lifespan being within the range of 10 ms. This enhances the 
photovoltaic process in organic solar cells by enabling the triplet exciton’s diffu￾sion process toward d onor- acceptor junctions smoother [35]. The increased triplet 
concentration results in a higher probability of interfacial exciton dissociation 
and charge separation. Although triplet excitons have a longer lifespan and, as a 
result, longer diffusion than singlet excitons, they have been utilized as a remedy 
for BHJ cells [36].
Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles are doped into P3HT: PCBM BHJ PSC by Zhang 
et al. They discover that PCE is being enhanced [33]. The factor ( Voc, Jsc, FF) most 
responsible for the improved PCE is identified, and the impact of Fe3O4 magnetic 220 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

with and without OA-Fe3O4 PSCs. Reprinted from Reference 33 with permission.
nanoparticles is considered. When exposed to simulated AM 1.5 radiation, PCE of 
the device was measured in an air atmosphere ( Figure 10.5).
The current– voltage ( J– V) curves were obtained at various nanoparticle doping 
ratios. The P3HT:PCBM gadget in its purest form displays a PCE of 2.62% utilizing 
chloroform as the solvent. This is mostly due to the fact that fabrication processes are 
carried out in an air atmosphere in vacuum level ( 10−5 torr) is insufficient for the top 
Al electrode’s deposition. Each P CE- determining parameter, including Jsc, Voc, and 
FF, is compared in order to identify the factor responsible for the PCE’s improvement 
with the doping of O A- Fe3O4 nanoparticles from 0.5% to 2%. In contrast to the pure 
device, the Voc of OA-Fe3O4 devices remains constant 0.6 0-0 .61 V [33]. Nevertheless, 
the J 2 sc 3 4
They also found that the PCE of the device rose by 18% when Fe3O4 was subse￾quently inserted. This improvement is mostly owing to a 14% rise in Jsc, which is 
attributable to the magnetic field influence of the superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanopar￾ticles, which elevates the population of triplet excitons [33,34]. This investigation 
confirmed that the observed enhancement of PCE were caused solely either by mag￾netic property of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. It is also determined if Fe3O4 nanoparticles 
have an effect on the improvement of PCE of the device by contrasting various dop￾ing techniques. Additionally, they discovered that even in the air atmosphere, the 
magnetic field effect depends on by Fe3O4 nanoparticles is efficiently achieved, mak￾ing efficiency improvement relatively simple [36,37]. Because applying an external 
magnetic field for l arge-a rea PSCs, which is often required for commercial applica￾tions, is unrealistic, our discovery provides a simple and practical method to achieve 
the magnetic field effect produced by magnetic nanoparticles in PSCs.
of OA-Fe O devices increase significantly from 8.41 to 9.55 mA/ cm .
10.6.2 r ole of MagnetiC nanopartiCles in dssC
Recently, numerous initiatives have been made to increase the DSSCs effectiveness 
by customizing its various components. The photoanode’s morphological, structural, 
and chemical alterations have received the most attention among them. Regardless of 
the existence of numerous metal oxide semiconductors (M OS), titanium oxide (T iO2) Magnetic Nanomaterials for Solar Energy Conversion Applications 221
has been widely used as a photoanode material in DSSCs due to the rapid injection 
rate of electrons from excited dye into the TiO2 conduction band ( CB). The PCE of 
a device is decreased by TiO2’s poor electron mobility, which leads in exception￾ally high recombination reaction rates [38]. In DSSC and perovskites cells, the opto￾electronic properties of various other oxides have also been thoroughly investigated 
[37–39].
The investigation from several potential materials to make cheap counter elec￾trodes is the other component in the efficient production of DSSC. Because CE is 
typically far more expensive than a photoanode due to its fabrication from precious 
metals like platinum ( Pt), it incurs a higher capital cost [39]. An ideal CE should 
have the following characteristics: relatively high adhesion, moderate cost, increased 
catalytic activity, substantial reflectivity, large surface area, porosity, stability, and 
energy level that is properly matched with electrolyte potential. 2D graphene has 
lately received a lot of attention because of its numerous beneficial characteristics. 
Reduced graphene oxide or rGO has excellent dispersibility and solution process￾ability. Since magnetite ( Fe3O4) nanoparticles have a vast surface area and good dis￾persion, they have been widely used in many fields. Compared to other iron oxides, 
Fe3O4 nanoparticles display higher optoelectronic properties and improved optical 
absorption in solar cells. To show an enhancement in PCE, Zhou et al. coated Fe3O4
NPs on the shallow of rGO [40]. Therefore, graphene oxide and metal oxides can 
be used together as CE in DSSC to replace limited Pt and provide better optoelec￾tronic properties. Akbhar Ali Qureshi et  al. made the two functioning electrodes 
of a DSSC to investigate the effects of change on photovoltaic properties [38]. A 
simple solvothermal method was used to create hybrid Fe3O4@rGO CE and SnO2- 
TiO2
F igure 10.6 represents the Fe3O4@rGO DSSCs cyclic voltammetry (C V) curves 
at a scan rate of 100 mV. (a ) Based on the two pairs of oxidation/r eduction peaks on 
the CV voltammogram, the hybrid Fe3O4@rGO nanocomposite has a respectable 
electrochemical capacity for iodide/t ri-i odide redox processes. A reasonable catalytic 
activity for tri-i odide reduction too is revealed either by hybrid Fe3O4@rGO nano￾composite’s narrow Epp value. Based on the CV results, a counter electrode composed 
of a Fe3O4@rGO nanocomposite is used, which significantly increased the surface 
area of the FTO substrate, optimizing the electrochemical attributes of the DSSC [38].
nanocomposite-based photoanodes.
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS) spectra are shown in 
 Figure 10.6( c) for various CEs. To compare the Fe3O4@rGO CE’s charge transfer 
properties to those of traditional ( Pt) CE in the DSSC, the high- frequency semicircu￾lar area in the two semicircles can be studied to assess charge transfer resistance ( Rct) 
in order to understand the enhancement in catalytic performance due to the large 
number of active sites present. The hybrid counter electrode has multiple active sites 
for tri- iodide reduction for enhanced catalytic performance. It is understood from 
this study that Rct of the device is greater than Pt and it is depicted in F igure 10.6( d). 
The slant was used to measure the exchange current density ( Jsc) [38]. The findings 
show that hybrid CE, when compared to platinum, has a good diffusion velocity for 
the reduction of tri- iodide, which is due to the wrapping of Fe3O4@rGO nanosheets.
From F igure 10.7(a ), it is understood that PCE of 3.28% with standard Pt CE was 
shown by the dye- sensitized solar cells which has SnO2-TiO2 nanocomposite-based222 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
FIGURE 10.6 (a)–(d) Electrochemical analysis of Fe3O4@rGO CE based DSSC. Reprinted

photoanode. In order to improve the photovoltaic characteristics of DSSC, multi￾ple benefits, particularly band gap reduction and enhanced light scattering effects, 
played a key role. By giving tri- iodide additional oxidation sites, Fe3O4 nanoparticles 
with superior optoelectronic properties and rGO with higher electronic conductivity 
significantly improved DSSC performance [37,38]. It is conceivable that the making 
of SnO2-TiO2 nanostructure through Fe3O4@r GO- b ased CE in DSSC is what pro￾duced the noteworthy upsurge in the VOC rate. Since TiO2 has an isoelectric level that 
is significantly greater than that of SnO2, it pushes and increases Voc. As a result, the 
DSSCs hybrid Fe3O4@rGO CE and SnO2-TiO2 photoanode displayed a decent PCE 
that was relatively equivalent to Pt. As a result, conventional pricey Pt CE can be 
replaced with low-cost hybrids.
The best spectrum response when compared to Pt is depicted in Figure 10.7( b) 
[38]. The DSSCs exhibit dominance values of Jsc because of the interaction between 
the altered functional electrodes, which increased charge transfer and enabled for 
maximal dye loading [39,40]. Additionally, they agreed that P t-f ree DSSCs may well 
be produced that used a hybrid Fe3O4@rGO CE and a photoanode by integrating 
those elements in a cooperative fashion.
10.6.3 fe2o3 nanopartiCles in perovskite solar Cells
The perovskite solar cells (P erSCs) considered as one of the significant solar cell 
technology in recent year. The PCE of PerSCs solar cell improved from 3.8% to more Magnetic Nanomaterials for Solar Energy Conversion Applications 223
FIGURE  10.7 (a ) PCE performance of DSSCs on various CE including Fe3O4 in rGO. 
Reprinted from Reference 38 with permission.
than 25% from around 10 years [41,42]. Perovskite solar cells have a high PCE, but 
their stability is still insufficient for practical applications. The primary cause is water 
and oxygen in the air corroding solar cells, which can be prevented by adequately 
packing the solar cells or by preparing the solar cells’ outer surfaces to repel water 
[43]. To achieve stable device functioning in this scenario, we can substitute less ther￾mally stable perovskite materials with better thermally stable perovskite materials or 
2D perovskite materials [44]. Because the layer deteriorates due to the UV portion of 
sunlight reacting with ETLs like TiO2, research into the use of an ultraviolet protec￾tive coating to increase stability is significantly required.
Visible light is absorbed by iron oxide ( Fe2O3), an n - type semiconductor with an 
appropriate energy band location, excellent chemical stability, and a reasonable cost 
[43]. In perovskite solar cells, Fe2O3 has been recurrently labored as stable layer. 
Wang et  al. created a thin Fe2O3 coating that remained stable over the course of 
30 days when exposed to outside air. Fe2O3-b ased devices perform well in terms of 
stability, although their PCE is still modest [44]. In order to efficiently increase con￾ductivity in perovskite solar cells, Guo et al. used a Ni-F e2O3 thin film as charge 
transport layers. Compared to devices without Fe2O3 doped devices, the PCE of 
devices influences 14.2%, an increase of 150% [45]. H igh- q uality Fe2O3 thin films 
can create stable perovskite solar cells with high PCE, although doing so is challeng￾ing due to Fe2O3’s poor electrical conductivity and crystallinity.
 Figure 10.8 displays the schematics of several Fe2O3 films produced employing 
nanoparticles and FeCl3 solution ( a). Due to the exceptional hydrophilicity of water- 
 dispersed nanoparticles, the films may self-a ssemble on the ITO surface, and h igh￾q uality iron oxide films may be produced as a result of the tiny crystal structure 
change that occurs during the annealing process. The spin-c oated FeCl3 film for 
films made with FeCl3 solution has an excellent density, but during the postannealing 
process, the iron oxide crystallization process will result in the production of numer￾ous holes in the initially dense film [42]. Figure 10.8 demonstrates the architecture 
for the charge transport mechanism of several Fe2O3 layers (b ). Fe3O4 nanoparticles 
were employed to form a thick Fe2O3 layer that delivers improved carrier separation. 224 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
FIGURE 10.8 ( a) Schematic of Fe2O3 films and ( b) Schematic of the charge transport model 
of Fe2O3 devices. Reprinted from Reference 42 with permission.
In contrary, the amount of holes in FeCl3-produced Fe2O3 layers can enable the 
perovskite layer to be in direct contact with the ITO layer, making it simple for car￾riers to recombine during the transmission process.
As shown in F igure 10.9( a), the sample made with FeCl3 has the lowest PV param￾eters. In this research, they have identified that the Fe2O3 layer is not fulfill the role 
of charge transport layers, which is notified from lowering the Voc. Different Voc may 
also result from probable differences in the multidimensional Fermi levels of numer￾ous charge layers [4 2– 45]. They stated that the preferable size of the nanoparticles 
was between 10 and 15 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS) Nyquist 
plots of a number of ETLs are given in Figure 10.9( b), where the tested results are rep￾resented by symbol curves and the fitted results are presented with solid line curves 
[42,45]. They assume that now the semicircle at high frequency depicts the gets trans￾ferred (Rct) at the transport layer/p erovskite interface while the transmission line at 
low frequency represents its recombination impedance ( Rrec
F igure 10.9(c ) demonstrates the J– V c urves, which are measurements of the leak￾age performance of several Fe2O3 layers in the dark model (c ). Since the higher voltage 
corresponds to the nanoparticle samples’ lowest point on the leaked graph, this indi￾cates that they have higher leakage properties than the FeCl3 sample. Additionally,

the sample containing high- p otential 10 nm nanoparticles exhibits a lower leakage 
value than the others, suggesting improved anti- leakage capabilities. Figure 10.9( d) 
illustrates the band location of the Fe2O3 layer [46,47]. The test material was an n- 
 type semiconductor since the slope of the curve has an undesirable charge. The prob￾able worth of the produced FeCl3 model is 0.76 V. A higher band position for both 
the nanoparticle sample than the FeCl3 sample is demonstrated by the lower value, 
which is in accordance with the Voc tendency as determined by the J– V me asurement. 
The planar Fe2O3- based thin film solar cells demonstrated good stability at more 
than 95% efficiency after irradiation. They also advocated utilizing w ater-d ispersed 
Fe3O4 nanoparticles. [48]. These cells had a 14.3% efficiency achieved by ITO/ Fe2O3/
(FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au combination. The superior perfor￾mance of the solar cells is attributed to the dense Fe2O3 layer’s exceptional ultravio￾let endurance and effective vacuum distillation of interface flaws [42]. This method 
has a lot of potential for producing perovskite solar cells that are affordable, UV 
stable, and effective.
10.7 C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE OUTLOOK
Contrary to conventional semiconductor solar cells, ferroelectric solar cells have a 
developed electric field that extends throughout the bulk region due to the ferroelec￾tric’s residue left polarization and an accessible voltage (V oc) that can be four or even 
more several orders of scale greater than the ferroelectric’s bandgap energy. This 226 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
allows for extremely high- power conversion efficiencies. One of the most significant 
tasks of the 21st century is to use cheap, effective solar cells to capture the sunlight 
that strikes the earth. Around the world, efforts are being undertaken to overcome 
this obstacle by developing solar cells built of nanostructured magnetic nanomateri￾als ( such as nanoparticles and nanowires). Additionally, it is crucial to note that nano￾structured materials like nanoparticles and nanowires have three distinctive benefits 
that can aid in converting solar energy into electricity. Because the two vital phases 
in converting solar energy into electricity, charge separation and light absorption are 
made possible by the huge surface and interfacial areas that new magnetic nanoparti￾cles offer per unit volume. It is crucial to understand how charge carrier confinement 
in nanometer- sized particles enables materials’ optical and electrical properties to be 
tuned in ways that are not feasible with bulk materials. Certain recently discovered 
quantum mechanical processes, which are seen solely in oxide nanoparticles, can be 
used to push theoretical efficiency boundaries. Last but not least, it required exten￾sive research on magnetic nanostructured materials such as “ magnetic nanoparticle 
inks,” which may help lower the cost of producing solar cells by enabling the mass 
production of thin films at a low cost using w ell- established roll- to- roll coating or 
printing technologies.

The enormous energy requirement by our modern society triggers the materials sci￾entist to search for sustainable energy storage resources [1]. Recently, electrochemical 
capacitors, also called supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, are being commercialized 
due to their high specific power, high specific energy, extraordinary life cycle, and 
obviously low charging time. A simple supercapacitor contains two active electrodes 
immersed in electrolytes and a separator that prevent short circuit. Although the 
electrochemical performance depends on various factors like the type of electrolyte, 
separator, and the design of the device, the active electrode materials play the main 
role. Based on the charge storage mechanism, these active electrode materials are 
primarily categorized into two types such as electrochemical double- layer capaci￾tive ( EDLC) material and pseudocapacitive material [ 2– 5]. Carbonaceous materials 
such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and graphene oxide provide 
capacitance by electrostatically storing charge on the electrode/ electrolyte interface; 
therefore, these materials fall under EDLC. On the contrary, transition metal oxides/ 
hydroxides/ sulfides and conducting polymers fall under pseudocapacitive material. 
They store charge by performing fast faradaic redox reactions with electrolyte ions.
Magnetic nanoparticles ( MNPs) are emerging z ero-d imensional (0 D) nanomateri￾als, which have drawn intense attention from researchers as they have already shown 
remarkable applications in many fields like biomedicine, wastewater treatment, mag￾netic fluid, electrochemical energy storage material, and magnetic resonance imaging 
( MRI) [ 6– 10]. Magnetic transition metal oxides such as spinel ferrites and perovskite 
oxides nanoparticles are a promising class of inorganic materials due to their low cost 
and ease of large-s cale production. These materials have already been established as 
pseudocapacitive electrodes for h igh- performance supercapacitors with high specific 
energy and power and exceptional cyclic stability. Not only that but also MNPs have 
got attention as interesting capacitive electrode materials owing to their magnetic 
 field- dependent behavior toward specific capacitance [ 11– 13]. Therefore, a correla￾tion between the applied magnetic field and the electrochemical reaction occurring Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Energy Storage Applications 231

field on active electrode materials preparation and devices.
in the electrochemical capacitor can be drawn. The effect of the external magnetic 
field is different for different MNPs based on their internal magnetic characteristics. 
Additionally, the magnetic properties of MNPs depend on their size, which is com￾pletely determined by the pathways followed for the synthesis of MNPs [14, 15].
The value of saturation magnetization and coercivity of the MNPs is also equally 
important as based on these values, MNPs respond toward the externally applied 
magnetic field. However, the overall magnetic response of MNPs depends on the 
magnetic domains present in the electrode material. With increasing the magnetic 
field, these domains start aligning, thus reducing the magnetoresistance in ferro￾magnetic materials and improving the charge storage capacity. Sometimes, the func￾tionalization of magnetic nanoparticles with other EDLC and/o r pseudocapacitive 
materials can lead to an increase in the electrochemical performance [13, 16]. Not 
only does the external magnetic field alter the electrochemical performance of MNPs 
but also various types of porous MNPs having different sizes and shapes can be syn￾thesized in presence of a magnetic field (F igure 11.1).
11.2 SYNTHESIS AND SURFACE MODIFICATION OF MNPs
Different methods can be employed to synthesize various types of MNPs with 
varying properties. Generally, all the preparation methods can be categorized into 
three types such as physical methods, chemical methods, and biological methods 
( Figure 11.2). The physical methods generally follow the t op- down strategy, which 
means the nanoparticles are formed from the bulk materials, whereas the chemical 
process is based on a b ottom-u p approach, i.e., nanoparticles develop from the atoms 
or small molecules.232 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
 
FIGURE 11.2 Synthetic routes for MNPs.
11.2.1 p hysiCal Methods
11.2.1.1 Mechanical Ball Milling Method
Ball milling method is a simple and cost- effective “ top-d own” technique used for the 
synthesis of MNPs. This method involves crushing of coarse- textured bulk materials 
into fine- textured MNPs [17]. In 1970, the method was first developed by Benjamin 
[18]. The process is carried out in a small cylindrical jar with several steel balls. 
The bulk materials enclosed in the hollow cylinder are ground by the kinetic energy 
generated due to the collisions between the steel balls and the solid material resulting 
in nano- sized particles. There are numerous types of milling systems (F igure 11.3), 
including planetary and shaker mills [19, 20]. The factors that influence the fabrica￾tion of the MNPs are the size of the balls, milling time, time of vibration, and ball￾t o-p owder ratio. The main drawback of this synthetic technique is the impurity of the 
product [21]. The MNPs obtained by this method have a wide range of size distribu￾tion when compared to that obtained by chemical synthesis.
11.2.1.2 Laser Evaporation
This is a “ b ottom-u p” technique by which nanoparticles are obtained from gaseous 
or liquid precursors via condensation [22]. In this method, MNPs are synthesized by 
fabricating a film and filling the holes in the template using a high- e nergy laser. This 
method is highly efficient for the production of iron oxide MNPs [23]. This process 
involves the evaporation of the coarsed- textured raw materials under the focus of a 
laser beam. The material is kept in a cell immersed in a liquid while pointing toward 
the laser beam. The irradiation of the material by the laser beam in solution results 
in the formation of vapor which is finally cooled down in the gaseous phase. The 
nanoparticles are formed as a result of fast condensation and nucleation [24]. This 
synthetic strategy is useful in the large- scale production of improved quality MNPs 
without using any expensive chemicals or producing any hazardous wastes [25, 26].
11.2.1.3 E lectron Beam Lithography
In this synthetic technique, an electron beam is utilized to transform iron elements 
into iron oxide nanoparticles. Here, the electron beam is passed through the surface Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Energy Storage Applications 233

of an iron particle film to produce Fe3O4 nanoparticles [27]. Although this method 
can easily produce nanoparticles, it also has some demerits such as time consuming, 
expensive, and resolution limitations.
11.2.1.4 Gas-Phase Deposition
This technique can be carried out via chemical vapor deposition ( CVD) or physical 
vapor deposition ( PVD). Both the routes produce products with different shapes and 
sizes. Tyurikova et al. reported aerosol CVD for the synthesis of spherical Fe3O4
 core– carbon shell structures [28]. This method is relatively simple and accomplished 
with lower consumption of reagents. 1D nanostructure of iron oxide can be syn￾thesized by catalyzed CVD method using {Fe(O But)3}2 or Sn(O But)4 precursors on 
 gold-c oated alumina substrate [29]. This is a low cost- e ffective method of synthesis 
for MNPs. However, PVD techniques need a line of sight between the source and the 
surface of the substrate.
11.2.1.5 Wire Explosion Method
This is a new single- s tep physiochemical method for the benign and environmentally 
safe synthesis of MNPs. This method gives high yields and does not require further 
steps, including the separation of the nanoparticles and treatment of the side products. 
The main disadvantage of this method is that the particles obtained by this method 
are not monodispersed [30]. However, Kurlyandskaya et  al. prepared spherical￾s haped iron oxide nanoparticles having size of 10 nm by this method (F igure 11.4). 234 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
 
FIGURE 11.4 Schematic diagram of the wire explosion method.
The metal wire is explored in the explosion chamber to produce the iron vapors, 
which finally formed oxide nanoparticles [31]. The large and small MNPs are accu￾mulated in the cyclone chamber and filter, respectively, by gas flow.
11.2.2 CheMiCal Methods
The chemical methods of synthesis for the MNPs include various “b ottom- up” 
approaches. A brief depiction of some popular chemical methods that are adopted 
for the fabrication of MNPs is provided below.
11.2.2.1 Coprecipitation Method
The coprecipitation method of preparation is the most common method for the pro￾duction of MNPs, specifically when the product is required in large quantities. This 
technique is very much convenient in the preparation of nanoparticles of precise size 
and noble magnetic properties [32]. The precursor metal ion salts are dissolved in 
a suitable solvent and the appropriate precipitating agent is added in order to pro￾duce the desired MNPs. During the coprecipitation, the nature and concentration of 
the metal ions, pH, reaction temperature, etc. play crucial roles in determining the 
chemical composition, shape, and size of the MNPs [33]. Though the coprecipitation 
method is chosen because of its simplicity and the uniform size distribution of the 
MNPs, occasionally, it becomes difficult to regulate the shape of the particles.
11.2.2.2 Thermal Decomposition
Thermal decomposition is highly useful in preparing monodispersed MNPs with 
high crystallinity, definite shape, and precise size distribution. This method involves 
the disintegration of organometallic compounds in presence of suitable organic 
surfactants [34]. This synthetic technique for MNPs utilizes different stabilizing 
agents like fatty acids, oleic acid, and hexadecylamine. The stabilizers can retard the 
nucleation process, which regulates the growth of MNPs having spherical shape and 
desired size. The shape and size of the MNPs are largely controlled by the reaction Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Energy Storage Applications 235
time, temperature, nature of solvents and surfactants, etc. [35, 36]. The thermal 
decomposition technique is considered to be one of the best methods for l arge- scale 
production of MNPs with identical size and regular shape [37]. The generation of 
toxic organic compounds limits the adaptation of this synthetic technique in the bio￾medical field [38]. It is more advantageous than the previous coprecipitation method 
in the case of the synthesis of MNPs of smaller particle sizes.
11.2.2.3 Microemulsion Synthesis
Microemulsions are transparent isotropic dispersion of water and oil mixed with the 
help of a surfactant or occasionally with cosurfactants. Three kinds of microemul￾sions are possible: (a) oil-in-water (O/W) (major part: water, minor part: oil), (b) 
water-in-oil (W/O) (major part: oil, minor part: water), and (c) microemulsions with 
comparable amounts of oil and water. In this method, the size and shape of the MNPs 
are largely dependent on the nature of the microemulsion [39]. Though this method 
results in uniformly dispersed MNPs, the yield is very low.
11.2.2.4 Hydrothermal Method
In the hydrothermal method, highly pure and crystalline materials with controlled 
morphology can be achieved from an aqueous salt solution of metal ions under high 
pressure and high temperature. In this synthetic procedure, MNPs are produced via 
hydrolysis and oxidation reactions. The main advantage of this method is the uniform 
size, structural distribution, and high crystallinity of the product [40]. The crystal￾linity and morphology of the prepared MNPs depend on various factors such as the 
proper choice of solvent ( when the solvent is other than water, the process is called 
solvothermal), time of reaction, pressure, and temperature. As the hydrothermal syn￾thesis is performed at high temperature and pressure, utmost care should be taken 
and it requires special equipment. In spite of these few concerns, this process is often 
preferred compared to other chemical synthetic procedures like microemulsion or 
 sol- gel because of the advantage of fabricating MNPs of desirable size and shape 
with reliable composition [41].
11.2.2.5 Sol-Gel Method
The sol- gel method of synthesis for MNPs involves hydrolysis and polycondensation 
of metal alkoxides at room temperature. At first, a sol is prepared by dissolving the 
metal salt in a suitable solvent. Then, the sol is stirred or heated for enhanced van der 
Waals interaction between the colloidal particles. After that, the solution is dried by 
removing the solvent and a gel is formed. The sol- gel method is a room- temperature 
 cost- effective method, which has control over the shape, size, and composition of 
the MNPs. This method is capable of effectively producing highly pure, crystalline 
MNPs with good yield. However, the sol- gel method suffers from a few drawbacks 
like the formation of byproducts, generation of a 3D oxide network, longer reaction 
time, and use of toxic solvents [6, 42].
11.2.2.6 Electrochemical Deposition
The electrochemical deposition method can be employed for the preparation of highly 
crystalline and pure nanoparticles [43, 44]. By varying the deposition parameters 
 236 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
like potential, current, concentration, and pH of electrolyte, one can control the crys￾tallinity and particle size of the nanoparticles. Karimzadeh et al. prepared magnetic 
Fe3O4 nanoparticles by cathodic electrochemical deposition process [43].
11.2.3 biologiCal Method
Biological method for the synthesis of MNPs involves various living organisms such 
as plants and microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Biocompatible 
MNPs can be developed by this method. This is an efficient, environment- friendly, 
green process, but it suffers from poor dispersion of the nanoparticles [45]. This 
synthetic technique is comparatively new and till now, the mechanism of forma￾tion of the nanoparticles is not clearly understood properly and it demands further 
investigations.
A comparative analysis of various synthetic methods is provided in Table 11.1.
11.2.4 funCtionalization of the Mnps surfaCe
Stability of the MNPs is of major concern for fruitful application of these materials. 
Functionalization is the process by which more surface features are added to the sur￾face of MNPs in order to enhance the stability and broaden the scope of applications. 
Due to the intrinsic hydrophobic nature of the surface MNPs tend to agglomerate 
resulting in larger size particles. Moreover, pristine MNPs are often nonbiocompat￾ible. Therefore, proper modification of the surface is often required to make these

MNPs application friendly. The various surface functionalization techniques for 
MNPs are discussed below.
11.2.4.1 Functionalization with Polymer
MNPs have a tendency to form larger clusters under the influence of magnetic force 
and van der Waal’s force. This phenomenon can be minimized via surface modi￾fication of the MNPs may be performed with different polymers. This technique 
enhances the stability of the MNPs by reducing the average particle diameter and 
polydispersity index. Polymers reported to be used in this functionalization tech￾nique are polyaniline ( PANI), polypyrrole ( PPy), etc. [46, 47]. Besides providing 
extra stability to the nanoparticles, the conducting polymers greatly improve the 
electrochemical performance of the materials. PANI coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles dis￾played specific capacitance of 1,669.18 F g−1 while bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles showed 
1,351.13 F g−1 specific capacitance at similar conditions. The PANI coating also 
enhances the cyclic stability of the material from 92% capacity retention for bare 
Fe3O4 to 96.5% retention in case of Fe3O4/ PANI over 25,000 cycles at a high current 
density ( 15 A g−1).
11.2.4.2 Small Molecule Functionalization
Surface functionalization of the MNPs with small molecules can be achieved by suit￾able chemical reactions. This technique results in improved colloidal stability and 
reduced particle size [48]. Surface modification of Fe3O4 nanoparticles with citrate 
greatly influences the surface area and morphology. Moreover, the citrate modified 
Fe3O4 showed a specific capacitance of 242 F g−1, which is higher than that of the 
bare Fe3O4 ( 112 F g−1). The citrate modification enhances the cyclic stability of the 
material from 35% to 75% over 1,000 cycles.
11.2.4.3 Functionalization with Surfactants
Functionalization of the MNPs surface with surfactants can lead to sufficient repul￾sive interaction within the system to reduce the agglomeration giving a stable colloi￾dal solution. Surfactant modified MNPs are divided into three categories: oil soluble, 
water soluble, and amphiphilic. The surfactants modified MNPs exhibit excellent 
magnetic properties and have various potential applications like energy storage ther￾mal therapy and removal of cationic dyes in sewage. The superparamagnetic Fe3O4
MNPs prepared via cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ( CTAB) assisted method 
records improved specific capacitance of 1,192 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1
[49]. The electrode showed 93% capacity retention over 4,000 cycles with optimum 
CTAB concentration.
11.2.4.4 Functionalization with Transition Metal Oxides/ Hydroxide/ Sulfides
For protecting the surface and increasing the stability of the MNPs, the surface of the 
MNPs is coated with other transition metal oxides/ hydroxide/ sulfides such as NiO, 
MnO2, Co(OH)2, Ni(OH)2, MoS2, Co3S4, and Ni3S2. These functionalized materials 
are not only useful in protecting magnetic characteristics, but also these are reported 
to have improved electrochemical performance due to presence of more number of 
electroactive centers.238 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
11.2.4.5 Functionalization with Silicon Dioxide
The nontoxic nature of silica is exploited in functionalization of MNPs to impart extra 
stability to the nanoparticles. Silica is capable of forming c ross- linking and forming an 
inert coating on the MNPs. This technique is very useful in generating functionalized 
MNPs having potential application in energy storage, catalysis, adsorption, and magnetic 
separation [50]. Co3O4 magnetic nanoparticles embedded in SiO2 matrix were produced 
by citrate- gel method. Electrochemical performance studies confirm the pseudocapaci￾tive nature of the material. A high specific capacitance value of 1,143 F g−1 was obtained 
at a scan rate of 2.5 mV s−1 with excellent cyclic stability (> 92%) over 900 cycles.
11.2.4.6 Functionalization with Carbonaceous Materials
Carbonaceous materials possess some unique features like low density, high strength, 
and exceptional electrical properties. Hence, it is obvious that functionalization 
of MNPs with carbon will impart excellent electrical properties along with mag￾netic permeability. The porous carbon materials like activated carbon, graphene, or 
reduced graphene oxide ( rGO), graphene oxide ( GO), and carbon nanotubes ( CNTs) 
are the most used for the functionalization of MNPs. Being the double- layer capaci￾tive materials, these greatly improve the specific power of the hybrid electrode mate￾rials. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles when inserted into the bowl shaped hollow porous 
carbon nanocapsules ( CNB) with high surface area and high conductivity achieved 
excellent electrochemical performance. The Fe3O4@CNB ( containing 40.3 wt% 
Fe3O4) electrode displayed a high gravimetric capacitance of 466 F g−1 with 92.4% 
capacity retention over 5,000 cycles [51].
11.3 VARIOUS MNPs IN ELECTROCHEMICAL ENERGY STORAGE
The electrochemical performance of M NPs- based supercapacitive electrodes can be 
altered by an external magnetic field or/ and magnetism possessed by the electrode 
materials. However, how the internal magnetic property can influence its e nergy- 
 storing performance has not been completely explored yet. There are mainly fol￾lowing three types of reports describing ( i) investigation of only the electrochemical 
performance of MNPs, ( ii) investigation of the magnetic and electrochemical proper￾ties, but without drawing any correlation between them, and ( iii) influence of exter￾nal magnetic field on the electrochemical performance of MNPs.
Magnetic metal oxide nanoparticles are an emerging class of inorganic materials 
due to their low- cost and easy large- volume synthesis. Spinel ferrites of different 
elements have already been developed as h igh- performance supercapacitor applica￾tions with high specific energy, high specific power, and excellent cyclic stability. 
Furthermore, inorganic perovskite oxides have also attracted great attention toward 
high-performance anion-intercalation supercapacitors.
11.3.1 M etal ferrite nanopartiCles
11.3.1.1 Cobalt Ferrite (CoFe2O4)
Cobalt ferrite possesses an inverse spinel structure [MIII(MIIMIII)O4] in which Co2+
ion is present at the octahedral site and Fe3+ ions are present at both octahedral and 
 Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Energy Storage Applications 239
tetrahedral sites. The ferrite substances have interlocking networks of metal ions and 
oxides [8]. The nanoparticles of CoFe2O4 exhibit ferromagnetic behavior. Guerioune 
et  al. reported superparamagnetic CoFe2O4 nanoparticles fabricated by coprecipi￾tation and hydrothermal methods [52]. They have used various metal ion precur￾sors, i.e., different salts of the metal ions such as chlorides, nitrates, and acetates, 
and employed different reaction conditions. Detailed morphological and structural 
studies concluded the formation of mesoporous cobalt ferrite nanoplatelets. The par￾ticle size varied within the 11– 26 nm range depending on the reaction conditions. 
The material obtained from the hydrothermal method displayed a specific area of 
~34.22 m2 g−1. In a three- electrode cell system, the a s- prepared materials showed a 
high specific capacitance of 429 F g−1 at a specific current of 0.5 A g−1 with excel￾lent cyclic stability combined with capacitance retention of 98.8% after consecutive 
galvanostatic charge- discharge ( GCD) 6,000 cycles. The CoFe2O4-containing nano￾composites possess enhanced capacitance and excellent electrochemical behavior. 
Elseman et al. synthesized CoFe2O4/ carbon sphere nanocomposites via a single- step 
solvothermal procedure where CoFe2O4 nanoparticles are combined with glucose, a 
precursor for the carbon sphere [53]. The electrode displayed appreciable enhance￾ment in the specific capacitance of 600 F g−1, with a 5.9% decrease of its original 
capacitance over 500 cycles showing a specific energy of 27.08 W h kg−1 and a spe￾cific power of 750 W kg−1. The improved electrical conductance of the material is 
ascribed to its hierarchical architecture. The group reported a higher specific capaci￾tance with maximum retention for the composite concluding the potential applica￾tion of the same in supercapacitors. A simple low- cost coprecipitation method was 
followed by Vijayalakshmi et al. for the synthesis of ferromagnetic cobalt ferrite [54]. 
The synthesized CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were calcined at 350°C and the product was 
employed for electrochemical studies in aqueous 1 M KOH solution. The synthesized 
ferrite electrode showed considerably enriched supercapacitive behavior with a spe￾cific capacitance of 1,233 F g−1 at the scan rate of 5 mVs−1 with excellent retention 
(~90%) up to 5,000 GCD cycles.
11.3.1.2 Nickel Ferrite (NiFe2O4)
In nickel ferrites ( NiFe2O4), the ferric ions play a crucial role in modulating the mor￾phology, particle size, and magnetic and electrochemical properties. The magnetic 
interaction arises from the antiparallel arrangement of the spins of Fe3+ in the tetra￾hedral site and that of Ni2+ and Fe3+ in the octahedral site.
In a report by Arun et al., they have synthesized NiFe2O4 by chemical oxidation 
method [55]. They showed that an increase in percentage of Fe3+ ion content from 0 to 
50 results in thorough phase formation and reduction in particle size from 43 to 29 nm, 
respectively, with a reduction in magnetic saturation from 45 to 29 emu g−1. The Currie 
temperature for the material was detected at 584°C. The NiFe2O4 nanoparticles pre￾pared with 50% Fe3+ ion ( NF50) displayed a high specific capacitance of 277 F g−1. 
The asymmetric solid- state cell fabricated with NF50 displayed a maximum specific 
capacitance of 56 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The fabricated NF50 elec￾trode showed an improved energy density of 22.5 Wh Kg−1. The GCD study showed 
126% capacity retention for the asymmetric cell. Bashir et al. reported a facile and 
 environment- friendly procedure for the synthesis of NiFe2O4 MNPs using an aqueous 
 240 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
extract of Persa Americano seeds [56]. The structural characterizations confirmed the 
phase purity and spinel structure of NiFe2O4 MNPs. The band gap energy for bulk 
NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 nanoparticles is calculated to be 3.6 and 4.25 eV, respectively. 
This increment in the band gap can be attributed to the quantum confinement effect 
( QCE) of the nanoparticles. The presence of lower magnetocrystalline anisotropy of 
the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles results in a low value of coercivity. The spin glass behavior 
of the surface having distorted spins that interact with the ferromagnetically aligned 
 core– shell results in a smaller value of saturation magnetization MS of the NiFe2O4
nanoparticles ( 20.4 emu g−1) compared to that of bulk material ( 55 emu g−1). The 
electrochemical characterization of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles confirmed that both 
the charge- transfer and diffusion process control the electrochemical properties. High 
electronic conductivity and improved electrochemical stability make the particles 
a suitable candidate for promising electrochemical applications. Sivakumar et  al. 
reported spinel NiFe2O4/ CNT nanocomposite and NiFe2O4 nanoparticles produced 
by a chemical method [57]. Electrochemical analysis of the materials confirmed the 
pseudocapacitive behavior of the NiFe2O4/ CNT nanocomposite exhibiting a faradic 
energy storage mechanism. The cyclic voltammogram ( CV) and GCD analysis of the 
composite material showed specific capacitance values of 670 F g−1 at a scan rate of 
10 mV s−1 and 343 F g−1 at a 1 A g−1, respectively, with 89.16% capacity retention after 
5,000 GCD cycles. Moreover, the electrochemical analysis also confirmed the supe￾rior capacitive nature of the NiFe2O4/ CNT nanocomposite compared to the NiFe2O4
nanoparticles. The NiFe2O4/ CNT nanocomposite ( as cathode) was then combined 
with activated carbon ( as anode) to fabricate a device which showcased a specific 
capacitance of 85.94 F g−1 at a scan rate of 1 A g−1 with 87.27% retention of capacitance 
after 5,000 cycles. The device displayed a high specific energy of 23.39 W h kg−1 and a 
specific power of 466.66 W kg−1. This study established the potential of NiFe2O4/CNT
nanocomposites as electrode material for energy storage applications.
11.3.1.3 Manganese Ferrite (MnFe2O4)
Arun et al. reported manganese ferrite ( MnFe2O4) MNPs prepared via the chemi￾cal oxidation method [58]. They employed Fe3+ ions during synthesis to reduce the 
size of the nanoparticles. Depending on the amount of Fe3+ ion used, as-prepared 
MnFe2O4 MNPs display saturation magnetization in the range of 45– 67 emu g−1. The 
TEM imaging technique is utilized to investigate the particle size distribution. The 
small MnFe2O4 nanoparticles synthesized by using a high concentration of Fe3+ ion 
showed the highest specific capacitance of 415 F g−1. Hence, it becomes obvious that 
Fe3+ ions can be used to regulate the size of ferrite MNPs and smaller- sized MnFe2O4
MNPs have potential supercapacitor applications.
11.3.1.4 Copper Ferrite (CuFe2O4)
Liang et al. reported copper- based magnetically ordered pseudocapacitor ( MOPC) 
and copper ferrites ( CuFe2O4), which display exciting magnetocapacitive effects 
[59]. The use of chelating molecules like ammonium salt of purpuric acid ( ASPA) 
results in greater active mass loading, which in turn gives improved electrochemi￾cal performance. Electrodes were constructed using CuFe2O4 nanoparticles in com￾bination with multi- walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs) conductive additives. 
 Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Energy Storage Applications 241
Electrodes were fabricated by varying the amount of MWCNTs, which resulted 
in specific capacitance values in the range of 0.04 to 2.76 F cm−2 at a scan rate of 
2 mV s−1. The electrode with the maximum capacitance of 2.76 F cm−2 exhibited 
25.7% capacity retention at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The improved pseudocapac￾ity of CuFe2O4 nanoparticles in combination with magnetic properties established 
CuFe2O4 nanoparticles as a promising material for negative electrodes in superca￾pacitors. Piao et al. reported a copper ferrite- attached graphene nanosheet ( CuFe2O4- 
 GN) synthesized via a single- s tep solvothermal process in which the graphene oxide 
is reduced to graphene simultaneously with the production of CuFe2O4 nanoparticle 
[60]. The morphological analysis of the composite nanosheets confirmed that the 
CuFe2O4 nanoparticles of a diameter of ~100 nm were well grafted on GN. The reac￾tion parameters that influence the shape and size of the nanoparticles are the concen￾tration of the starting material, precipitating agent, stabilizing agent, and graphene 
oxide. The CV and GCD analysis for investigating the electrochemical properties of 
the CuFe2O4- G N composite displayed high specific capacitance of 576.6 F g–1 at a 
scan rate 1 A g–1, good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability. The CuFe2O4– 
 GN composite has promising applications in electrochemical capacitors due to the 
excellent synergism between graphene and the nanoparticles.
11.3.2 the effeCt of external MagnetiC field
A stable magnetic field may alter the performance of a supercapacitor mainly con￾structed by magnetic transition metal oxide electrode by changing some parameters 
such as Lorentz force, Nernst layer, and m agneto- dielectric constant. The Lorentz 
force applying on a moving charge particle can be expressed as follows:
 F q L = + E q    ( ) v B × (11.1)
where q is the charge, E
 
 is the applied electric field, v
 
 is the velocity of the charge, and 
B
 
 is the applied magnetic field. In absence of magnetic field (B
 
= 0), only qE
 
 contrib￾utes toward specific capacitance at applied potential. In presence of magnetic field, 
the charge particles experience an additional force, Lorentz force F
 
L, which helps in 
easy intercalation of charge carriers into the electrode, resulting in the improvement 
of capacitance. With increasing the magnetic field, the magnetic domains present 
in electrode material start aligning, which reduces the magnetoresistance in fer￾romagnetic materials and improves the charge storage capacity [61]. The magnetic 
 nano- leaflets consist of small domains revealing localized magnetic moments inde￾pendently. The random domains are aligned under an external magnetic field and 
possess a net magnetization in the direction of the external field ( F igure 11.5). This 
alignment of domains in one direction offers free movement of electrons from one 
domain to other and improves charge storage properties.
Furthermore, the magnetic attraction force increases the kinetic energy, resulting 
in the increment of the effective flux of the electrolyte ions under a magnetic field. 
The magnetohydrodynamic ( MHD) effect enhances the limiting current by decreas￾ing the Nernst layer. Therefore, MHD lowers the Rct and modifies the diffusion cur￾rent and the electrochemical performance as well [62].242 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
Various postulates have been considered for explaining the change in electro￾chemical performance of an electrode under magnetic field. The electrode having 
high specific surface area allows deeper penetration of electrolyte ions under a mag￾netic field resulting high capacitance. Reduction of the Nernst layer at the e lectrode– 
 electrolyte interface under a stable magnetic environment results in enhancement 
of the capacitance. The Lorentz force, operated along the diagonal direction, 
enhances the electrolyte’s convection, which decreases the electrolyte’s resistance 
and therefore greater diffusion of the ions results in the enhanced pseudocapacitance. 
Furthermore, the gradient force accumulates electrolytic ions indicating improved 
double-layer capacitance.

So, not only the specific surface area and the pore structure of the electrode mate￾rials, but also electrical, internal magnetic properties and applied external magnetic 
field affect the electrochemical performance [63]. Along with this, the size, mobility, 
and diffusion of the electrolyte ions also play a crucial role in determining the overall 
performance of a supercapacitor device.
11.3.3 spinel oxide nanopartiCles
11.3.3.1 Iron Oxide (Fe3O4)
Magnetite (Fe3O4) has been extensively investigated due to its high natural abun￾dance, unique electrical and magnetic properties, and eco- friendliness. The unique 
electrical and magnetic properties of the cubic inverse spinal magnetite are caused 
by the hopping of electrons between Fe3+ and Fe2+ at octahedral sites. Wang et al. 
reported AC/Fe3O4 NPs nanocomposites by simple hydrothermal method followed 
by ultrasonication [16]. Among the as- prepared magnetized and nonmagnetized 
electrodes, magnetized electrodes exhibited high electrochemical performance. The 
 micro- m agnetic field by each Fe3O4 NPs produced a stable magnetic field, which 
enhanced the energy state of electrons under the Lorentz force, and the transporta￾tion efficacy of the electrons was greatly improved as well. Furthermore, the stable 
magnetic field improves the electrical conductivity of the electrolytes by changing 
their microscopic structure. These two factors help to improve the overall perfor￾mance of the supercapacitor by reducing the internal c harge- transfer resistance. 
The specific capacitance improvement of magnetized active carbon/ Fe3O4 NPs was 
enhanced by 33.1% at a specific current density of 1 A g−1, and the specific energy 
was increased to 15.97 Wh kg−1.
Pal et al. synthesized pure Fe3O4 nanoparticles and Fe3O4/ reduced graphene oxide 
( rGO) hybrid by hydrothermal method and investigated its electrochemical perfor￾mance in an external magnetic field ( 0.125 T) ( F igure 11.6) [13]. The composite elec￾trode exhibited specific capacitance of 451 and 868.89 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1
without and with the magnetic field, respectively. That means the hybrid electrode 
exhibited 1.93 times higher capacitance under magnetic field. The reason behind the 
improvement of electrochemical activity is described as that Fe3O4/rGO composite
having high specific surface area allows the deeper penetration of electrolyte ions 
under the magnetic field. The composite achieved high specific energy of 120.68 Wh 
kg−1 and high specific power of 3.91 kW kg−1 in the presence of magnetic field.
Sinan et al. reported Fe3O4 nanospheres having a diameter of ~10 nm synthesized 
via coprecipitation method [64]. The as- prepared Fe3O4 nanospheres are bifunctional 
in nature and display a superparamagnetic behavior with saturation magnetization 
(Ms
) value of 64 emu g−1 at 298 K and show soft ferromagnetic behavior with Ms value 
of 71 emu g−1 at 10 K. They integrated the pseudocapacitive Fe3O4 nanoparticles into 
hazelnut shell via hydrothermal carbonization process in presence of MgO ceramic 
templates resulting in a hierarchical porous structure of Fe3O4/C nanocomposite.
The composite has a large specific surface area of 344 m2 g−1 is capable of combining 
the EDL characteristic properties of carbon with the faradic pseudocapacitance of 
Fe3O4. The material displayed a specific capacitance of 136 F g−1 at a scan rate of 1 
A g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The resultant specific energy and specific power are

estimated to be 27.2 Wh kg−1 and 705.5 W kg−1, respectively. Moreover, the composite 
exhibited improved cycling stability with no capacitance loss after 1,000 cycles at 2 
A g−1. The Fe3O4/C na nocomposite reported here produced higher specific energy in 
comparison to other reported composites of Fe3O4 with other carbonaceous materials 
like graphene, nanotubes, etc. The As Fe3O4/ C nanocomposite is capable of working 
within a large negative potential of −1.2 to 0 V. Thus, it is possible to fabricate asym￾metric supercapacitor devices by combining it with suitable positive electrodes.
The magnetic nanoparticles are mainly functionalized to improve their proper￾ties. Functionalized Fe3O4@D-NH2 MNPs are reported combining Fe3O4 nanopar￾ticles with10-arm–NH2 terminated polyamidoamine (P AMAM) dendrimer having a 
diethylenetriamine core [65]. The facile electron transfer between the surface and the 
core of the dendrimer is useful for energy storage applications. When this dendrimer 
is combined with Fe3O4 nanoparticles having high porosity and larger surface area, 
it results in excellent electronic properties in Fe3O4@D-NH2 nanocomposite. The 
Fe3O4@D-NH2 electrode recorded a specific capacitance of 70– 120 F g−1 depend￾ing on the material loading. The elevated specific capacitance and improved charge/ 
discharge rate make the Fe3O4@D-NH2 composite an excellent candidate for energy 
storage applications.Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Energy Storage Applications 245
Octahedral magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles can also be synthesized by a simple 
chemical oxidation method [66]. Arun et al. have then modified the as- synthesized 
nanoparticles with carbon using sugar solution at different temperatures. Carbon￾modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles prepared at 600°C, with an average grain size of 
40 nm showed large magnetic saturation of 87 emu g−1. The potential of the ca rbon￾modified Fe3O4 MNPs for the negative electrode in supercapacitors was investigated. 
The uncovered Fe3O4 has a capacitance value of 148 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, 
whereas the carbon- m odified hybrid materials exhibit a high specific capacitance 
of 274 F g−1. The enhancement in capacitance is due to the synergistic effect of the 
EDLC property of carbon and faradic process at the Fe3+/Fe2+ active sites in pseudo￾capacitive iron oxide. The magnetite Fe3O4 particles display bifunctional material, 
and particle size plays a crucial role in regulating the superparamagnetic or ferro￾magnetic behavior [67].
11.3.3.2 Cobalt Oxide (Co3O4)
Cobalt oxide nanoparticles prepared by chemical reflux are reported to exhibit super￾capacitive nature [68]. Packiaraj et al. fabricated Co3O4 nanoparticles with hexagonal 
 flakes- like morphology. Magnetic characterization using a vibrating sample magne￾tometer ( VSM) confirms the paramagnetic nature of the nanoparticles. The electro￾chemical studies with Co3O4 nanoparticles- based electrodes record a high specific 
capacitance of 1,413 F g−1 at a specific current of 1 A g−1 and 98.4% retention after 
1,000 cycles. The quantum confinement effect in cubic phase of Co3O4 nanoparticles 
is confirmed by a blue shift in the band gap energy calculated from the electronic 
absorption spectrum with a broad emission peak in UV/ violet region [69].
Vijayakumar et al. reported a specific capacitance of 519 F g−1 for Co3O4 nanopar￾ticles with 1.3% capacitance degradation after 1,000 cycles. UmaSudharshini et al. 
synthesized Co3O4 nanoparticles by a solvothermal technique by using a mixture of 
acetylacetonate salts of CoII and CoIII ions [70]. The spinel Co3O4 shows nanosheet- 
 like morphology for crystallites of size 40 nm. From UV– vis– DRS studies, two band 
gap energies are calculated at 1.33 and 2.25 eV, which are assigned to O2−→Co2+
and O2−→Co3+ possible charge- transfer processes. The occurrence of two band gaps 
confirms the nature of the as- prepared material to be a p- type semiconductor in 
nature. With increasing reaction temperature, the crystallite size increases, which in 
turn decreases the band gap energies. The material synthesized at low temperature 
records a specific capacitance of 778 F g−1. Due to finite shape, size, and uncompen￾sated spins on the surface, Co3O4 nanoparticles display weak ferromagnetic interac￾tion, which is beneficial for electrical and electromechanical applications.
11.3.3.3 Manganese Oxide (Mn3O4)
Mn3O4 NPs have already been investigated as promising electrode materials for 
supercapacitors due to their low cost, easy synthesis, and high pseudocapacitance. 
Shah et  al. reported a unique s quare- shaped Mn3O4 NPs produced by a simple 
hydrothermal process [71]. The porous architecture of Mn3O4 NPs helps to achieve 
high electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 380 F g−1 at 
1.0 mA cm−2 current. The Mn3O4 NPs also showed excellent electrochemical sta￾bility. The electrochemical performance can be further improved by combining it

with MWCNT ( Mn3O4@MWCNT) [72]. The synergistic effect between the highly 
conductive EDLC- type material MWCNT and pseudocapacitive Mn3O4 results in 
improvement in overall performance.
Not always external magnetic field improves the specific capacitance; sometimes, 
it reduces the electrochemical performances. For example, Mn3O4 NPs show a 
decrease in the specific capacitance in presence of magnetic field [11]. It is discussed 
earlier that the dimension of Nernst’s layer gets reduced in presence of external mag￾netic field (F igure 11.7a and b). Accordingly, the flow of electrolyte ions increased 
and the specific capacitance thereof. However, growth in the magneto-d ielectric con￾stant leads to a decrease in charge collection, thereby enhancing the insulating nature 
of the material ( Figure 11.7c). The Mn3O4 nanoparticles reported by Haldar et al. 
show a specific capacitance of ∼290 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and ∼221 F g−1
at a specific current of 0.5 A g−1.
11.3.3.4 N ickel Manganese Oxide (N iMn2O4)
The spinel NiMn2O4 possesses interesting magnetic properties along with electri￾cal properties. The various kinds of magnetic interaction arise from the superex￾change phenomena via the oxide ion present in Mn2+-O2−-Mn3+, Mn3+-O2−-Mn3+, 
and Mn3+-O2-Mn4+ units. Moreover, the oxidation states of the manganese ion and 
thereby the oxygen deficiencies can be regulated by choosing appropriate synthetic 
techniques. Bhagwan et  al. synthesized spinel ferromagnetic NiMn2O4 nanofibers 
via the electrospinning method [73]. The mesoporous nanofibers comprise intercon￾nected NiMn2O4 nanoparticles, which act as intercalation sites for electrolytes ions 
and improve specific capacitance of 410 (±5) F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Ray et al. reported the 
fabrication of spinel metal oxide NiMn2O4 nanoparticles and the investigation of the 
electrochemical properties [74]. They have used the s ol- g el method for the synthesis 
of the NiMn2O4 nanospheres of ~8 nm diameter. The materials showed exceptional 
electrochemical properties associated with good rate capability. The electrode fabri￾cated with the as- p repared nanomaterials showed a specific capacitance of 875 F g−1
at 2.0 mV s−1 scan rate. The asymmetric supercapacitor designed using the mate￾rial is capable of working in a wide potential window of 1.8 V and shows a specific Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles for Energy Storage Applications 247 TABLE 11.2 Various MNPs with Their Synthetic Routes, Morphology, Magnetic Properties, and Electrochemical Performance Magnetic Properties Saturation Remanent Coercive Morphology and Magnetization Magnetization Field Nanoparticles Synthesis Method Particle Size ( nm) (Ms, emu g−1) (Mr, emu g−1) (Hc, Oe) Electrolyte Capacitance Ref.

energy of 75.01 W h kg−1 at specific power of 2,250.91 W kg−1. The results conclude 
that the porous NiMn2O4 nanospheres are excellent candidates for energy storage 
applications. Dhas et al. reported a simple s ol- gel method of preparation of NiMn2O4
and studied their electrochemical efficiency, which was found to be highly monitored 
by calcination temperature and electrolyte concentration [75]. All the electrochemi￾cal investigations were carried out in a three- electrode system using a KOH elec￾trolyte. They prepared three different powder materials at three different annealing 
temperatures (500°C, 600°C, and 700°C) and named them as NMO1, NMO2, and 
NMO3, respectively. NMO1 having crystalline particles of 10 nm size shows a high 
specific capacitance of 571 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The specific capacitance 
of the electrode further increases from 571 to 762 F g−1 when the concentration of 
the KOH electrolyte is changed from 1 to 6 M, respectively. This enhancement in 
capacitance value can be credited to excellent electrochemical utilization and effec￾tive charge storage phenomenon.
11.4 CORRELATION BETWEEN THE MORPHOLOGY, 
SIZE OF THE MNPs WITH THEIR MAGNETIC 
AND ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES
The various processing method produces MNPs with different size and morphol￾ogy by simply altering the synthesis parameters. These MNPs show different physi￾cal properties including magnetic properties and electrochemical performances 
( T able  11.2). The specific capacitance of a material can be enhanced by creating 
unique morphology with large specific surface area ( SSA) or by reducing the size of 
the material providing large SSA. Thirumurugan et al. showed that the reduction in 
size ( 50 nm to 14 nm) is beneficial for the improvement of capacitance ( 110 to 415 F 
g−1) with the reduction of the value of Ms and Mr
 [58].
11.5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE OUTLOOK
The use of MNPs as active electrode material in energy storage applications espe￾cially in supercapacitors was reviewed. The different synthetic routes for the prepa￾ration of various MNPs with different morphology and magnetic properties were 
discussed. The effect of the external magnetic field on the specific capacitance of 
various MNPs and their composite was reviewed. However, extensive research is 
needed to fully understand the mechanism behind the alteration of the electrochemi￾cal performance. More optimization is required in order to commercialize the MNPs 
as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.

12.1 INTRODUCTION
Current data creation and consumption trends indicate that the devices and stor￾age media which we use would need further physical space. Every day, 2.5 quin￾tillion bytes of human and machine- generated data were produced at our current 
rate, and the rate is increasing continuously. The amount of data generated in 2020 
was expected to touch 35 trillion gigabytes ( ZB), but nearly 33 ZB were touched in 
2018 itself, prompting the International Data Corporation ( IDC) to revise its estimate 
for 2025. Magnetic media such as magnetic drum memory, magnetic core memory, 
magnetic tape, hard disk drive ( HDD), magnetic stripe, and floppy disk drives were 
used in the early days of data storage ( FDD). Magnetic tapes and HDDs were widely 
used as magnetic storage devices with long term backup retention and large stor￾age capacity after the evolution of magnetic data storage devices over the last few 
decades [1, “ Advanced Control Systems for Data Storage on Magnetic Tape: A L ong- 
 Lasting Success Story [President’s Message],” in IEEE Control Systems Magazine, 
42 ( 2022) 8– 11, doi: 10.1109/ MCS.2022.3171472.]. Industrialists were constantly 
interested in the expansion of new materials and procedures for the fabrication of 
advanced magnetic tape and HDDs to increase storage capacity while reducing size, 
cost per bit of stored data, access time, and data rate. The breakthrough in magnetic 
materials and disk drive fabrication technology enabled large capacity at low cost, 
allowing room- size computers in “ glass houses” to be replaced by portable devices 
such as iPods and laptops [2].
Magnetic memory devices in general used ferromagnetic materials that contained 
magnetic domains with unpaired electrons. By magnetizing the spins in the domains 
“ ascending” and “ descending,” which correspond to the binary system’s 1s and 0s, 
information in terms of bytes can be recorded on ferromagnetic media [3]. The 
beauty of magnetic materials is that they can store and retrieve data in the same way 
it was recorded. By shrinking to the nanoscale, magnetic material’s remarkable prop￾erties and advantages over their bulk behavior can be realized. There are many func￾tional magnetic materials with interesting properties such as magnetostriction, giant 
magneto resistance, magnetic refrigeration, and magnetic fluidity. The processing of 
bulk materials into various shapes with dimensions of a few nanometers resulted in 
materials with desired properties for various applications.
Advances in materials science have resulted in the development of new technolo￾gies in disk drive design, such as giant magnetoresistance ( GMR), thin- film head, 
magnetoresistance head, magnetic recording media, and magnetic tunnel junction 
( MTJ) heads. As a result, a diverse range of magnetic materials, such as soft mag￾netic materials with high magnetization for writing heads, and antiferromagnetic 
alloys with high blocking temperature and low susceptibility for pinning films in 
GMR sensors are demonstrated for the advancement of magnetic recording. The 
development of n ano- engineered organic, inorganic, and hybrid o rganic– inorganic 
composite magnetic materials based on spintronics/ quantum developments has 
grown in popularity and has aided recent density advances [4].Functionalized Magnetic Nanomaterials for Data Storage Applications 257
12.1.1 MagnetiC data storage
A vast amount of data was stored on audio players, mobile phones, personal and 
commercial computers, Web 2.0 apps, corporate storage systems, and numerous 
similar applications using magnetic storage devices and related systems, which were 
virtually ubiquitous in our digital life. The rise of digital media storage and the need 
for low- cost storage have resulted in rapid increases in storage capacity as well as 
reductions in size and cost per GB of data [5]. Valdemar Poulsen invented the use 
of magnetic medium to record and reproduce information in 1898 for telegraphone.
The evolution of this fundamental device culminated in the HDD ( IBM 350), 
which was commercialized in 1955 and reached its current stage after many years of 
technological advancements. Other emerging technologies, in addition to magnetic 
storage devices, include optical, magneto- optical, electronic, electro- mechanical, and 
molecular data storage. Among these, optical storage was widely used due to its low 
cost, portability, and market in audio and video prerecording. However, optical disk 
storage was inferior to magnetic hard disk storage in every way because of its low 
performance, high cost per read/ write head, and limited capacity, making it unsuitable 
for the nonremovable online data storage slots occupied by magnetic hard disks [6].
Magnetic storage/ recording technology showed numerous challenges, and the 
demand continues to rise because of the increase in digital data stored on the inter￾net. As a result, storage management issues such as reliability, scalability, and per￾formance have arisen in digital data storage and archival libraries that use hard disk 
drive arrays. In comparison to the original IBM 305 drive, modern hard disk drives 
have about 8 folds of magnitude greater bit areal densities and are 8 folds of magni￾tude lighter [7]. The progress in hard disk drive bit areal density over the last h alf- 
 century has been faster than Moore’s law and has continued to grow at a slow rate. 
After the beginning of t hin- film- based writing heads, GMR sensors, and advanced 
digital recording tracks with thin sputtered media in the 1990s, bit areal density 
increased rapidly. Recent MRAM technologies based on magneto resistive ( MR) 
effect provided nonvolatile magnetic recording media with the speed and density of 
 semiconductor- based memory devices, static and dynamic RAM [8].
Further efforts to increase the bit areal density resulted in the concept of super￾paramagnetic grains, in which, each data set was made up of individual grains 
with diameters of 8 nm or less. With technologies such as exchange coupled com￾posite ( ECC) media patterned media, perpendicular recording media, HAMR, and 
MARM, the superparamagnetic limit, difficulties in scaling of bit size to grain size 
ratio, and less thermal stability, these limitations were overcome. Many of these hard 
disk drive technologies have got applications in magnetic tape machinery to increase 
storage performance, capacity, and utilization. The expansion of magnetic recording 
skill, which increases the total quantity of bits that can be recorded on a single drive, 
creates new difficulties for the efficient reading and writing of vast volumes of data 
that flow into and out of the read channel. Thus, it is worthwhile to discuss the major 
technological and materials advances that have already been made, as well as future 
technologies, to meet the challenges of producing magnetic storage devices with high 
capacity, low cost, and improved performance.258 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
12.1.2 utilization of MagnetiC nanoMaterials
Magnetic nanoparticles ( MNPs), which display a unique magnetic characteristics 
that distinguish them from their bulk counterparts, have received a significant con￾sideration in the last 2 decades and were becoming increasingly significant in a vari￾ety of solicitations from storage and recording media to biomedical devices [ 9– 1 4]. 
MNP’s basic properties, such as saturation magnetization ( Ms), susceptibility (χ), 
spin lifetime (τ), coercivity ( H), and blocking temperature ( T), were greatly influ￾enced by nano- s caling laws [15]. The magnetization and control of magnetic charac￾teristics from the ferromagnetic to the superparamagnetic regimes were determined 
by the size, shape, and volume of magnetic particles. Below a critical size, ranging 
from 2 to 20 nm in diameter, multi- domain MNPs were converted to single domains, 
resulting in unusual magnetic properties such as superparamagnetism and quantum 
tunneling of magnetization.
MNPs were developed by combining magnetic metal elements, composites, metal 
alloys, and/ or their oxides [ 16– 19]. Since 2000, the nanostructures of Fe, Co, and their 
alloys FePt and CoPt have been the most extensively studied magnetic materials for 
magnetic recording and storage applications. The conventional materials used in h igh- 
 density magnetic recording devices were γ-Fe2O3, CrO2, and Co-γ-Fe2O3. Another 
group of magnetic materials that drew a lot of attention was spinel ferrite MFe2O4
(M=Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Zn, and so on) [ 20– 23]. The MNPs can be developed from sev￾eral metal precursors, composites, metal alloys and/ or their oxides with magnetic 
characteristics. High-density recording applications for audio/video, high-density
digital recording disks, and high- speed digital magnetic tape attracted a lot of inter￾est in spinel ferrites. Furthermore, the nanoparticle’s self- assembled two- dimensional 
structure has demonstrated their fundamental and technological interest in ultrahigh 
density recording media. The widely accepted goal of higher areal density necessi￾tates the arrangement of extremely small magnetic bits and grains in two dimensions 
with out- of- plane magnetization, resulting in the development of a new concept of 
 bit- patterned media in which function of individual nanoparticle as single bit [24].
12.1.3 MagnetiC data storage MeChanisM
The general mechanism of magnetic storage was magnetization of the recording 
medium with corresponding electric strength of the information using an electro￾magnet as a reading head, and the reverse in case of reading the stored informa￾tion. Magnetic tape storage uses magnetic material in the form of tape that runs at 
a constant speed and was magnetized by a static writing head with a current equal 
to the amount of data to be stored. Tape storage has two data storage methods based 
on the direction of the head movement: linear serpentine and helical scanning. 
( Figure 12.1). The helical scanning process comprises laying down tracks side by 
side at a particular angle to the edge of a tape using head mounted on a rotating 
scanner, as opposed to the linear serpentine process, which involved laying down 
a significant number of tracks in a linear way alongside the length of the tape from 
one end to the other and then in the opposite direction after the head was readjusted 
laterally across the tape [25].Functionalized Magnetic Nanomaterials for Data Storage Applications 259

techniques. Reproduced with permission from [25] copyright ( 2006) Springer.
Magnetic hard drives were made up of two main components: magnetic medium 
and recording head. The recording head or slider was used to both record and read 
data from the disk. An electrical pulse equivalent to the digitalized data was applied 
over copper coil, which produces a magnetic flux that changes the state of the mag￾netization direction of a small area of magnetic medium, a magnetic layer on a rigid 
disk, below the write head as one bit, during the data recording process on hard disk. 
By using a massive magnetoresistance sensor to detect magnetism in the recording 
medium and generate an output voltage in the read head, the stored data was recov￾ered. To store digital data, a magnetic recording system was used, and the current 
supplied to the write head was encoded as pulses to signify the digital data ( 1s or 0s) 
[26, 27]. A track was a series of bits recorded onto a rotating disk at a given radius. 
The linear density of the bits recorded down the track was decided by the intervals 
between the writer and reader. The width of the write head determined the track 
width, and the product of these two determined the areal storage density. Disk drives 
have distinct t hin- film structures for the write and read heads that are placed on the 
backside of a mechanical slider that glides over the disk’s surface utilizing a hydrody￾namic air bearing. Without external power supply to the hard disk, the magnetization 
of the magnetic medium remained stable over years. MRAM’s digital storage was 
analogous to magnetic hard disk drives and was considered a nonvolatile memory 
device. Two recording methods have been commercialized based on the direction of 
magnetization with respect to the surface of the magnetic medium. The conventional 
method of recording in a disk drive was longitudinal recording, in which the easy 
axis of magnetization of the recording medium was parallel to its surface, whereas 
the recently used perpendicular recording method (P MR) had the easy axis of mag￾netization perpendicular to the surface of the recording medium. PMR reduced the 
area of each bit, resulting in an increase in the recording medium’s areal density [4].
Many technological advances in materials, mechanisms, and device structure 
have been observed to improve the capacity and performance of magnetic data stor￾age devices. This chapter discusses the various fabrication routes of MNPs and thin 
films, as well as their functionalization with organic/ inorganic molecules to tailor 
key magnetic parameters such as magnetic anisotropy, Hc, Ms, and susceptibility. 
Magnetic nanostructure functionalization has numerous proven advantages in bio￾medical applications. However, this is still a novel approach in the development of 260 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
magnetic storage devices. As a result, this section provides insight into the use of 
functionalized magnetic materials in magnetic data storage devices.
12.2 S YNTHESIS/ PREPARATION OF MAGNETIC NANOMATERIALS
Despite the rapid evolution of research in MNPs/ thin films, more development in syn￾thesis approaches is emerging to find the best synthesis methods that produce high- 
 quality NPs. The last decade has seen extensive research into various approaches 
for the creation of MNPs. To produce MNPs, the common methods are ball milling, 
coprecipitation, hydrothermal, thermal decomposition, sol- gel method, microemul￾sion, and biological method. The schematic of the methods used for the formation of 
MNPs is shown in Figure 12.2.
12.2.1 thin- filM teChniQues
Laser ablation deposition ( LAD) in which a powerful laser beam impinges on a tar￾get, causing material to be ejected and gathered on an appropriate substrate, leading 
to the formation of a thin layer. When compared to sputtering, the laser ablation 
technique has some advantages, such as a faster deposition rate, a better reflection of 
the target composition, and the absence of gas stress during film formulation. The 
FIGURE 12.2 Methods for the preparation of magnetic nanoparticlesFunctionalized Magnetic Nanomaterials for Data Storage Applications 261
material, which is positioned at the bottom of a cell submerged in a liquid solution, 
absorbed the incident laser beam, causing a heat wave that resulted in the plume for￾mation. This plume is ejected into the liquid, where it aggregates to form NPs. This 
method is less expensive than wet chemistry methods for synthesizing a range of par￾ticles with size control, and it does not require reducing agents or produce hazardous 
waste. This method is suitable for producing thin films/ NPs with high magnetization 
of magnetic metal alloys, metal oxides, and ferrite.
Sputtering is a physical vapor deposition process that deposits materials onto a 
desired substrate by ejecting atoms from that material and condensing those ejected 
atoms under high vacuum conditions. This method yielded thin films ranging in 
thickness from a few nanometers to a few micrometers. The sputtering apparatus 
includes an annealing furnace for predeposition annealing of the NPs. The reduction 
in particle size required to achieve this goal has an impact on thermal instability 
and magnetic anisotropy. Sputtering is one of the most effective one- step methods 
for producing self- a ssembled metal and metal alloy NPs. Sputtering could be used 
to create h igh- density FePt nanodot arrays with porous aluminum templates at a 
density of 1012 dots/in2. Porous anodic alumina ( PAA) templates are made by dc 
anodizing aluminum foil in acidic solutions. Under the right conditions, hexagonally 
close packed pore arrays with adjustable size and periodicity could be produced and 
attached to glass or Si/ SiO2 substrates. Sputtering ( Fe/ Pt) n multilayers and remov￾ing the PAA templates produces FePt nanodot arrays and the thickness were varied 
between 500 and 2,000 nm by varying the number of recurrences [28]. Sputtering is 
used to prepare a patterned FePt nanodot array that stores each data bit in isolated 
dots at an ultrahigh density of beyond 1 Tbit/ in2. In this process, a 70 nm- thick CrV 
film is sputtered on glass as a seed layer, and a type of positive E- beam resist ( ER) is 
encrusted on CrV film. E- b eam exposure is used to define a regular array of circular 
holes with fixed sizes, and then a 7 nm FePt is sputtered- d eposited at RT under high 
vacuum. After the acetone lift- o ff process, the regular array of FePt of uniform size 
is obtained. Postannealing at 400°C aids in the phase conversion of FePt from A1 to 
L10 [29]. Similarly, FePt/ C and CoPt/ C films are deposited onto Si ( 111) substrates 
by dc magnetron sputtering from solid CoPt ( FePt) and C targets at a pressure of 
5 m. Torr in a high purity Argon gas flow. FePt/ C films with high magnetic order￾ing and distinctive characteristics were produced by direct deposition of FePt and C 
onto warmed substrates at temperatures exceeding 450°C, whereas ordered fct FePt 
particles are produced by sputtering at high substrate temperatures.
12.2.2 CheMiCal synthesis Methods
Coprecipitation is the most used s olution- b ased method for preparing metal oxide, 
ferrites, and perovskites NPs. This method requires careful adjustment of the solution 
pH and reaction temperature. When large quantities of nanocrystals are required, the 
synthesis of MNPs via coprecipitation is accessible and simple. Metal nitrates, ace￾tates, and chlorides are commonly used as precursors in this method, while ammonia 
and NaOH are frequently used as a precipitating agent and pH controller. For exam￾ple, ferric, manganese ( II) chloride as metal precursors and NaOH as precipitants 
could be used in the preparation of manganese ferrite ( MnFe2O4) NPs. This method 262 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
could be used to prepare NPs of CoFe2O4, MnFe2O4, and Fe3O4. The chemical com￾position, particle size, and shape of materials prepared using this method are defined 
by pH, the type and fraction of the salts, and the temperature.
Hydrothermal method is solution- based synthesis method for producing MNPs 
on a large scale at high pressure and temperature. Hydrolysis and oxidation reactions 
occur during the hydrothermal process to produce NPs. By choosing the suitable 
solvent combination and adjusting parameters such as pressure, temperature, and 
time, this method can produce fine MNPs with controllable size, size distribution, 
and shape. The hydrothermal method was used to create NPs of Fe3O4 NPs of 15 nm 
size and spherical shape, as well as Chitosan- coated Fe4O3 NPs of 25 nm. As shown 
in Figure 12.3, nanocrystalline and mesoporous NiFe2O4 particles of 5 – 8 nm were 
synthesized utilizing supramolecular assembly as a structure directing agent [31]. 
Under alkaline pH, an anionic surfactant assembly of lauric acid could work together 
with the positively charged metal centers of NiFe2O4 species through electrostatic 
exchanges, which is intended to stabilize the material’s mesophase.
Other method used to prepare MNPs is sol- gel process and the whole chemistry 
of the sol- gel process involves the gel development at RT via hydrolysis and metal 
FIGURE 12.3 Steps involved in the formation NiFe2O4 NPs by using lauric acid as tem￾plate and its interesting memory effect as a consequence of interparticle interaction of self- 
 assembled NP. Reprinted with permission from [30] ( 2016) Royal Society of Chemistry.Functionalized Magnetic Nanomaterials for Data Storage Applications 263
alkoxide polycondensation reactions. To prepare a colloidal, metallic precursors 
are mixed in water or other solvents and homogeneously dispersed. Particles con￾nect due to the van der Waals forces, and this contact gets stronger as the tempera￾ture increases. In order to create gel, the mixture must be heated until the solvent 
has been evaporated and the solution has dried. This method is useful for produc￾ing large quantities of MNPs with controlled size and well- defined shape. The 
benefits of this process, such as its simplicity, low cost, and low reaction tempera￾ture, made it more suitable for the formulation of NPs without the use of special￾ized equipment. However, occasionally, contamination from byproduct reactions 
occurs with this approach, necessitating retreatment to generate pure MNPs. The 
disadvantage of this method is that it requires a longer reaction time and uses toxic 
organic solvents.
 Microwave- assisted synthesis is a relatively new technique for producing fine￾grained NPs. Energy is delivered directly to materials in a microwave system via 
molecular interaction with electromagnetic radiation, which generates heat. The 
benefit of this method is that the temperature used is in the range of 100°C–200°C 
for a very short time ( no more than 10 minutes), allowing for easy removal of vapor 
produced during microwave heating. This method can be used in industrial applica￾tions to mass produce NPs with uniform size distribution, high quality, and improved 
reproducibility. M icrowave- a ssisted rapid synthesis was demonstrated to create fine 
NPs of spinel ferrites from 3 to 5 nm, stabilized by oleic acid, oleyl amine, and trioc￾tylphosphine oxide [32]. This method could be used to create Fe3O4, γ-Fe2O3, and 
other oxide- b ased MNPs without the use of a stabilizing agent. Microwave heating 
provides a more homogeneous and shorter nucleation time than other conventional 
methods, making it a more innovative, efficient, cost- effective, and t ime- effective 
chemical method for the fabrication of MNPs.
The thermal decomposition technique is also could be used for producing MNPs. 
To produce NPs of preferred size and shape, organometallic precursors are decom￾posed in the existence of organic surfactants. Stabilizing agents such as fatty acids, 
hexadecyl amine, and oleic acid helps to control the growth of NPs during the deposi￾tion process and produce a particle with a desirable size. The thermal decomposition 
of Fe ( CO)5 results in the formation of iron NPs, which can then be oxidized to form 
high purity iron oxide NPs. The decomposition of the metal precursor Fe ( CO)5 with 
cationic metal centers can cause in the direct development of Fe3O4 NPs.
12.2.3 other Methods
Biological synthesis also could be used for synthesizing MNPs using living organ￾isms such as microorganisms ( bacteria, viruses, fungi, and actinomycetes) and 
plants. The advantage of this method is its eco friendliness, and cleanliness. The 
synthesis of NPs from various plant parts has piqued the interest of researchers. 
Biological synthesis mechanism of NP formation using microorganisms and plants 
is even now underneath research. A few studies suggested that potential mechanisms 
for the mycosynthesis of MNPs include nitrate reductase activity, shuttle electrons 
quinones, and a miscellaneous mechanism. But, the process is not clear enough to 
acknowledge to prepare MNPs. As a catalyst in the Suzuki– Miyaura reaction and 264 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials
photocatalysis, a biologically synthesized Fe3O4 was used [33]. Some shortcomings 
of this method, such as yield and dispersion of MNPs, need further investigation.
12.3 FUNCTIONALIZATION OF MAGNETIC NANOMATERIALS
The proportion of magnetic grains needed to hold a bit of data has decreased from 
1,000 to a few 100 in recent years due to improving data storage density, as well as 
a drop in grain size. Ferromagnetic NPs with uniform size and shape are important 
in the design and fabrication of self- assembled magnetic media including hard disks 
and magnetic tape. The particles’ single- d omain status is also critical for preventing 
undesirable magnetization reversal via domain wall motion [34]. However, strong 
magnetic anisotropy must be maintained to prevent thermal instability of magneti￾zation. Thus, functionalization of MNPs with organic, polymer, or inorganic mol￾ecules reduces particle aggregation, increases particle stability and uniformity, and 
aids in the formation of single- d omain particles and self- a ssembling of particles in 
magnetic media without interaction with neighboring particles. The list of magnetic 
nanoparticles functionalized with various molecules and the preparation methods are 
tabulated in Table 12.1.
High magnetic moment superparamagnetic NPs can be prepared in organic phase 
syntheses to achieve monodispersity in size, shape, and composition. They are typi￾cally stabilized by surfactants which are all hydrophobic. The w ater- soluble quan￾tum dots were originally created using the surfactant addition technique, which was

subsequently effectively proven for dispersing MNPs into aqueous solutions for bio￾medical purposes. However, reports on the use of organic- functionalized MNPs in 
magnetic data storage are uncommon. Nonetheless, some studies found a significant 
change in the magnetic behavior of MNPs that were functionalized with organic 
molecules. After coating of a PEG- m odified phospholipid micelle, high magnetic 
moment superparamagnetic FeCo NPs were reported [35]. Iron oxide NPs coated 
with polyacrylic acid demonstrated superparamagnetic behavior, with significant 
changes in Hc and residual magnetization as polyacrylic acid concentration was 
increased [36]. There was no Hc or remanence witnessed for Fe3O4, Fe3O4/silica, 
and Fe3O4/silica-NH2, indicating the superparamagnetic nature of materials with 
decreased Ms after silica modification on Fe3O4 [37]. Although amine functionaliza￾tion on the surface of Fe3O4 reduced the magnetization, as a basic catalyst it controls 
particle size and inhibits hydrolysis to form particles with regular morphology [38].
Pure ZnO is paramagnetic by default; however, doping it with Ni and Mn causes 
it to become ferromagnetic. Surface functionalization with different organic mole￾cules as thiol, amine, and trioctahedral phosphine oxide ( TOPO) molecules is antici￾pated to further improve this ferromagnetic property. Both u n- functionalized and 
functionalized Ni, Mn- ZnO exhibited a ferromagnetic characteristic ( Figure 12.4). 
Bound magnetron polarons ( BMP), which are created by the exchange interaction 
among oxygen vacancies and Mn ions, have been used to explain how oxygen vacan￾cies’ impact on ferromagnetism in Mn- ZnO films at different oxygen pressures. All 
ZnO: Mn film’s Ms increased after being functionalized with amine, however the 
 amine- functionalized 10 mol% ZnO: Mn film had the better Ms value of 2.1 emu/ cm3
( Figure 12.4a). The functional group features of N- added BMP model that resulted 
in the addition of N atom on the exterior of the Zn. The N atom stimulates the charge 
redistribution that leads to hybridization between 4s and 2p orbitals and resulted 
in the establishment of Zn– N and N– O bonds which enhanced the Ms [39]. The 
 M– H l oop of TOPO- functionalized Ni- Z nO films recorded at RT showed a ferro￾magnetic behavior for all the unfunctionalized and functionalized N i- ZnO films 
( Figure 12.4b). The Ms of Ni- ZnO films are 5.7, 10.1, and 8.6 emu/ cm3 for 3, 5, and

7 mol%, respectively. Higher Ms was observed for 5 mol% of Ni- Z nO. The occur￾rence of extra grain boundaries, which order ferromagnetic like behavior, favors fer￾romagnetic behavior as crystallite size decreases. Due to the exchange interaction 
among oxygen vacancies and Ni ions in the Ni- ZnO, the development of BMP is the 
cause of the ferromagnetism in the Ni- d oped films ( F igure 12.5b). In host matrix, 
the oxygen vacancies are coupled with Ni ions and form the isolated magnetic polar￾ons. The process of TOPO functionalization is schematically shown in Figure 12.5a. 
More polarons overlap as a result of more oxygen vacancies, which in turn mediates 
ferromagnetism.
Considering the T OPO- functionalized Ni- doped ZnO, the Ms was improved in 
all films but retains the same trend. The Ms values were measured as around 8, 12, 
and 10 emu/c m3 for 3, 5, and 7 mol%, respectively. The enhanced Ms is due to the 
formation of Zn– P and P– O b onds upon surface functionalization. Due to TOPO 
functionalization, the P atom sits on the exterior of the Zn. Due to the P atom’s lower 
electronegativity value (2 .19), when compared to the O atom, the charge redistribu￾tion is caused (3 .44). In this case, the ligands share the Zn site’s charge, causing a 
charge imbalance between the Zn– O bonds and lowering the Zn– O bond as a result. 
As a result, the Zn– O bond close to the P site extended, while the Zn– O bonds next 
to it significantly shrank. The system becomes more ferromagnetic because of varia￾tions in bond length and charge redistribution that result in additional holes on the 
p orbital. Therefore, instead of oxygen vacancies as in Ni- Z nO film, the augmenta￾tion of ferromagnetism in TOPO- m odified Ni- Z nO films could be caused by charge Functionalized Magnetic Nanomaterials for Data Storage Applications 267
distribution ( F igure 12.5c). Due to the hybridization of Zn- O - P o rbitals after TOPO 
functionalization, the Hc was then reduced for all films, but it still follows the same 
pattern as unfunctionalized films. For spintronic memory devices, the low Hc and 
high Ms are beneficial. Given this, the TOPO- functionalized 5 mol% Ni- ZnO has the 
lowest Hc ( 290 Oe) and highest Ms ( 11.51 emu/ cm3
) of all the films, making it suit￾able for usage in spintronic applications [40].
Functionalization of the same Ni- d oped ZnO films with thiol molecules improved 
the Ms to 6.9, 13.2, and 11.2 emu/ cm3 for 3, 5, and 7 mol% of Ni concentration, respec￾tively. This enhancement in magnetization can be attributed to thiol (“ S” ligands) 
adsorption on the surface of N i- Z nO films, which modifies the surface bonds of Z n- 
 4s and O- 2p states in conduction bands. Thiol molecules’ alteration of the surface 
bond triggers the ferromagnetic properties. Thus, thiol functionalization in N i- ZnO 
led to ferromagnetism as a result of modification in ZnO’s conduction band, which 
in turn led to the formation of surface layers linking sulfur- related bonds on the 
exterior. Specifically, after adsorption on the ZnO surface, S- 3 p states are coupled 
with O- 2p states and delocalized nearby the Fermi level. As a result, the delocaliza￾tions near the Fermi level and spin polarization of O- 2p states are caused by the spin 
polarized S- 3 p levels. Hence, the magnetism exists in only on the exterior, and thus 
the thiol atoms disturb the surface atomic layers [42]. Similar impact on the magne￾tization was witnessed in the case of thiol functionalization M n- ZnO, and for 10% 
Mn, a doped ZnO film, a maximum of 18% enhanced ferromagnetism was observed 
[41] (Figure 12.4c).
Surfactant and coupling agents were among the organic small molecules used to 
alter the exterior of Fe3O4 NPs, resulting in monodisperse w ell- d efined particles with 
less interparticle interaction. The water- soluble quantum dot manufacturing tech￾nique was initially devised, and subsequently it was successfully tested for dispersing 
magnetic NPs into aqueous mediums. Silane coupling agent is commonly used sur￾face alkylation modifying material such as 3- aminopropyltriethoxysilane ( APTS), ( 3- 
 aminopropyl) triethoxysilane ( APTES), and octyl triethoxysilane ( OTES). Due to the 
monodispersity in size and shape, superparamagnetic particles are made in organic 
phase synthesis. However, these SPM particles are normally stabilized by surfactants 
like oleic acid and/ or oleyl amine and are hydrophobic molecules. The Fe3O4 NPs 
were created using the coprecipitation method, and then they were dispersed into 
a homogenous solution containing 3-aminopropyltriethoxysi-lane (APTS) to create 
magnetic Fe3O4 NPs ( Fe3O4- APTS) modified by APTS [43]. Lee et al. coated SiO2
on the outer layer of Fe3O4 NPs with TEOS as a silicon source first, followed by 
adding (3-amino-propyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) and octyltriethoxysilane (OTES)
into the mixed solution, then the surface- m odified magnetic nano- a dsorbed material 
(Fe3O4@SiO2@APTES/ OTES) and the schematic preparation process is showed in 
 Figure 12.6a. The possible two types for the functionalization of NMPs with natural 
biopolymer are shown in Figure 12.6b. Likewise, Zhang et al. formed a layer of SiO2
on the outer layer of Fe3O4 NPs using sodium silicate as the silicon precursor in 
alkaline situations and then alkylated the exterior of Fe3O4@SiO2 by adding APTS, 
yielding Fe3O4@SiO2@APTS [44].
Wei et al. have functionalized the Fe3O4 NPs with borophene, which is a material 
with unique electronic structure, to develop h igh- p erformance rewritable memory

device. For this purpose, a metal–dielectric–insulator–metal (MDIM) arrangement 
was designated to form the memory device. The b orophene- functionalized Fe3O4
 core– shell NPs and poly ( vinyl pyrrolidone) ( PVP) were mixed by ethanol followed 
by ultra- sonication, where the core– shell NPs are the active layers and PVP are the 
insulators. Schematic illustration of fabrication of b orophene- functionalized Fe3O4
NPs and the structure of borophene shell is shown in F igure  12.7 a– c). The TEM 
micrograph of borophene-functionalized Fe3O4 NPs is shown in Figure 12.8( a). The 
schematic diagram of the developed memory device with b orophene- functionalized 
Fe3O4 NPs is shown in F igure 12.8b.
A set voltage of 0.57 V and high on/ off current ratio of 105 were measured from 
the I – V and retention time– current measurement, respectively. Its reset voltage of 
around 0.19 V is 20 folds lower than that of the MoS2- PVP device and the on/o ff cur￾rent ratio of 8.23 × 105 is over two orders of magnitude higher than the B QDs- P VP 
device (F igure 12.8c and d), implying that the b orophene- F e3O4 device has superior 
memory performance while consuming less power [46].
The foremost and easiest way for the modification of MNP is functionalization 
with inorganic small molecules such as SiO2, Al2O3, graphene, and carbon, on the 
surface of Fe2O3 NP [ 47– 50]. The chemical bonding interaction occurs on the inter￾face between Fe3O4 NPs exterior and inorganic materials, causing in high bonding 
strength. Chen et  al. demonstrated the activation of the exterior of Fe3O4 NPs in Functionalized Magnetic Nanomaterials for Data Storage Applications 269

HCl solution and then used TEOS as the silicon source, and MNPs ( Fe3O4@SiO2) 
coated with SiO2 were obtained at RT [51]. The a s-p repared Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs were 
redispersed into a homogeneous solution comprising CTAB and TEOS, and finally, 
the MNPs coated with a layer of mesoporous SiO2 (Fe3O4@SiO2@m-SiO2) were 
obtained [52]. Wei et al. [53] used a self- assembly process to prepare a core– shell 
magnetic Fe3O4/ GO and demonstrated good water dispersibility, high Ms, and sensi￾tive magnetic response.
The procedure for grafting inorganic small molecules on the exterior of MNPs is 
simple and straightforward. After surface functionalization, the structural stability 
and magnetic properties of magnetic nanomaterials are altered. The effect of sub￾strate and oxidation during annealing was reduced in DC magnetron sputtered FePt 
and CoPt films encapsulated with 200 Å layers of C as under layer and over layer. 
Small FePt NPs form in ca rbon- rich samples and exhibit superparamagnetic behav￾ior at RT. The Hc of FePt/C and CoPt/ C could be organized by tuning the bilayer 
thickness and annealing environments. The Hc develops significantly more slowly in 
films with higher C content because the matrix material restricts the expansion of the 
particle size. CoPt/ C developed with 700°C showed a Ms of around 750 emu/ cc and 
an anisotropy constant (K u) of around 9 × 106 ergs/c c at RT. At low temperature, the 
Hc increased from 5,500 to 9,200 Oe and Ms and Ku improved to 779 emu/c c and 
1.2 × 107 ergs/ cc respectively, which are nearer to the theoretical value of bulk CoPt 
[9]. Strong exchange contacts ( M positive) between particles were seen in films with 
little carbon content, and this led to a more squared hysteresis loop. The exchange 270 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

contact between particles reduces as carbon content rises. The interaction between 
the particles is primarily dipolar (M n egative) and a more slanted loop is seen when 
the carbon concentration is significantly higher than CoPt with a component ratio of 
roughly 6:9 showed M close to zero as a consequence of balancing among exchange 
and dipolar interactions. Given that the materials exhibited fairly squared loops while 
preserving particle isolation, it may be the best for magnetic recording applications. 
This results in a higher signal- to- n oise ratio in the recording film. Strong exchange 
contacts (δMpositive) between particles were seen in films with little carbon content, 
and this led to a more squared hysteresis loop. The exchange contact between par￾ticles reduces as carbon content rises. The interaction between the nanoparticles is 
primarily dipolar (δMnegative) and a more slanted loop is seen when the carbon con￾centration is significantly higher than CoPt. Films with a component ratio of roughly 
6:9 showed δM close to zero as a consequence of balancing among exchange and 
dipolar interactions. Given that the materials exhibited fairly squared loops while 
preserving particle isolation, it may be the best for magnetic recording applications. 
This results in a higher signal- to-n oise ratio in the recording film.

stop the coalescence of the NPs. The thermal treatment of FePt NPs at 600°C for 2 h 
in reducing environment leads to phase transition from fcc to fct- L10 and most of the 
FePt NPs have converted to fct- L10 after 700 ºC annealing. During functionalization 
processes, many active sites on CNTs are formed, which are useful for nucleation 
and FePt NPs growth ( F igure 12.9a and b). The reaction between the surfaces of the 
NPs and the CNTs produces fixed size FePt NPs with a typical size of around 3.5 nm 
which are annealed at 600 ºC and the higher Hc of 5.1 kOe was observed for the 
samples annealed at 700 ºC ( Figure 12.9c) [54].
Magnetic storage media require ferro/ ferri MNPs that act as individual magnets 
at room temperature. Magnetically induced particle aggregation and interparticle 
attractive force impede solution- b ased synthesis of stabilized s elf-a ssembled ferro￾magnetic NPs. Polymer functionalization of ferromagnetic NPs allows the particles 
to s elf- assemble and avoids the magnetically induced aggregation that is commonly 
associated with ferromagnetic NPs.
Pyun et al. synthesized the p olystyrene- coated Co NPs with end groups that inter￾act with the growing ferromagnetic Co NP exterior, acting as a steric buffer among 
the particles and reducing interparticle magnetic interactions [55]. Similarly, mono￾disperse 4 nm FePt NPs coated with a layer of polyethylenimine ( PEI) and thermal 
treatment converts the fcc to fct structure, in which superparamagnetic thin FePt NPs 
assemblies change to ferromagnetic [56]. The TEM micrograph of polystyerene/c obalt 
and PEI- mediated FePt MNPs are showed in F igure 10a, b, d, and e. To form c ore– 
s hell composites, the oleic acid surfactants were replaced with poly (a crylic acid)- 
b-poly(styrene) (PAA-b-PS) diblock copolymers to improve the solution stability of 
the CoFe2O4 NPs. The schematic process of s elf- a ssembled functionalized MNPs in 
thin film form and the physical re orientation to have a same alignment direction is 
shown in F igure 12.11a. When compared to oleic a cid- stabilized CoFe2O4 NPs, the 
interparticle spacing for the core–s hell complex was increased ( F igure 12.11b and c).
The magnetic behavior of CoFe2O4 NPs with a size of 18 nm remains ferrimag￾netic after polymer coating, indicating that changing the surface ligands has little 
effect on the magnetic properties. When polymer modified MNPs were placed onto 272 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

12.4 SUMMARY AND SCOPE
The first commercial HDD used aluminum disks coated with γ-Fe2O3 magnetic par￾ticles and polymer binder to locate a single record in an average time of 600 ms. It 274 Nanostructured Magnetic Materials

could store 5 MB of data at a density of 2 kbits/i n2 and required a 9 × 15 m room to 
be placed in. The disk size has continued to shrink, with a doubling of areal density 
every 18 months, a phenomenon known in the semiconductor industry as Moore’s 
law. Every 18 months, the cost per MB of storage has decreased by a factor of two. 
In 2018, the disk diameters were 2.5 and 3.5 in., and the number of disks ranged 
from one to a few. The recording areal density was several TB/ in2 with a single 
2.5 in. diameter disk in 1 TB portable disk storage. The advancement of magnetic 
reading/w riting heads has contributed to the advancement of hard disk drive areal 
density. The progressive reduction in the length and thickness of the write/ read head 
sensor resulted in higher areal density and, consequently, higher HDD capacity. This 
progress has continued for the past 3 decades and will continue in the future in the 
motivation of high- density data storage that will meet future needs in massive data 
storage.
To meet increased storage demand in the upcoming years, the industry would 
need to increase NAND flash memory production as well as hard disk drive capacity. 
Modern HDDs with perpendicular magnetic recording (P MR) and shingled mag￾netic recording (S MR) platters have an area density of about 0.95 Terabit per square 
inch (Tb/in2
) and can store up to 10 TB of data (o n seven 1.43 TB platters). Two- 
 dimensional magnetic recording ( TDMR) technology has the potential to increase 
the areal density of HDD disks by 5% to 10%, which is a significant enhancement. 
Furthermore, Showa Denko K.K. ( SDK), the world’s largest independent hard drive 
platter manufacturer, has announced plans to begin mass production of n inth- 
 generation PMR HDD media with areal density of up to 1.3Tb/ in2 in the upcom￾ing years. H eat- assisted magnetic recording (H AMR) technology has the potential 
to significantly increase HDD capacity in the upcoming years. Unfortunately, mass 
production of actual hard drives featuring HAMR has been delayed for several years 
already and now it turns out that the first HAMR-b ased HDDs are in due. MAMR, 
or microwave-a ssisted magnetic recording, asserts several benefits, the majority Functionalized Magnetic Nanomaterials for Data Storage Applications 275
of which are related to that all- important storage metric— reliability [58]. MAMR 
drives are expected to hit the market in early 2023.
MAMR could theoretically reduce the magnetic field required for magnetization 
reversal by one-t hird [59], whereas HAMR could theoretically reduce the magnetic 
field required for recording almost to zero by heating a recording medium to the 
Curie point. HAMR is a promising e nergy-a ssisted magnetic recording technol￾ogy that has the potential to solve the trilemma associated with increasing HDD 
recording density. Toshiba is currently working on the commercialization of 3.5 -i nch 
nearline HDDs with MAMR read/ write heads and media. To increase the recording 
density even further, the size and magnetic anisotropy Ku of magnetic grains on 
recording media must be reduced. Recently, the HDD industry has considered using 
an iron–p latinum (F ePt) ordered alloy that provides Ku several times to several tens 
of times higher than the currently used Co- C r- Pt alloy [60]. According to Seagate 
and the ASTC, HAMR will result in HDD capacities approaching 50TB “ early next 
decade” and combining HAMR with b it- p atterned media to build he ated- d ot mag￾netic recording ( HDMR) drives will allow us to reach the 100TB HDD milestone.
