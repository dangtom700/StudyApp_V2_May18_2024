Multi-Objective 
Optimization System 
Designs and Their 
Applications 
This book introduces multi-objective design methods to solve multi-objective 
optimization problems (MOPs) of linear/nonlinear dynamic systems under intrinsic 
random fuctuation and external disturbance. The MOPs of multiple targets for systems 
are all transformed into equivalent linear matrix inequality (LMI)-constrained MOPs. 
Corresponding reverse-order LMI-constrained multi-objective evolution algorithms 
are introduced to solve LMI-constrained MOPs using MATLAB®. All proposed 
design methods are based on rigorous theoretical results, and their applications are 
focused on more practical engineering design examples. 
Features: 
• Discusses multi-objective optimization from an engineer’s perspective. 
• Contains the theoretical design methods of multi-objective optimization 
schemes. 
• Includes a wide spectrum of recent research topics in control design, especially 
for stochastic mean feld diffusion problems. 
• Covers practical applications in each chapter, like missile guidance design, 
economic and fnancial systems, power control tracking, minimization design 
in communication, and so forth. 
• Explores practical multi-objective optimization design examples in control, 
signal processing, communication, and cyber-fnancial systems. 
This book is aimed at researchers and graduate students in electrical engineering, 
control design, and optimization. Multi-Objective

Preface 
People always pursue multiple objectives in life. For Chinese-speaking people, the 
fve blessings—longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue, and natural death—are 
always the fve traditional targets to search for in life. These blessings always appear 
as couplets pasted on doors or doorposts during the lunar new year. Although most 
existing studies capture characteristics of system engineering designs in the form 
of single-objective problems (SOPs), multiple objectives arise naturally in real-life 
scenarios. These objectives confict with each other normally; in other words, these 
objectives cannot be optimized simultaneously. 
Even mathematicians and engineers could solve the optimal design problems of 
SOPs for a long time. But it is not easy to solve multi-objective optimization prob￾lems (MOPs) when the objectives are somewhat conficting. MOPs had been inher￾ent in mathematicians and engineers for a long time until Pareto used domination to 
defne the minimization of multi-objective vector in MOPs and consequently devel￾oped some theoretical results of MOP. In the last decades, the development of multi￾objective evolution algorithms (MOEAs) has signifcantly improved the effciency of 
solving MOPs. Then control engineers combined MOEA methods and linear matrix 
inequality (LMI) techniques, that is, so-called LMI-constrained MOEAs, to solve 
LMI-constrained MOPs of multi-objective controls and flter design problems of lin￾ear stochastic systems via the help of MOEAs and the LMI toolbox in MATLAB. 
In general, it is still very diffcult to solve MOPs of nonlinear systems because 
it is necessary to solve a highly nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI)–MOP. 
Recently several interpolation methods like the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy method, global 
linearization scheme, and gain schedule method have been proposed to interpolate 
several local linearized systems to effciently approximate a nonlinear system. With 
these interpolation methods, HJI-constrained MOPs for the multi-objective design 
of nonlinear stochastic systems can be transformed into equivalent LMI-constrained 
MOPs and therefore can be effciently solved with the help of MOEAs and the LMI 
toolbox in MATLAB with more practical applications. 
This book is divided into four parts. In the frst part of this book, the concepts 
and general theories of MOPs will be introduced. The applications of MOPs to the 
multi-objective designs of control systems are given in the second part. In the third 
part of this book, I will introduce multi-objective optimal design problems in sig￾nal processing and communication systems. Finally, in the fourth part of this book, 
multi-objective optimization design problems in cyber-social systems will be intro￾duced to meet the recent rapid development of MOPs in cyber-social or fnancial 
systems via a smart wireless network in the future 5G or 6G era. 
Last but not least, I would like to thank Dr. Gagandeep Singh, an editor at CRC, 
who has given me a lot of help during the course of this project. The author is also 
grateful to Ms. Ci-Jun Wang for her careful typing of this book. xv

Introduction to 1 Multi-Objective 
Optimization Problems 
1.1 INTRODUCTION 
In this chapter, a more general multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) under non￾linear inequality constraints is introduced for algebraic systems. In general, it is very dif￾fcult to solve a nonlinear inequality-constrained MOP. Based on the linearization scheme 
at some operation points, the nonlinear inequality-constrained MOP can be transformed 
into a solvable linear matrix inequality (LMI)–constrained MOP. Since the number of 
design parameters of MOPs in control and signal processing design of nonlinear stochas￾tic systems is always much larger than the number of multi-objectives, the conventional 
multi-objective evolution algorithms (MOEAs), which always update the design param￾eters by evolution algorithm to search for the optimal multi-objectives, are not suitable 
for practical designs of MOPs in the feld of control and signal processing even if they 
have excellent results in some simple design examples of MOP. In this chapter, a reverse￾order LMI-constrained MOEA is proposed to directly update the multi-objective vector 
of an MOP for an algebraic system frst and then to search for the multi-objective optimal 
design parameters of an MOP indirectly with the help of powerful convex search algo￾rithm from the LMI toolbox in MATLAB. If we become familiar with the design proce￾dure of nonlinear inequality-constrained MOPs of algebraic systems in this chapter, it will 
be easier to solve the MOPs of nonlinear stochastic systems in the following chapters. 
Recently, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model, global linearization scheme, 
and gain scheduling method have been utilized to interpolate several local linearized 
systems to approximate nonlinear stochastic systems. With these interpolation meth￾ods, the MOPs of control and flter design in nonlinear stochastic systems can be 
transformed into LMI-constrained MOPs. Therefore, based on the reverse-order 
MOEA in this chapter, the MOPs of control and signal processing in nonlinear sto￾chastic systems can be easily solved by the proposed reverse-order LMI-constrained 
MOEA method in the following chapters. 
1.2 MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION 
PROBLEMS IN ALGEBRAIC SYSTEMS 
Let us consider the following general MOP of an algebraic system with the objective 
functions min( fx ( ), , ˜ f x( ),, ˜ f x( )) within a feasible convex region W [1–3] 1 i N xÎW 
min( fx ( ), , ˜ f x( ),, ˜ fx ( )) (1.1) 1 i N xÎW  
 
4 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
subject to the following nonlinear inequality constraints: 
g x() £ 0,i = 1,..., J (1.2) i 
h x() = 0,k = 1,..., K (1.3) k 
where x = ( , x x ..., ,..., x ) Î ° T n are design parameters, all the objective functions 1 i n 
f x( ),i = 1,..., N are convex, all inequality constrained functions g x( ),i = 1,..., J are i i 
convex, and all equality functions h x( ), k = 1,..., K are linear in W. k n m Remark 1.1: The design parameter x could be a vector or matrix, that is, x Î ˜ ´ . 
In general it is not easy to solve the MOP in (1.1)–(1.3) directly [4, 5]. It is appeal￾ing to solve the MOP in (1.1)–(1.3) indirectly by minimizing the upper bounds via 
the following MOP 
min( a , , ˜ a , , ˜ a ) (1.4) 1 i N xÎW 
subject to f x £ ai i() ,i = 1 ,..., N (1.5) 
g x() £ 0,i = 1,..., J (1.6) i 
h x k () = 0,k = 1,..., K (1.7) 
where ai denotes the upper bound of f x() for i = 1,..., N and W denotes the feasible i 
set of x. 
Before further the discussion of MOP in (1.4)–(1.7), we have to introduce the fol￾lowing defnitions of Pareto optimal solutions of the previous MOP [1–4]. 
Definition 1.1 (Pareto Dominance [1, 2]): Let x1 Î W and x2 Î W be 
the feasible solution of the MOP in (1.4)–(1.7) corresponding to the 1 1 1 2 2 2 objective values ( , a ...,a ,...,a ) and ( , a ...,a ,...,a ) N , respectively. 1 i N 1 i 
1 1 1 2 2 2 The solution ( , a ...,a ,...,a ) is said to dominate ( , a ...,a ,...,a ) if 1 i N 1 i N

inequality. 
Defnition 1.2 (Pareto Optimality [1, 2]): A solution x * Î W with the set of * * * objective values ( , a1 ...,ai ,...,a N ) is said to be a Pareto optimal solution if 
and only if there does not exist another feasible solution that dominates it; 
that is, we use domination to defne the “simultaneous minimization” in the 
MOP in (1.4)–(1.7). 
Defnition 1.3 (Pareto Optimal Solution Set [1, 2]): For the given MOP 
in (1.4)–(1.7), in general, the Pareto optimal solution is not unique. There 
exists a set of Pareto optimal solutions. The Pareto optimal solution set r* 
is defned as follows:

Defnition 1.4 (Pareto Front [1, 2]): For the given MOP in (1.4)–(1.7), the 
Pareto front Fp is defned as follows:

After the introduction of the previous defnitions, we will prove that the solutions 
of the MOP in (1.4)–(1.7) are also the solutions of the MOP in (1.1)–(1.3). In this sit￾uation, the MOPs in (1.1)–(1.3) can be solved by the equivalent MOP in (1.4)–(1.7) 
indirectly. 
Theorem 1.1: The MOPs in (1.4)–(1.7) are equivalent to the MOP in (1.1)–(1.3). 
Proof: The proof is simple. If we can prove that all the inequalities in (1.5) and * * * (1.6) become equalities when the optimization objective vector ( , a1 ...,ai ,...,a N ) is 
achieved. It will be proved by contradiction. Suppose the inequality constraints in 
(1.5) are strictly held for a Pareto optimal solution; that is, there exists a Pareto * * * * * optimal solution ( , a a ..., ,...,a ) with f x() < a , for some i. As a result, we have 1 i N i i * 1 * * * * * 1 * f x() = a < a . In this situation ( , a a ..., ,...,a )is dominated by ( , a a ..., ,...,a N ). i i i 1 i N 1 i * * * This will contradict the fact that the Pareto optimal solution (, a a ...,a , ..., ) cannot 1 i N 
be dominated by another solution in Defnition 1.2. 
1.3 REVERSE-ORDER LMI-CONSTRAINED MOEAS FOR MOPs 
Based on Theorem 1.1, the MOP in (1.1)–(1.3) is equivalent to the equivalent MOP 
in (1.4)–(1.7). However, it is very diffcult to solve the MOP in (1.4) under nonlinear 
constraints (1.5)–(1.7). In this situation, interpolation methods like the T-S fuzzy 
interpolation method [6–8], global linearization method [9], and gain scheduling 
method [10] can be employed to simplify the MOP in (1.4) under the nonlinear ine￾quality constraints in (1.5)–(1.7). In this book, the LMI-constrained MOEA will be 
employed to solve MOPs of nonlinear stochastic systems. Therefore, before using 
the proposed algorithm, the nonlinear constraints should be linearized in some local 
regions. In the following, some linearized constraints are used to approximate the 
nonlinear constraints in (1.5)–(1.7) in some local regions to simplify the MOP in 
(1.4)–(1.7). This leads to the following local linearizations of nonlinear constraints 
in different local regions [9]

Based on the linearized constraints in L local regions in (1.10), the MOP in (1.4)– 
(1.7) can be simplifed to the following MOP with linearized constraints in L local 
regions around the operation points x l, = 1,..., L. l

h x( ) in (1.5)–(1.7), respectively, which are globally linear and don’t need the line- k 
arization in (1.10) at local regions. 
Remark 1.2: The nonlinear constraints (1.5)–(1.7) of MOP in (1.4) are replaced 
by L linearized constraints at L x L local regions around the operation points {} . The l l=1 
linear-constrained MOP in (1.11)–(1.14) can be represented by an LMI-constrained 
MOP as follows:

T T c + (C + C x) = 0,k = 1,..., K (1.18) k0 k0 kl 
l = 1,..., L 
After the MOP in (1.4) under nonlinear constraints (1.5)–(1.7) is simplifed to the 
MOP in (1.11) with linear constraints in (1.12)–(1.14) or LMI-constrained MOP in 
(1.15)–(1.18), the MOEA will be employed to treat the MOP in (1.11) or (1.15). In 
general, the conventional MOEAs update the design parameters { }n x by an evolu- i i=1 
tion algorithm (EA) to search the multi-objective vector ( , a a ...,a ,..., ) in (1.11) or 1 i N * * * (1.15) for the Pareto optimal solutions ( , a a ...,a ,..., ) via the nondominated sorting 1 i N 
and crowd tournament selection schemes in the parametric space [1–3]. In general, 
the number n of design parameters x = [ , x ..., 1 xn ]
T is always much larger than the Introduction to Multi-Objective Optimization Problems 7 
number N of the multi-objective vectors ( , a ...,a ,...,a ) in (1.11) in practical appli- 1 i N 
cations. Especially in the following chapters, the design parameters include fuzzy 
controller parameters and observer parameters of complex fuzzy systems with a large 
number of local controllers and observers. It is almost impossible to employ EA 
for updating these fuzzy controller and observer parameters to achieve an MOP of 
complex T-S fuzzy systems, such as the multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy observer-based 
nonlinear stochastic systems in Chapter 3. Further, for conventional MOEAs, the 
corresponding objective vector of a child population randomly generated by crosso￾ver and mutation operations may exceed the real Pareto front Fp if the current popula￾tion is close to the real Pareto optimality. Clearly, if the generated child population is 
infeasible, it will be directly discarded. In this situation, it is very diffcult to generate 
a feasible child population while the current population is close to the real Pareto 
optimality [3, 4]. This is why the conventional MOEAs have not been addressed on 
the MOP of control or flter design in nonlinear dynamic systems based on the T-S 
fuzzy model method and global linearization method, even they are very powerful in 
MOPs of other more simple designed systems. 
In this book, a reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA is proposed to solve the 
MOP in (1.11)–(1.14) or LMI-constrained MOP in (1.15)–(1.18) and the LMI-con￾strained MOPs in the following chapters. First, instead of updating the design 
parameters in x = x x ,..., x )
T Î °n ( ,..., by EA to search the multi-objective vec- 1 i n * * * tor ( , a ...,a ,...,a ) for the Pareto optimal solutions ( , a ...,a ,...,a ), we update 1 i N 1 i N 
the multi-objective vector ( , a a ...,a ,..., ) by EA to search for the Pareto optimal 1 i N * * * solutions ( , a a ...,a ,..., ) directly and then fnd the corresponding feasible solu- 1 i N * n tions { } x of design parameters indirectly by solving the LMIs in (1.12)–(1.14) i i=1 
with the help of the LMI toolbox in MATLAB. The proposed reverse-order LMI￾based MOEA can also avoid the previously mentioned shortage of exceeding the real 
Pareto front Fp if the current population is close to the real Pareto optimality due to 
child populations randomly generated by crossover and mutation operations. In the 
proposed reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA, if there exists a child population 
( , a˝ ...,a˝ ,...,a˝ ) that is not feasible for the LMI constraints in (1.12)–(1.14), then a 1 i N 
population ( , a ...,a ,...,a ) from the parent set that is closest to ( , a˝ ...,a˝ ,...,a˝ ) is 1 i N 1 i N 
selected, and the child population is replaced by 1 (a a˝ ,...,a a+ ˝ ,...,a +a˝N + ). 2 1 1 i i N 
The mechanism will be repeated until the fxed child population is feasible for the 
linear constraints in (1.12)–(1.14). 
Based on these analyses, the reverse-order MOEA is proposed for the MOP in 
(1.11)–(1.14): 
Step 1: Choose the search region R = [ , a a ]´˜´[a , ] a ´˜´[a ,a ] 1 1 i i N N 
of the multi-objective vector ( , a a ...,a ,..., ) and the feasible region 1 i N

. Give the 1 1 i i n n i i= 
population number Np, iteration number Ni
, crossover rate Cr, and mutation 
rate cm of the EA in the proposed reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA. 
Set iteration index j = 1.

Step 3: Employ crossover and mutation operators for the parent set Pj and parent

is not feasible for the linear constraints in (1.12)–(1.14), then a population 
( , a ...,a ,...,a ) from the parent set that is closest to ( , a ˝ ˜,a ˝ ) is selected, 1 i N 1 N 
j and the child population Pchild is feasible for the linear constraints in (1.12)–

1.4 SIMULATION EXAMPLE 
After the reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA is proposed for solving the MOP 
under a class of linear inequality constraints, with some modifcation, the proposed 
algorithm can be used to solve nonlinear constrained MOPs of algebraic systems. In 
the following, an MOP of the Zitzler-Debi test function in [5] is given to illustrate the 
design procedure and then validate the performance of the proposed reverse-order 
LMI-constrained MOEA. Consider the following test problem [5] 
min( 1 ( ), ( 2 f x fx )) (1.19)

the nonlinear inequality–constrained MOP in (1.4)–(1.7). For simplicity, the 
linearized constraint in (1.28) is obtained with only one operation point at

Based on the reverse-order MOEA, setting the population number Nr = 80, the 
iteration number N = 120, crossover rate C = 0 8. , and mutation rate C = 0 2. in i r m 
the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA, the Pareto front of the MOP in (1.25)–(1.28) 
is shown in Figure 1.1. Compared with the Pareto front in [5], due to only one local 
linearization, the Pareto front obtained by the proposed reverse-order MOEA is sim￾ilar but with a more linear curvature. However, it can be seen that the Pareto opti￾mal solutions are uniformly distributed on the Pareto form under the nondominating 
sorting and crowding comparison. In general, the results can be further improved by 
increasing the number of operation points for the local linearization of nonlinear con￾straints as shown in (1.10), that is, with more linear inequality constraints as shown 
in (1.12)–(1.14) based on the more local linearizations at more operation points. 
More sophisticated design examples of MOPs of nonlinear systems will be given in 
the following chapters.

1.5 CONCLUSION 
In this chapter, a more general MOP of algebraic systems under nonlinear inequality 
constraints is introduced frst. With the help of local linearized techniques in different 
local regions, the nonlinear inequality–constrained MOP can be transformed into an 
MOP under a set of LMI constraints. A reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA is 
also proposed to effciently solve the LMI-constrained MOP. Recently, MOP designs 
[6–10] of nonlinear stochastic systems in the feld of control and signal processing 
have been more appealing. Several interpolation methods have been utilized to inter￾polate several local linearized systems to approximate a nonlinear system, such as 
the fuzzy interpolation method [6, 8], globate linearization method [9], gain schedul￾ing method [10], and so on. Based on these local linearization methods, the proposed 
reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA can be further extended to solve dynamic 
system-constrained MOPs of control and flter design of nonlinear stochastic sys￾tems in the following chapters. 12 DOI: 10.1201/9781003362142-3 
 
 
Multi-Objective 2 Optimization Design 
for Linear and Nonlinear 
Stochastic Systems 
2.1 INTRODUCTION 
After the introduction of MOPs under algebraic inequality constraints [1, 2] in Chap￾ter 1, for more practical applications [6, 7, 9, 11–18], MOPs of the stabilization 
control of linear and nonlinear stochastic systems will be introduced in this chap￾ter. Some fundamental properties of MOPs of multi-objective stabilization control 
strategies of stochastic systems are introduced frst. For the convenient illustration 
of MOPs of multi-objective stabilization control design in linear stochastic systems, 
the MOPs of multi-objective H2/H∞ stabilization control design of linear stochastic 
systems are introduced as a design example. MOPs of multi-objective H2/H∞ stabi￾lization control design problems can be transformed into linear matrix inequality– 
constrained MOPs. A reverse-order MOEA in [13] is also introduced to effciently 
solve LMI-constrained MOPs for the multi-objective H2/H stabilization control ∞ 
design of linear stochastic systems. 
MOPs of multi-objective H2/H∞ stabilization on control of nonlinear stochastic
systems need to solve a Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI)–constrained MOP. At 
present, there exists no analytical method to effciently solve HJIs. Based on the 
global linearization technique [9, 19], a nonlinear stochastic system can be approx￾imated by an interpolated system consisting of several local linearized stochastic 
systems through some interpolation functions. Then the HJI-constrained MOP of the 
multi-objective nonlinear stochastic stabilization control system can be transformed 
into an LMI-constrained MOP, which can be also solved by a reverse-order LMI￾constrained MOEA [2, 13], with some modifcations. These results are useful for the 
development of MOPs of control and flter designs for linear and nonlinear stochastic 
systems in the following chapters.

Consider the following linear stochastic jump-diffusion system.

Multi-Objective Optimization Design for Stochastic Systems 13 
n m n where x t() Î ˜ denotes the state vector; u t() Î ˜ denotes control input; v t() Î ˜ 
denotes the external disturbance; w t() Î ˜ denotes the standard Wiener process with 
zero mean and unit variance; and p t() Î ˜ denotes the Poisson counting process nn n m with Ep() t = lt, where l denotes the Poisson jump intensity. AÎ ˜ ´ , BÎ ˜ ´ , nn n n C Î ˜ ´ , and D Î ˜ ´ are system matrices. 
Remark 2.1: Consider the following linear dynamic system with intrinsic random 
fuctuation and external disturbance 
d 
x t() = (A C+ nt ( ) + Dq(t x )) () t + Bu t() + v t( ) dt (2.2) 
x( ) 0 = x0 
where n t() Î ˜ and q t() Î ˜ are white noise and Poisson process, respectively. Cn() t
and Dq( )t denote the continuous intrinsic random fuctuation and the discontinu￾ous intrinsic random fuctuation of system matrix A, respectively. By the fact that 
dw t () () = n t dt and dp t() = q( )t dt, then the linear dynamic system with intrinsic fuc￾tuation and external disturbance in (2.2) can be represented by the linear stochastic 
jump-diffusion system in (2.1). 
Some important properties of the Wiener process w t( ) and Poisson counting pro￾cess p t( ) are given as follows [11]: 
() i E{ ( wt )} = 0 ( ) ii Ed { ( w t)} = 0 
( )i E{ d w t 2 ii ( )} = d i t ( ) v E{ ( dp t )} = ldt (2.3)
( ) v E{ ( dp t d) ( wt )} = 0 ( ) vi E d{ ( p t)} dt = 0 
For the linear stochastic jump-diffusion system in (2.1), the multi-objective optimi￾zation problem for the control design is formulated as follows: 
min( J u(( t )),..., J (( ut )),..., J u(( t))) 1 i N u t( )ÎU (2.4) 
subject to (2.1) 
where U denotes the feasible solution set of u t( ). 
It is not easy to solve the MOP in (2.4) directly. The following suboptimal method 
is employed to solve it indirectly. 
* * * ( , a ...,a ,...,a ) = min( , a ...,a ,...,a ) (2.5) 1 i N 1 i N u t( )ÎU 
subject to (2.1) and J u t £ a ,i (2.6) i( ( )) i = 1,..., N 
Before the solution of the MOP in (2.5) and (2.6), some properties of the MOP in 
(2.5) are given in the following remark. 
Remark 2.2: Some properties of the MOP in (2.5) are given as follows [1]: 
(1) Pareto dominance: For the MOP in (2.5), suppose there exist two multi￾objective feasible solutions u t( ) and u t( ) with the corresponding objective 1 2  
 
14 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
1 1 1 2 2 2 values ( , a ...,a ,...,a ) and ( , a ...,a ,...,a ), respectively. The solution 1 i N 1 i N 
1 2 1 2 1 2 u t( ) is said to dominate u t( ) if a £ a ,...,a £ a ,...,a £ a and at 1 2 1 1 i i N N 
least one of the inequalities is a strict inequality. 
(2) Pareto optimality: The feasible solution ut * ( ) with the corresponding * * * objective values ( , a a ...,a ,..., ) of the MOP in (2.5) is said to be of 1 i N 
Pareto optimality with respect to the feasible solution set U if and only if 
there does not exist another feasible solution that dominates it. 
Based on the properties of the MOP in (2.5) in Remark 2.2, we get the following 
result. 
Theorem 2.1: The suboptimal solution of the MOP in (2.5) for linear stochastic 
jump-diffusion system in (2.1) is equivalent to the optimal solution of the MOP 
in (2.4). 
Proof: If we can prove that all inequalities in (2.6) will approach equalities when 
the solution of the MOP in (2.5) and (2.6) is achieved, then the theorem is true. 
It could be proved by contradiction. If the equalities in (2.6) are violated, then * * the solution of the MOP is achieved, that is, J u( (t )) = a ¢ <a for any i . In this i i i * * * * * solution, ( ,...,a¢,...,a ) will dominate ( ,...,a ,...,a N a a ). According to the Pareto 1 i N 1 i * * * optimality of the MOP, it will violate that ( , a a ...,a ,..., ) is the Pareto optimal 1 i N 
solution. Therefore, when the solution of the MOP in (2.5)–(2.6) is achieved, * * J u( (t)) = a . i i 
Based on Theorem 2.1, the MOP in (2.4) is equivalent to the MOP in (2.5)–(2.6). 
For the simplicity of illustration of the MOP in (2.4), the multi-objective H2/H∞ con￾trol strategy for linear stochastic jump-diffusion systems in (2.1) is considered a 
design example of the MOP in (2.4). Let us denote 
ò T T J u t = E ¥ 
( ( )) ( ( x t) ( Q x t ) + u ( t R)( ut )) dt (2.7) 2 1 0 
ò T T T E ¥ 
( ( x t Q) x t + ( ) ( )) tx 0 Px( ) 2 ( ) u t Ru t d - () 0 
J u( (t)) = 0 (2.8) ¥ ò

E vT ( )t v(t d) t 0 
Remark 2.2: The H2 control performance in (2.7) is the mean linear quadratic 
control performance without considering the external disturbance v t() ; that is, in the 
H2 optimal control design, we always assume v t() = 0 because the H2 optimal con￾trol cannot treat the corruption problem of external disturbance. The H∞ performance 
is the effect of external disturbance on the quadratic control performance from the 
energy perspective. The term xT ( ) 0 Px( ) 0 in the numerator of (2.8) is to extract the 
effect of initial x( ) 0 on the H∞ control performance. 
Then the multi-objective H2/H∞ control design problem is equivalent to the fol￾lowing MOP

Based on Theorem 2.1, the MOP of the H2/H∞ control strategy in (2.9) is equivalent 
to the following MOP

Before we solve the MOP of the H2/H∞ control strategy for the linear stochastic jump 
diffusion system in (2.1), the Itô-Lévy formula of a linear stochastic jump diffu￾sion system is given for the Lyapunov function V x( (t ))ÎC2
( , 0 ¥) with V( ) 0 = 0 and 
V x( (t )) > 0 as follows [7, 11]:

Remark 2.3: Since the Wiener process w t( ) is continuous but not differential 
and the Poisson process p t( ) is jumping and discontinuous in (2.1), the Itô term 1 T T 
2 x t() C Vxx ( ) x Cx t( ) is due to the differential result by the Itô derivative, and the 
Lévy term [( V x() t + Dxt ( )) -V x( ( t d ))] p is due to the derivative by the change of
energy via these jumps in the Poisson process. 
Based on the Itô-Lévy formula and with the Lyapunov function V x( (t )) = xT ( )t Px t() 
for a positive symmetric matrix P > 0, then we get the following result. 
Theorem 2.2: The MOP of the H2/H∞ control strategy in (2.10)–(2.11) can be 
solved by the following optimal H2/H∞ control and the worst-case external disturbance 
* -1 T * u t() = -R B P x() t (2.14) 
* 1 * v t() = P x() t (2.15) a ¥

Since (2.17) and (2.19) are Riccati-like inequalities, it is still not easy to solve the 
Riccati-like constrained MOP (2.16)–(2.19). Let us denote WP 1 = and multiply W -

Therefore, the MOP in (2.16)–(2.19) of the multi-objective H2/H∞ control design in 
(2.10)–(2.12) can be transformed into the following LMI-constrained MOP, 
min(a a, ) (2.25) 2 ¥ W >0

subject to LMIs in (2.22) - (2.24) (2.26) 
* After solving the LMI-constrained MOP in (2.25)–(2.26), we get the optimal W > 0, 
let P* = (W*

* -1 T * u t() = -R B P x() t (2.27) 
for the linear stochastic jump-diffusion system in (2.1). 
According to the analyses in Chapter 1, the reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA 
to solve the MOP in (2.25)–(2.26) of the H2/H∞ control design of the linear stochastic 
jump diffusion system in (2.1) is proposed as follows: 
The reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA for the MOP in (2.25)–(2.26) for the multi￾objective H2/H∞ control design of the linear stochastic jump diffusion system in (2.1). 
Step 1: Select the search region [ , a a ] [ ´ b , ] b for the feasible objective 2 ¥ 2 ¥
vector ( , 2 ¥ and set the iteration number Ni p a a ) , the population number N ,
the crossover rate Cr, and mutation ratio mr in the LMI-constrained MOEA. 
Set iteration number i = 1. 
Step 2: Select Np feasible individuals (chromosomes) from the feasible chro￾mosome set randomly to be the initial population P1. 
Step 3: Operate the EA with crossover rate Cr
 and mutation ratio mr , and generate 
2Np feasible chromosomes by examining whether their corresponding objec￾tive vectors ( , 2 ¥ a a )are feasible objective vectors for the LMIs (2.22)–(2.24). 
Step 4: Set the iteration index i i = +1 and select Np chromosomes from the 
2Np feasible chromosomes in Step 3 through the nondominated sorting 
method to be the population Pi+1
. 
Step 5: Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until the iteration number Ni is reached. If the 
iteration number Ni
 is satisfed, then set PN = PF as the Pareto front. i 
Step 6: Select a “preferable” objective individual ( , * * a a ) Î P according to 2 ¥ F 
the designer’s preference with the optimal W* = P* - () 1
. Then the multi- * -1 T * objective H2/H∞ control u t() = -R B P x( )t . 
Remark 2.4: The previous reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA for multi￾objective H2/H∞ control design in (2.10)–(2.12) could be easily extended to the more 
general MOP in (2.4) or (2.5)–(2.6) if objective functions J u i = ,..., N are given. i( ), 1 
2.3 MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION CONTROL DESIGN 
PROBLEMS OF NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS 
Since most physical systems are nonlinear, it is more appealing to discuss the MOPs 
of control design of nonlinear stochastic systems for more practical applications. 
Consider the following nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion systems [6, 7, 11–13] 
dx() t = f ( ( x t)) + g x( (t u )) () t + h( ( xt )) v t() + l x( (td )) w t() (2.28) 
+ d x( (t d )) pt ( )18 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
n m where the vector x t() Î ˜ , control input u t() Î ˜ , and external disturbance v t() Î ˜l 
. 
w t() Î ˜ is the standard Wiener process, and l x( (td )) w t( ) denotes continuous intrinsic 
random fuctuation. p t( ) denotes the Poisson counting process with mean l in a unit 
of time, and d x( (t d )) pt ( ) is regarded as intrinsic discontinuous random fuctuation 
(jumping process). The nonlinear functional vector f x t ˜n ( ( )) Î , input functional nm n l matrix g x( (t )) Î ˜ , and disturbance coupling functional matrix h x t ´ ( ( )) Î ˜ ´ 
n n l x( (t )) Î ˜ and d x( (t )) Î ° must satisfy the Lipschitz continuity to guarantee the
unique solution of (2.28). 
For the nonlinear stochastic jump-diffusion system in (2.28), the multi-objective 
optimization problem for the control design can be formulated as follows 
min(J u( ),..., J u( ),..., J u( )) 1 i N u t( )ÎU (2.29) 
subject to (2.28) 
Since it is not easy to solve the MOP in (2.29) directly, the following suboptimal 
method is employed to solve it indirectly. 
* * * ( , a ...,a ,...,a ) = min( , a ...,a ,...,a ) (2.30) 1 i N 1 i N u t( )ÎU 
subject to (2.28) and J u( (t)) £ a ,i = 1,..., N (2.31) i i 
Lemma 2.1: The suboptimal solution of the MOP in (2.30) and (2.31) for the non￾linear stochastic jump diffusion system in (2.28) is equivalent to the optimal solution 
of the MOP in (2.29). 
Proof: Similar to the proof in Theorem 2.1. 
From Lemma 2.1, the MOP in (2.29) for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion 
system in (2.28) can be solved via the MOP in (2.30) and (2.31). For a simple illus￾tration of the MOP of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion system in (2.28), the 
following multi-objective H2/H∞ control design is given as a design example of the 
MOP in (2.30) and (2.31).

Multi-Objective Optimization Design for Stochastic Systems 19 
Before solving the MOP in (2.32)–(2.34), the Itô-Lévy formula of a nonlinear 
stochastic jump diffusion system is given as follows [12]: 
dV xt = V x t x
T ( ( )) ( ( ))[ f ( ( xt )) + g x( (t u )) () t + h( ( xt )) vt ( )] dt

Based on the Itô-Lévy formula in (2.35), we get the following result: 
Theorem 2.3: The MOP of the H2/H∞ control strategy in (2.32)–(2.34) can be 
solved as follows

Proof: Please refer to Appendix 2.5.2. 
Since the HJIs in (2.39) and (2.41) are nonlinear partial differential inequality 
equations, it is very diffcult to solve the HJI-constrained MOP in (2.38)–(2.41) for 
the multi-objective H2/H∞ control strategy for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion 
system in (2.28). In this chapter, the global linearization method [9, 19] is employed 
to interpolate with a set of local linearized systems at the vertices of the polytope to 
approximate the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion system in (2.28). This can over￾come the diffcult in solving the HJI-constrained MOP in (2.38)–(2.41). This leads

Normally, we can say that the trajectory x t( ) of the nonlinear stochastic jump dif￾fusion system in (2.28) can be represented by the convex combination of the tra￾jectories of the following J local linearized stochastic systems at J vertices of the 
polytope if the convex hull C0 consists of all local linearized systems at all [9, 19]

Based on the global linearization theory [19], the trajectory x t( ) of the nonlinear sto￾chastic jump diffusion system in (2.28) can be represented by a convex combination 
of the trajectories of the J local linearized stochastic jump diffusion systems in (2.43) 
as follows: 
J 
åi =1 
+ D x() t dp t( ) i 
dx t() = h ( ( xt ))( ( ) A x t B + u t( ) + H v(t d )) t C+ x t( )dw t( ) i i i i i (2.44) 
where h x i(( t i )), = 1,..., J denotes the interpolation functions with 0 £ h x i( (t )) £ 1 and J
å h x( (t)) = 1; that is, we can replace the trajectory of the nonlinear stochastic i 
= 
= 
jump diffusion system in (2.28) with the trajectory of the interpolated stochastic 
system in (2.44). 
Remark 2.5: Except the global linearization method, there are other interpolation 
methods to interpolate local linearized stochastic systems by different interpolation 
functions to effciently approximate a nonlinear stochastic system, for example, the 
T-S fuzzy method through the interpolatory fuzzy bases [6, 7, 11, 12]. 
Lemma 2.2 ([7, 11]): For any matrix Si with appropriate dimensions and

modifcations. 
2.4 CONCLUSION 
In this chapter, we investigate the MOPs of multi-objective stabilization control strat￾egies of linear and nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion systems. Further, the MOPs 
of multi-objective H2/H∞ stabilization control strategies of linear and nonlinear sto￾chastic jump diffusion systems with external disturbance are given as design exam￾ples to illustrate the design procedure of MOPs in the multi-objective optimization 
control design of linear and nonlinear jump diffusion systems with external distur￾bance. A reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA is also proposed to treat the MOPs 
of multi-objective stabilization control of linear and nonlinear stochastic jump diffu￾sion systems with external disturbance. These results can be easily extended to the 
MOPs of multi-objective flter design in signal processing [9, 14–16], power control 
of wireless communication networks [17, 18], or multi-objective observer-based 
tracking control design of linear and nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion systems in 
the following chapters.

3 Multi-Objective H2/H∞ 
Stabilization Control 
Strategies of Nonlinear 
Stochastic Systems 
3.1 INTRODUCTION 
Since many stochastic systems in engineering, economics, and biology contain both 
continuous and Poisson jump processes—an Itô-Lévy type system [10, 20–24]—H2 
and H control design for stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion systems is an active ∞ 
feld. The H2 control strategy is an important optimal control design for minimizing 
a desired control performance index, such as a cost function [25–27]. The H∞ control 
strategy is an important robust control design for eliminating the effects of external 
disturbances on control performance, and it has been employed to handle robust 
control problems with uncertain disturbances [28–31]. H2 and H∞ control design 
problems for linear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion systems have been widely dis￾cussed in the last decade [32–35], but few studies discuss the control design prob￾lems of nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion systems. In practice, designers 
always expect the system controller to be not only robust but also optimal. Combin￾ing the advantages of both the H2 and H∞ controls, a stochastic mixed H2/H∞ control 
design has been proposed [36, 37] and realized in practical linear stochastic Poisson 
jump-diffusion system control problems [35]. However, the stochastic mixed H2/H∞ 
control design is employed to design a controller that minimizes the H2 performance 
index under the constraint of a prescribed H∞ attenuation level (i.e., a constrained 
single-objective optimization problem (SOP)), thus providing a suboptimal solution 
for robust controller design. In this chapter, we provide a multi-objective control 
design for nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion systems with external dis￾turbances. Unlike the conventional mixed H2/H∞ control design, the multi-objective 
control problem is defned as how to design a controlled input u t( ) to simultaneously 
minimize the H2 and H∞ control performance indices in the Pareto optimal sense for 
nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion systems. 
The multi-objective control problem appears in [38, 39]. Since the H2 and H∞ 
control performance indices generally compete for the admissible control input u t( ), 
they can be regarded as conficting with one another in a multi-objective optimi￾zation problem. In fact, for a multi-objective control problem, it is impossible to 
improve the H2 performance index without deteriorating the H∞ performance index, 
and vice versa. Moreover, there exists no unique solution u t( ) corresponding to both 
the minimum values of the H2 and H∞ performance indices. Rather, there exists a set 30 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
of feasible optimal solutions for the multi-objective control design problem in the 
Pareto optimal sense. The “optimal” design of the MOP for the nonlinear stochastic 
Poisson jump-diffusion system can be seen as how to select a preferred solution from 
the Pareto front to obtain the Pareto optimal solution. 
There are two main diffculties in solving the multi-objective control problem for 
nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion systems. The frst issue is that the Pareto 
front of the multi-objective control problem is diffcult to obtain through direct calcu￾lation. The second is that the Hamilton-Jacobi inequalities for the nonlinear stochastic 
Poisson jump-diffusion system are also diffcult to solve. For the frst issue, an indirect 
method is proposed for solving the MOP of multi-objective control by simultaneously 
minimizing the upper bounds ( , a b ) of the H2 and H∞ performance indices. By applying 
the proposed indirect method, the multi-objective control problem can be transformed 
into an HJI-constrained MOP (i.e., the solutions of the multi-objective control for a non￾linear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion system are constrained by two HJIs). However, 
the HJIs are still diffcult to solve except in some special cases. For the second issue, 
the T-S fuzzy interpolation method [2, 40, 41] is introduced to approximate the nonlin￾ear stochastic jump-diffusion system by interpolating a set of linear stochastic jump￾diffusion systems. Based on the T-S fuzzy interpolation scheme, a set of linear matrix 
inequalities can replace the HJIs. Thus, the HJI-constrained MOP can be replaced by an 
LMI-constrained MOP. Therefore, the multi-objective control for nonlinear stochastic 
Poisson jump-diffusion systems becomes an issue of how to specify a set of T-S fuzzy m control gains {} =1 K to minimize ( , a b ), simultaneously subject to a set of LMI con- ii 
straints, where m is the number of local linear models used to approximate the nonlinear 
stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion system via the T-S fuzzy interpolation method and a 
and b are the upper bounds of H2 and H∞ control performance, respectively. 
The LMI-constrained MOP is quite different from the conventional MOP with 
algebraic constraints in Chapter 1. Recently, many MOEAs for Pareto optimality have 
been proposed for solving MOPs [38, 42], but most have been limited to static sys￾tems, which lead to algebraic functional constraints. Hence, much work is necessary 
to apply the MOEA to the multi-objective control problem for nonlinear stochastic 
Poisson jump-diffusion systems. In this chapter, based on the indirect method and the 
T-S fuzzy interpolation method, we propose a reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA 
for the multi-objective control design problem of nonlinear stochastic jump-diffusion 
systems. The reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA searches for the Pareto front 
of the multi-objective control strategy for the nonlinear stochastic jump-diffusion 
system via evolution operators and a nondominated sorting scheme. By gradually 
decreasing ( , a b ) simultaneously and maintaining its domination via a nondominat￾ing sorting scheme, the Pareto optimal solution set of the multi-objective control for 
the nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion system can be approached indirectly. 
As long as the Pareto front is obtained, the multi-objective control design problem 
for the nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion system can be solved, since each * * * vector (, a b ) of the Pareto front P corresponds to a group of T-S fuzzy control front * m gains {} =1 , guaranteeing that the H2 and H∞ K control performance indices ( , a b ) are ii 
minimized simultaneously. Finally, we give a multi-objective missile pursuit system 
with cheating jets and a wind-gust disturbance as an example to illustrate the design 
procedure and confrm the performance of the proposed design method.  
Multi-Objective H 31 2/H∞ Stabilization Control Strategies 
This chapter provides an effcient method to transform the multi-objective con￾trol problem of nonlinear Poisson jump-diffusion systems into an LMI-constrained 
MOP, which can be effciently solved with the help of the proposed LMI-constrained 
MOEA search method. Once the Pareto front is obtained, the designer can select 
an T-S fuzzy controller from the Pareto optimal solution set Pse

preference. 
This chapter is divided into fve sections. In Section 3.2, we describe a nonlin￾ear stochastic Poisson jump system with jump noise. We defne the multi-objective 
control problem in Section 3.3, where we apply an indirect method for solving the 
multi-objective control problem of a nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion 
system by minimizing the upper bounds ( , a b ) simultaneously. In Section 3.4, we 
propose multi-objective control via the T-S fuzzy method to transform the HJI￾constrained MOP into an LMI-constrained MOP. The multi-objective controller 
design via the LMI-constrained MOEA is introduced in Section 3.5. A simulation 
example of guidance control of a missile of a missile pursuit system is given in Sec￾tion 3.6, and conclusions are given in Section 3.7.

3.2 PRELIMINARIES 
For increased versatility of theories in this chapter, we assume the Poisson jump 
process to be a marked Poisson point process, and its defnition is given as follows:

Let (, t W F F,,) P be a fltration probability space. Here, F is the σ-algebra gener- t

satisfed with Lipschitz continuity. nx The càdlàg process x t() Î ˜ is the state vector; the initial state vector x( ) 0 = x0; ny 2 + nu y t() Î () Î LF ˜ is the controlled output vector; the input vector ut (˜ ˜; ) is the 2 + nv admissible control law with respect to { } F ; v t() Î L ( ; ˜ ˜ ) is regarded as an t t³0 F nQ unknown fnite-energy stochastic external disturbance; and the term QÎ ˜ is the 
mark space of the Poisson random measure N d( ,t dq ). Since a one-dimensional stand￾ard Wiener process W t( ) is a continuous but nondifferentiable stochastic process, the 
term s( ( xt ))dW t( ) can be regarded as a continuous state dependent internal distur￾bance. The integral term òQ T x(( t
- ),q )( N dt d, q ) , caused by a nonlinear discontinuous
change of the system in (3.2) at the time instant t , is used to denote the Poisson 
jump, where the jump amplitude depends on the jump amplitude coeffcient function 
T x( (t - ),q ). Moreover, the Wiener process W t( ) and Poisson jump process P( )t are 
assumed to be mutually independent for all t ³ 0 (i.e., E{[òQ N dt d (, q )]dW t( )} = 0).

In this chapter, without loss of generality, we assume that (a) the system states of 
the nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion system in (3.2) are available, and 
(b) (3.2) has an equilibrium point at the origin of ˜nx
 (i.e., xeq = 0). If the equilibrium 
point of the nonlinear stochastic system of interest with a Poisson jump process is not 
at the origin point, then the designer can shift it to the origin by changing variables.

3.3 MULTI-OBJECTIVE STATE FEEDBACK CONTROL 
FOR THE NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC 
POISSON JUMP-DIFFUSION SYSTEM 
Roughly speaking, an optimization problem is defned as an MOP if there does not 
exist a single solution that is simultaneously optimal with respect to every objective 
function. The H2 control design focuses on keeping the energy of system states and 
admissible control laws as low as possible. However, with respect to the H¥ control 
design, a better H¥ performance index is always coupled with a higher input energy 
cost. As a result, the aims of H2 and H¥ control design confict with each other. Thus, 
the concurrent optimization problem for the H2 and H¥ performance indices is an 
MOP with a dynamic constraint (dynamic-constrained MOP).  
34 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
Defnition 3.4 ([22]): The multi-objective control of a given nonlinear stochastic 
Poisson jump-diffusion system is to design an admissible control law u t( ) that can 
minimize the H2 and H¥ performance indices in the Pareto optimal sense simultane￾ously, that is: 
min(J u(( t J )), (( u t))) u t( )ÎU 2 ¥ 
(3.7) 
subject to (3.2) 
where U is the set of all the admissible control laws for the given nonlinear stochastic 
system in (3.2); the objective functions J u( (t)) and J u t 2 ¥ (( )) are defned in (3.3) and 
(3.5), respectively; and the vector of the objective functions ( ( 2 ( )), ¥ J u t J (( ut ))) is
called the objective vector of u t( ). 
For an MOP, the domination concept is employed to decide which admissible 
control law is better; that is, we use domination to defne the “simultaneous min￾imization” in the MOP in (3.7). Thus, the solution of the MOP in (3.7) is a set of 
admissible control laws with a nondominated objective vector. The defnition of 
domination is given as follows: 
Defnition 3.5 ([2, 22]): For a multi-objective control problem, an objective vec￾ˆ tor ( , a b ) of ut ( ) is said to dominate another objective vector ( , a b ˆ ) of u t ˆ( ) if 
and only if both the following conditions are true: (I) aa £ ˆ £ ˆ and b b, and 
(II) at least one of the two inequalities in (I) with strict inequality. Moreover, 
the admissible control law u t( ) is regarded as a better solution than u t ˆ( ). 
Unfortunately, there is no effcient method to directly solve the control u t( ) of the 
MOP in (3.7). Thus, we introduce an indirect method to help us solve the MOP in (3.7). 
Lemma 3.2 ([15, 43]): Suppose a and b are the upper bounds of the H2 and H¥ 
performance indices, respectively; that is, J u( (t )) £ ¥ ( ( )) £ b. The MOP in 2 a and J u t 
(3.7) is equivalent to the following MOP: 
min ( , a b ) u t( )ÎU (3.8) 
subject to J u t £ a and ( ( )) 2 ( ( )) J u t ¥ £ b 
Lemma 3.3 ([10]): For any two real matrices A and B with appropriate dimen￾sions, we have: 
T T 2 T -2 T A B + B A £ g A A + g BB 
where g is any nonzero real number. 
By applying Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3 and the Itô-Lévy formula in (3.6), we can obtain 
the suffcient condition to design an admissible control law u t() to minimize ( , a b ) 
under the constraints J u t a and J u t b for the MOP in (3.8) of the non- 2 ( ( )) £ ¥ ( ( )) £ 
linear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion system in (3.2). For convenience, we use J2 
and J¥ to denote J u( (t)) and J u t 2 ¥ (( )) in (3.3) and (3.5), respectively.

and 
EV {( x0 )} £ a (3.15) 
hold, then we have J2 £ a. Based on this analysis, if the control law u t( ) is a feasible 
solution of the MOP in (3.9) under the constraints of (3.13), (3.14), and (3.15), then 
u t( ) will ensure that J2 £ a and J¥ £ b in (3.8) simultaneously. Therefore, the solu￾tions of the MOP in (3.9) are also the solutions of the MOP in (3.8). 
Note that the inequalities in (3.13) and (3.14) are the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs ine￾quality (HJII) and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman inequality (HJBI) of the nonlinear sto￾chastic Poisson jump-diffusion system in (3.2), respectively. 
Remark 3.2: In many practical applications, the nonlinear stochastic Poisson 
jump-diffusion system may only have fnite marks (i.e., Q = { , q q2 , ,q 1 … m}). In this 
situation, the integral of the Poisson random measure with respect to Q can be rewrit￾ten as: 
ò { , 1 , , } N d( ,t dq ) = å

Now (3.2) can be rewritten as:

To treat the multi-objective control problem in (3.9), we also need to defne the sta￾bility of the nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion system in (3.2). 
Defnition 3.6 ([44]): Suppose xeq = 0 is an equilibrium point of the following 
nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion system:

The nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion system in (3.18) is said to be expo￾nentially mean square stable (i.e., stable in the mean square sense) if, for some posi￾tive constants C1 and C2, the following inequality holds: 
{ 2

Theorem 3.2: For the nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion system in (3.2), 
suppose the given Lyapunov function V x(( t)), which satisfes the following two 
inequalities: 
m x() t 2

where m1 > 0 and m2 > 0. If the external noise v t() = 0, and u t( ) is a solution of MOP 
in (3.9), then u t( ) stabilizes (3.2) exponentially in the mean square sense. 
Proof: By the Itô-Lévy formula of V x(( t )) in (3.6) and the fact that ut ( ) is a feasible
solution of (3.14), we obtain:

We obtain limt®¥ x t() = 0 (e.g., x t( ) exponentially in the mean square sense). 
Based on Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, the multi-objective control design problem is equiv￾alent to how to solve the MOP in (3.9) for (3.2) with HJII and HJBI constraints in (3.13) 
and (3.14). Although the multi-objective control for the nonlinear stochastic Poisson 
jump-diffusion system in (3.2) can be reformulated as an MOP in (3.9) via the proposed 
indirect method, the HJII and HJBI are still diffcult to solve except in special cases. 
3.4 MULTI-OBJECTIVE STATE-FEEDBACK CONTROL 
FOR THE NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC T-S 
FUZZY JUMP-DIFFUSION SYSTEM 
To accomplish the multi-objective state-feedback control design for the nonlinear sto￾chastic jump-diffusion system in (3.2), one needs to solve the HJII in (3.13) and the 
HJBI in (3.14), which are diffcult to solve analytically. To overcome this problem, 
the T-S fuzzy interpolation method is introduced [6, 40, 45]. A fuzzy dynamic model 
will be applied to interpolate several local linearized stochastic systems around some 
operation points to approximate the nonlinear stochastic jump-diffusion system in 
(3.2). This fuzzifed model is described by a group of if-then rules and is used to 
simplify the multi-objective H H/ state-feedback control design for the nonlinear 2 ¥ 
stochastic jump-diffusion system in (3.2). 
The ith rule of the T-S fuzzy model for approximating the nonlinear stochastic 
jump-diffusion system in (3.2) is given as follows: 
System Rule f i : or i = 1 ,..., m
If z t( ) is G and z ( )t is G & , and z t( ) is G , 1 i,1 2 i,2 g i,g 
then 
B u t i ìdx t() = [A x t ( )] t D x t dW t( ) i ( ) + ( ) + v td + i () 
ï -
í + òQ Ei( ) q x( ) t N(, dt dq ) 
ïy t() = M x( )t î i 
where Ai
, Bi
, Ci
, Di
, and Mi
 are constant matrices with appropriate dimensions, and 
Ei( ) q is a matrix function of mark vector q with appropriate dimensions, that is, 
x E : ˜nq ® ˜n ; z t( ),..., z t( ) are fuzzy premise variables, and G is the membership i 1 g i j , 
function with respect to z t( ) for j = 1 2, ,..., g. j 
Thus, the overall fuzzy nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion system can be 
inferred as follows: 
m ì
dx t () = h ( (zt )){[A x( ) t + B ut ( ) + vt ( )] dt + D x( )t dW t( ) ï å i i i i

h z() = 1 i m i 
mi å ( (zt )) i=1 i=1 
Similarly, the control input u t( ) for the nonlinear stochastic jump-diffusion system 
in (3.2) can be approximated by the following fuzzy control input: 
The ith T-S fuzzy control law for the corresponding local system is given as 
Control Rule f i : or i = 1 ,...,m 
If zt () () is G and z t is G & , and zt( ) is G , 1 i,1 2 i,2 g i,g 
Then u t() = K x( )t i i 
where Ki , i = 1,...,m are constant matrices with appropriate dimensions. 
The overall T-S fuzzy controller for the nonlinear stochastic T-S fuzzy Poisson 
jump-diffusion system in (3.24) can be interpolated as: 
å 
m 
u t() = h z(( t K ))( x t( )) (3.25) i i 
i=1 
Substituting (3.25) into the T-S fuzzy system in (3.24) yields the closed-loop system 
of the following form: 
dx t() = å

- + D x() t dWt () E ( ) q x( ) t N(, dt dq ) i + òQ i 
Even though the T-S fuzzy interpolation method can effciently refect the system 
behavior, we still need to consider the effect of approximation errors of the T-S fuzzy 
interpolation method because they can affect the stability and control performance 
of the system. 
After counting the approximation errors of T-S fuzzy interpolation method, (3.2) 
can be represented as:

Remark 3.3: If the Poisson mark is fnite (i.e., Q = { , q1 ...,q m }, then the terms Xi j ,

Theorem 3.4: For the nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion system in (3.2), ˆ if the external noise v t() = 0, and ( , a b ˆ ) is a feasible solution of (3.29), then the T-S 
fuzzy control signal u t() = åm h x( )(K x( t)) stabilizes the nonlinear stochastic Pois- i=1 i i 
son jump-diffusion system in (3.2) exponentially in the mean square sense. 
Proof: Because the proof is similar to that of Theorem 3.2, we omit it. 
Now the multi-objective control design problem for the nonlinear stochastic Pois￾son jump-diffusion system in (3.2) can be regarded as how to search for a feasible 
solution x = W Y1, , Y ..., 2 Ym {, } that satisfes the LMIs in (3.30)–(3.32) and minimizes
( , a b ) in (3.29) simultaneously in the Pareto optimality sense. Although many 
MOEAs have been proposed for solving MOPs with algebraic function constraints, it 
is very diffcult to search x = W Y1, , Y ..., 2 Ym {, } by MOEA to solve the LMI-constrained 
MOP in (3.29)–(3.32). Few researchers have discussed the LMI-constrained MOP in 
(3.29). To overcome the LMI-constrained MOP in (3.29), in the next section, we will 
introduce the reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA. 
3.5 MULTI-OBJECTIVE STATE FEEDBACK CONTROLLER 
DESIGN BY USING THE PROPOSED REVERSE￾ORDER LMI-CONSTRAINED MOEA 
The conventional MOEA is used to solve multi-objective problems via a stochas￾tic search method based on a “survival of the fttest” law. The MOEA derives a 
set of compromise solutions called Pareto optimal solutions through the evolu￾tion algorithm, including crossover, mutation, and a nondominated sort operator 
[2, 38, 42]. Since the MOEA can search the Pareto optimal solutions in paral￾lel globally and escape from local optima, it is particularly suitable for solving 
MOPs of nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion systems. However, the con￾straints in (3.30)–(3.32) on the MOP in (3.29) are a set of LMIs. To solve the 
LMI-constrained MOP, some modifcations to the MOEA are necessary. Prior to 
further discussion, we note some important defnitions about Pareto optimality for 
the LMI-constrained MOEA. Multi-Objective H 45 2/H∞ Stabilization Control Strategies

maximum number of individuals Ng = 50, the iteration number Ns = 70, the crosso￾ver rate Mc = 0 8. , and the mutation rate Mr = 0 2. . * Once the iteration number Ns is achieved, the Pareto front Pfront of the MOP for

To illustrate how to select the preferred solution, we choose three Pareto optimal

given as follows:

Moreover, the T-S fuzzy control gains of the three chosen Pareto optimal solutions 
are given in Tables 3.1–3.3 in the Appendix, respectively. The simulation results in 
Figures 3.3 to 3.7 are given to illustrate the performance of the multi-objective T-S 
fuzzy control of the three chosen Pareto optimal solutions. In Figure 3.3, Pareto opti￾mal solution 1 has the largest J2 performance index of the three chosen Pareto opti￾mal solutions because the integral value of its trajectory with respect to t is the largest 
of the three. However, with respect to Pareto optimal solution 3, its trajectory has 
the minimum integral value with respect to time. Thus, it has the smallest J2 perfor￾mance index of the three. In Figure 3.5, since Pareto optimal solution 1 has the best 
J∞ performance index of the three chosen Pareto optimal solutions, its trajectory is 
robust with less vibration of the tangential relative velocity when the Poisson jumps 50 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

index, it is less robust and has the most serious vibration of the three solutions. It is 
easy to observe that Pareto solution 2 is the preferred solution of the three chosen 
Pareto solutions because Pareto optimal vector 2 provides a compromise between J2 
and J∞. Finally, the trajectories of the marked Poisson jump processes in (3.47) are 
given in Figure 3.8. 
3.7 CONCLUSION 
This chapter investigated multi-objective control for nonlinear stochastic Pois￾son jump-diffusion systems via the T-S fuzzy interpolation method. Unlike most 
MOPs that only focus on algebraic systems, the proposed multi-objective control 
design method can handle dynamically constrained MOPs and simultaneously 
achieve the H2 optimal cost and H¥ robustness performance indices of a nonlin￾ear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion system. To avoid solving the HJIs, the T-S 
fuzzy interpolation method is employed, and these HJI constraints can be replaced 
by two sets of LMI constraints (i.e., the HJI-constrained MOP can be transformed 
into an LMI-constrained MOP). If there exist some feasible solutions for the LMI 
constraints in (3.30)–(3.32), then the LMI-constrained MOP can be solved by the 
proposed reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA. Thus, the multi-objective control 
design problem of the nonlinear stochastic Poisson jump-diffusion systems can be 
effciently solved with the help of the LMI toolbox of the commercial MATLAB

software. When the Pareto front is obtained, the designer can select a preferred T-S 
fuzzy controller from the set of Pareto optimal controllers according to their prefer￾ence and complete the multi-objective T-S fuzzy controller design. Finally, we gave 
an example of stochastic homing missile control design to confrm the performance 
of the proposed multi-objective control design for nonlinear stochastic Poisson 
jump-diffusion systems through a computer simulation.

4 Multi-Objective Tracking 
Control Design of 
T-S Fuzzy Systems 
Fuzzy Pareto Optimal 
Approach 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
After the MOP of H2/H∞ stabilization control of nonlinear stochastic systems has been 
introduced in Chapter 3, the MOP of H2/H∞ tracking control design of nonlinear T-S 
fuzzy systems will be introduced in this chapter. In system control design, the tasks 
of stabilization and tracking are two typical control design problems. Many control 
design techniques have been developed for nonlinear system control designs, for 
example, exact feedback linearization [48, 49], sliding mode control [48], and adap￾tive control [48]. Fuzzy control has been employed successfully to solve many nonlin￾ear control problems [50, 51]. Recently, many robust fuzzy tracking control schemes 
have been developed for nonlinear tracking control design problems [52–61]. In gen￾eral, tracking control design problems are more diffcult than fuzzy stabilization con￾trol design problems because they need to track a prescribed reference signal. 
In [52], the feedback linearization technique was proposed to design a fuzzy track￾ing controller for discrete time systems. As pointed out in [58, 61], fuzzy controllers 
based on feedback linearization may be not guaranteed to be stable for nonminimum 
phase systems because of their inverse system design method. Recently, the optimal 
H2 tacking control design was proposed for nonlinear stochastic systems to achieve 
the least mean square tracking error [58, 61–64]. In general, the optimal H2 tracking 
control design can be achieved only when the statistics of stochastic disturbances are 
available. Otherwise, its performance will be degraded if the statistics of stochas￾tic disturbance are incorrect. To remedy the shortcomings of H2 tracking, a robust 
control design based on H∞ tracking has received great attention for its robustness 
properties against uncertain disturbance without the knowledge of the statistics of 
disturbances. In [53], based on the T-S fuzzy model, a robust H∞ tracking control 
design was proposed for nonlinear dynamic systems with external disturbance. An 
effective matrix decoupling technique was developed to derive a single-step LMI 
condition for the observer-based H∞ control design [65]. In [29, 66–69], the H∞ fuzzy 
control was studied for many different systems to achieve H∞ control performance. 
Recently, mixed H2/H∞ tracking designs [34, 70–75] were proposed to minimize 
the H2 tracking error with the consideration of a prescribed H∞ attenuation level to 56 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
eliminate the infuence of uncertain disturbances. However, the conventional mixed 
H2/H∞ tracking control design is an optimal H2 tracking control under a prescribed 
H∞ attenuation constraint and basically is only a constrained single-objective prob￾lem for tracking control design. In this chapter, the proposed multi-objective tracking 
control design can achieve the optimal H2 and robust H∞ tracking performance for 
fuzzy systems simultaneously. 
Although most existing studies capture characteristics of tracking control designs 
in the form of SOPs, multiple objectives arise naturally in real-life scenarios. These 
objectives normally confict with each other; in other words, these objectives cannot 
be optimized simultaneously. In general, the optimal solution of multiple objectives 
is not unique, and there may exist many optimal solutions for multiple objectives. 
In contrast to fnding the global optimal solution in SOPs, Pareto optimal solutions 
have been proposed for MOPs [76–78]. Classical optimization methods suggest con￾verting an MOP to SOP by emphasizing one particular Pareto optimal solution by a 
weighted sum method at a time [78]. When such a method is used to fnd multiple 
solutions of an MOP, it has to be applied with different weightings many times, 
hopefully fnding a different solution in each simulation run. Recently, a number of 
multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been discussed for their ability to fnd 
multiple Pareto optimal solutions for algebraic systems in one single simulation run 
[2, 76–79]. From a recent review paper about multi-objective fuzzy control [80], it is 
seen that the work of multi-objective control of fuzzy logical systems can be divided 
into two categories: (i) identifcation of control parameters and/or rules (e.g. tuning 
of membership function parameters and rule selection as a post-processing method) 
and (ii) learning controller structure (e.g. learning rule bases); that is, at present, a 
MOEA is employed to learn the fuzzy controller based on a fuzzy rule-based system 
and still cannot be applied to the multi-objective control design problems of T-S 
fuzzy dynamic systems [80–82]. Even though MOEAs have been employed widely 
to solve MOPs of algebraic or rule-based systems, it is still not easy to apply them to 
solve MOPs of nonlinear dynamic systems at present. More effort is still needed to 
apply them to multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design problems for nonlinear 
dynamic systems. In general, MOPs for nonlinear dynamic systems are more diff￾cult than how to specify variables to minimize the multi-objective functions in the 
conventional MOPs of algebraic or rule-based systems. 
Recently, T-S fuzzy systems have been used to effciently approximate nonlinear 
dynamic systems [70, 83–88]. In this chapter, the H2 and H∞ tracking control prob￾lems are formulated as an MOP for fuzzy systems with uncertain measurement noises 
and disturbances. The H2 tracking performance needs to be minimized for the mini￾mum tracking error. Similarly, the robust H∞ tracking performance also needs to be 
minimized for the minimum worst-case effects of measurement noise and disturbance 
on the tracking error. Therefore, the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design 
needs to minimize H2 tracking and robust H∞ tracking performance simultaneously. In 
general, it is not easy to solve this multi-objective tracking control design problem for 
fuzzy systems directly. In this chapter, the MOP for H2/H∞ tracking control design of 
fuzzy systems is solved from the indirect perspective. Based on three LMI constraints 
and the proposed indirect technique, we fnd the H2 tracking and robust H∞ tracking 
performance have the upper bounds a and b, respectively. Therefore, the indirect  
Multi-Objective Tracking Control Design of T-S Fuzzy Systems 57 
method of multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design becomes how to specify the 
fuzzy control gains to minimize the upper bounds (a b ) simultaneously subject to 
sets of LMIs. We also show that the proposed indirect MOP is equivalent to the orig￾inal MOP for multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design of fuzzy systems when 
Pareto optimal solutions are achieved. In summary, as compared with the conventional 
mixed H2/H∞ tracking control designs, which solve the optimal H2 tracking control 
problem under the constraint of a prescribed robust H∞ tracking performance, that is, 
to minimize a under a prescribed H∞ attenuation level b, the proposed multi-objective 
H2/H∞ tracking control design needs to minimize a and b simultaneously. 
In this chapter, in order to solve the simultaneous optimization of the MOP for the 
multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design for fuzzy systems, the LMI technique 
and an MOEA based on nondominating sorting scheme [2, 76, 79] are combined 
together. Hence, the LMI-constrained MOP can be solved by an LMI-based MOEA 
search method via a nondominating sorting scheme to achieve optimal H2 and robust 
H∞ tracking performance simultaneously. The feasible solutions and the computa￾tional complexities of LMI-constrained MOP are also discussed in this chapter. Since 
an LMI is convex, the LMI-constrained MOP for fuzzy systems is always feasible 
and can be solved effciently by the convex optimization scheme [89] via the pro￾posed LMI-based MOEA search method [2, 76, 79] with the help of the LMI toolbox 
in MATLAB. Further, for comparison, the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control 
design based on the weighted sum method and the conventional mixed H2/H∞ track￾ing control method are also solved for fuzzy systems as an alternative choice. 
Because there exist sets of feasible optimal solutions, the LMI and MOEA tech￾niques are employed to solve the LMI-constrained MOP. An LMI-based MOEA 
search via a number of genetic operators, such as selection, mutation, and crossover, 
is proposed with the help of the LMI toolbox in MATLAB to search for the sets of 
Pareto optimal solutions for fuzzy control gains from the LMI constraints. Hence, 
one of Pareto optimal solutions is selected to achieve a multi-objective H2/H∞ track￾ing performance by the designer according to their preference. Finally, a simulation 
example of an MOP of H2/H∞ tracking control of a two-link robot system is pro￾vided to illustrate the design procedure and confrm the performance of the proposed 
results for nonlinear robotic systems with external disturbance. 
Notations and Defnitions: I and 0 denote the identity and zero matrices with 
appropriate dimensions, respectively. Asymmetric matrix P >, <, ³, and £ 0 means 
that it is positive defnite, negative defnite, positive semidefnite, and negative sem￾idefnite, respectively. A block diagonal matrix is shown by diag( )× . 
In reality, there exist many solutions for an MOP, called Pareto optimal solutions. 
Comparison among Pareto optimal solutions requires an order relation, called dom￾ination, between different solutions. Before further discussion, take the following 
example to easily understand [76–78]. Consider an MOP with two objectives (a b ) 
and the decision variable W Î W, where W is the feasible set. Some properties of the 
Pareto optimal solutions of the MOP are given as follows [76–78].

Defnition 4.3 (Pareto front): For the MOP, the Pareto front defned as * * * * G ˙ {(a b ) W*

4.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND PROBLEM FORMULATION 
A nonlinear system can be represented by the T-S fuzzy model [83], which is a fuzzy 
piecewise interpolation of several local linear systems to approximate a nonlinear 
system via fuzzy bases. The T-S fuzzy model is described by fuzzy if-then rules as 
follows [70, 84–86] 
Plant Rule i 
If z t( ) is F and ° and z t() is F (4.1) 1 i1 g ig 
then x t ˇ() = A x() t + B u() t + Ew( )t ,for i = 1,...,l i i 
where x t() D éx t() x t() ° x t( ) D û

p 1 ´ Î n p Î R ´ is the external disturbance with the infuence matrix ER ; Fij is the fuzzy 
Î n n´ Î n m set; Ai R , Bi R ´ are the fuzzy system parameters; l is the number of if-then 
rules; and zt ( ),( z t),..., z t( ) are the premise variables. The T-S fuzzy system in (4.1) 1 2 g 
is employed to represent a nonlinear dynamic system, and the fuzzy system parame￾ters Ai and Bi
 can be identifed by the optimal parameter estimation method [62, 64, 
68, 69, 83, 86, 88]. Hence, the fuzzy system in (4.1) is inferred as follows [70, 84–86] 
l 
x t ˆ() = å h z( (t)) A x t() + B u() t + Ew( )t (4.2) i [ i i ] i=1 
where m ( ( )) = g F z t , ( ( )) = m z t l zt ( ( )) h z t (( )) / å ( z( )t ) with the property i Pj=1 ij j i i i=1 mi 
ål
i=1 i(( )) 1, and zt 1 () h z g t = () ˝ [z t ° z t( )]. The fuzzy model in (4.2) is an interpolation 
of local linear systems for general nonlinear dynamic systems and can be used to 
model the behaviors of complex dynamic systems [54]. Consider the following ref￾erence model to be tracked [54] 
l 
xt ˆ () = å h z( (t A)) x t() + r t( ) (4.3) r i ir r i=1 
where x t( ) is the desired reference state to be tracked, A is the matrix to be speci- r ir 
fed for the transient behavior of x t( ), and r t() is the bounded reference input to be r 
specifed by the user for any desired reference signal at the steady state. It is assumed 
that A and r t( ) are selected so that x t( ) represents a desired trajectory for x t( ) to ir r

track. Let us denote the tracking error e t() ˙ x t() - x t( ). It is more appealing to use r 
state feedback control to achieve the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking performance; 
therefore, we have the following fuzzy controller

( ( )) é

û u t() = å h z t ( ( ) - xt = å h z( (t K)) e t() (4.4) j j r j j j=1 j=1 
m n´ where Kj Î R is the fuzzy control gain to be designed. 
Remark 4.1: (i) In the previous fuzzy systems, the premise variable z t( ) can be 
measurable state variables, outputs, or a combination of measurable state variables. 
For the T-S fuzzy model, using state variables as premise variables is common but 
not always done [84, 85]. The limitation of this approach is that some state varia￾bles must be measurable to construct the fuzzy observer and controller [85]. This is 
common limitation for T-S fuzzy control design [7, 35]. (ii) The problem of how to 
construct T-S fuzzy models for nonlinear systems can be found in [83, 88]. 
After constructing the fuzzy system in (4.2) and the reference system in (4.3), the 
fuzzy augmented system can be expressed as follows 
x

Since the reference signal r t( ) is to be specifed by the user in the future and can 
be treated as an uncertain external input by designer, it can be included in the general 
disturbance w( )t . Additionally, the tracking error e t( ) can be represented by x( )t as 
follows 
e t() = [I 0] x( )t (4.6) 
Based on the fuzzy augmented system in (4.5), the H2 tracking performance without 
considering the effect of general disturbance w( )t can be represented by 
tf

tracking performance in (4.7) is to consider the penalty on both the quadratic tracking 2

disturbance w( )t , the robust H∞ tracking performance is given by

terminal time of control, and Q = I 0 T
[ ][ ] QI 0 . 2 2
Then the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control problem is given as follows: 
min(J u() J u( )) subject to (4.5) (4.9) 2 ¥ u t( )ÎU 
Where U denotes the feasible set of control laws, and J u( ) and J u( ) are defned in 2 ¥ 
(4.7) and (4.8), respectively. At present, most MOPs focus on static systems, and it is 
not easy to solve the MOP in (4.9) for the fuzzy augmented system in (4.5) directly. 
Remark 4.2: The conventional mixed H2/H∞ control designs are always consid￾ered multi-objective H2/H control designs by some authors [34, 70–75]. For the ∞ 
conventional mixed H2/H∞ tracking control design, one always minimizes the H2 
tracking performance J u( ) in (4.7) under a specifed robust H∞ tracking performance 2 
constraint J u ¥ () £ b with a given b in (4.8); that is, the conventional mixed H2/H∞ 
tracking control design is only a single-objective H2 tracking control design under a 
prescribed robust H∞ tracking performance constraint. More detailed discussion will 
be presented in the following sections. 
4.3 MULTI-OBJECTIVE H2/H∞ TRACKING CONTROL DESIGN 
Since there is some confict between J2 in (4.7) and J¥ in (4.8), there may not exist 
a unique solution for the MOP in (4.9). Further, because of the complexity of J2 
in (4.7), J in (4.8), and the fuzzy augmented system in (4.5), it is very diffcult to ¥ 
solve the MOP in (4.9) directly. Therefore, an indirect method is proposed to solve 
the MOP in (4.9) subject to J2 and J¥ indirectly. Suppose J2 £ a and J u ¥ () £ b; 
that is, a and b are the upper bounds of the H2 tracking and robust H∞ tracking 
performance, respectively. Then, the MOP in (4.9) is transformed into the following 
suboptimal MOP for the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design

Multi-Objective Tracking Control Design of T-S Fuzzy Systems 61 
The following result will prove that the suboptimal MOP in (4.10) is equivalent to the 
MOP in (4.9) for the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design when the Pareto 
optimal solutions of MOP are achieved. 
Theorem 4.1: The MOP in (4.10) is equivalent to the MOP in (4.9). 
Proof: The proof of Theorem 4.1 is straightforward. One only needs to prove 
that both inequality constraints in (4.11) and (4.12) become equality for the Pareto 
optimal solutions for the MOP in (4.10). Given a 3-tuple Pareto optimal solution * * * ( ( ut ),a b, ) , we assume that either one of the inequalities in (4.11) or (4.12)
remains a strict inequality at the optimal solution. Without loss of generality, sup￾pose J u( )* < a. As a result, there exists a such that a < a* and that J u( )* = a . 2 1 1 2 1 
Now, for the same u t( ), the solution ( , 1 dominates the Pareto optimal solution * a b*
) 
( , * * a b ) , leading to a contradiction [79, 89, 90]. This implies that both inequality
constraints in (4.11) and (4.12) indeed become equalities for Pareto optimal solu￾tions. The optimization problem in (4.10) is hence equivalent to the MOP in (4.9). 
Remark 4.3: (i) Based on Theorem 4.1, the MOP of the multi-objective H2/H∞ 
tracking control design problem in (4.9) can be replaced by the MOP in (4.10) with 
the inequality constraints in (4.11)–(4.12), which are much easier to solve. There￾fore, we focus on the MOP in (4.10) in sequence. (ii) For the robust H∞ tracking 
performance in (4.12), it is equivalent to 
t t f f 
ò T 
2 £ ò T x () () t Q x t dt b w ( )t w( )t dt (4.13) 0 0 
If the effect of initial condition x( ) 0 ¹ 0 is considered in the input/output ratio in 
(4.12) or (4.13), then the robust H∞ tacking performance in (4.13) should be modifed 
as follows [70, 86] 
t t f f 
T T T 
2 ò x () () t Q x t dt £ x ( ) 0 Px() 0 + b ò w () t w() t dt (4.14) 0 0 
for some matrix P > 0. 
Based on this analysis, we get the following result. 
Theorem 4.2: If the following MOP is solved,

the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design can be solved. In (4.15), W denotes 
the feasible set in which all elements of W must be satisfed with W > 0, P > 0, 11 22 
and (4.16)–(4.18). 
Proof: The proof is divided into two parts. The frst is for H2 tracking perfor￾mance, and the second is for robust H∞ tracking performance. Initially, we give the 
following Lyapunov function for the fuzzy augmented systems in (4.5) as 
T T T V() x ˝ e t() () P e t + x ( )t P x t() = x () t Px( )t (4.19) 11 r 22 r

hold, then we can conclude 
J2 £ a (4.24) 
That is, if the inequalities in (4.22)–(4.23) hold, then J2 is bounded by a. How￾ever, the inequality in (4.22) is the bilinear matrix inequality of P, Kj
. In general, it 
is not easy to solve a BMI, which could not be solved effciently by the convex opti￾mization technique with the help of the LMI toolbox in MATLAB. To solve the BMI 
in (4.22), we frst pre- and post-multiply the BMI in (4.22) by the matrix diag( W I 11, ) 
and further apply the Schur complement [90] to them; thus, we obtain the LMI in 
(4.16). Similarly, the inequality in (4.23) can be transformed into the LMI in (4.17). 
Consider the robust H∞ tracking performance part with x( ) 0 = 0. Similar to the T analysis in (4.20)–(4.21) with x ( ) tf Px( ) tf ³ 0 and x T ( ) 0 Px( ) 0 = 0, we obtain

64 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
In order to transform the BMI in (4.28) into the LMI in (4.18), we frst pre- and 
post-multiply the BMI in (4.28) by the matrix diag W( 11 ,,, III) and then use the Schur 
complement. In summary, if the LMIs in (4.16)–(4.18) hold, then J2 and J¥ have 
upper bounds a and b, respectively. Therefore, the MOP in (4.15) subject to the 
LMIs (4.16)–(4.18) can solve the MOP in (4.10) indirectly. 
Remark 4.4: Unlike the conventional MOP, which is only for the algebraic sys￾tems in Chapter 1 [2, 76–79], we develop the MOP for the optimal tracking control 
design in (4.15) for the fuzzy system in (4.2) with the fuzzy controller in (4.4) via the 
LMI approach. That is, the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design problem 
becomes how to solve the following MOP 
(a* b* ) = min (ab )
( 11 , 22 , ) W P Y j ÎW (4.30) 
subject to (4.16) - (4.18) 
Remark 4.5: (i) If we only consider the optimal H2 tracking control design prob￾lem, then the MOP in (4.30) is reduced to the following SOP 
min a 
(W P 11 22 , , ) Y j ÎW (4.31) 
subject to (4.16) - (4.17) 
(ii) If we only consider the optimal H tracking control design problem ∞ 
[6, 7, 12, 13], then the MOP in (4.30) is reduced to the following SOP 
min b (W P 11 22 , , ) Y j ÎW (4.32) 
subject to (4.18) 
(iii) In other studies [34, 52, 70–75], for example, the conventional mixed 
H2/H∞ tracking control design needs to solve the following SOP under the 
constraint of a prescribed attenuation level b of the robust H∞ tracking 
performance 
a 0 ˝ min a
(W P 11 22 , , ) Y j ÎW (4.33) 
subject to (4.16) - (4.18) 
As compared with the SOPs in (4.31)–(4.33), in which only one performance is 
minimized, the MOP in (4.30) needs to minimize a and b simultaneously. Obvi￾ously, the MOP in (4.30) for the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design is 
different from the SOPs in (4.31)–(4.33) in their design target and optimal solution 
method. In contrast to the SOPs in (4.31)–(4.33), the global optimal solution for 
the MOP in (4.30) may not exist. In other words, there exists no unique solution K* 
j 
such that a and b are minimized simultaneously. Hence, more effort is required for  
 
 
 
Multi-Objective Tracking Control Design of T-S Fuzzy Systems 65 
the MOP in (4.30) to seek a set of Pareto optimal solutions to achieve simultaneous 
minimization by nondominating sorting schemes [76–79]. 
Remark 4.6: (i) The weighted-sum optimization method is to convert an MOP 
to an SOP by emphasizing one optimal solution of weighted sum, that is, 
to minimize (wa w b ) for some weightings w ³ 0 and w ³ 0 with 1 + 2 1 2 
w1 +wz = 1 instead of directly minimizing (a b ). For example, by fol￾lowing a similar procedure in the proof of Theorem 4.2 with the weighted 
sum (w a +w b ) to replace (a b ) for all w ³ 0, w ³ 0, and w w+ = 1, 1 2 1 2 1 2 
the MOP for the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design can be 
solved by 
min w a +wb (W P, , ) Y ÎW 1 2 11 22 j (4.34) 
subject to (4.16) - (4.18) 
(ii) The weighted sum method in (4.34) provides an alternative solution for 
the MOP of the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design for fuzzy 
systems. The shortage of the weighed sum method for the MOP in (4.34) 
is that you need to solve all solutions for the MOP with different weight￾ings w and w with w ³ 0, w ³ 0, and w w = 1. The MOP by the 1 2 1 2 1 + 2 
weighted sum method in (4.34) can be solved directly with the help of 
LMI toolbox in MATLAB if the weightings w1 and w2 are given. When 
such a method is used to fnd multiple solutions of an MOP, it has to be 
applied with different weightings many times, hopefully fnding a differ￾ent solution at each computational run. However, the Pareto solutions for 
the MOP in (4.30), which is proposed in this study, can be obtained by 
the LMI-based MOEA in a single run. 
Remark 4.7: (i) Considering the optimal H2 tracking performance, the MOP 
(4.30) is reduced to the following SOP 
a = min a 
(W P Y ) 11 , 22 , , j b ÎWa (4.35) 
subject to (4.16) - (4.18) 
where Wa denotes the feasible set in which all elements of Wa must be 
satisfed with W > 0, P > 0, b > 0, and (4.16)–(4.18). When a = a, the 11 22 
corresponding b = b is denoted as the upper bound of b in the feasible 
region (see Figure 4.2). 
(ii) Considering the optimal robust H∞ tracking performance, the MOP in 
(4.30) is reduced to the following SOP 
b = min b (W P 11 22 , , , Yj a )ÎWb (4.36) 
subject to (4.16) - (4.18)  
 
 
66 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
where Wb denotes the feasible set in which all elements of Wb must be 
satisfed with W > 0, P > 0, a > 0, and (4.16)–(4.18). When b b = , 11 22 
the corresponding a = a is denoted as the upper bound of a in the fea￾sible region. 
* (iii) In general, the solutions (a* b ) of the MOP in (4.30) should be under 
the following constraint 
£ * £ * a a < a and b b < b (4.37) 
Remark 4.8: In contrast to the conventional EA algorithm to search one parameter 
for the SOPs in (4.31)–(4.33), we need to search the optimal parameters a* and b* 
simultaneously for the optimal MOP. In the search process, one parameter cannot 
dominate another parameter or it will violate simultaneous minimization. In this sit￾uation, the Pareto optimal solutions for the MOPs in (4.30) should be searched via 
an MOEA scheme through a nondominating search scheme in the following section. 
4.4 REVERSE-ORDER LMI-BASED MOEA APPROACH FOR 
MULTI-OBJECTIVE H2/H∞ TRACKING CONTROL DESIGN 
Based on the Pareto optimal solution properties that we mentioned in Section 4.1, 
the reverse-order LMI-based MOEA scheme is proposed to search for the optimal 
parameters a* and b*
 simultaneously to solve the MOP in (4.30) for fuzzy tracking 
control design [76–78]. For the property of the dominance for the MOP in (4.30), 1 1 1 2 2 2 consider two solutions (W P, , ) Y and (W P, , ) Y in W for two objective values 11 22 j 11 22 j 
(a b ) and (a b ) subject to the LMIs in (4.16)–(4.18), respectively. (a b ) is 1 1 2 2 1 1 
said to dominate ( ) a b if aa £ and bb £ , with at least one inequality being 2 2 1 2 1 2 
a strict inequality. In relation to the property of the Pareto optimal solution for the * * MOP in (4.30), a solution (W P, , ) Y* is the Pareto optimal solution of the MOP in 11 22 j ˘ ˘ ˘ (4.30) with respect to W if there does not exist another feasible solution ( , W P 11 22 , ) Yj ˘ ˘ * * such that objective values (a b ) dominate (a b ). The Pareto front for the 
MOP in (4.30) defned as * * * G ˙ {(a* b*
)( W P,, Y ) is the Pareto optimal solution 11 22 j 
of the MOP in (4.30), and ( * * ) is generated by ( * 
, * , )* a b W P Y subject to the LMIs 11 22 j 
in (4.16)–(4.18)}. 
An evolutionary algorithm is a stochastic search method based on natural 
selection and is also particularly suitable for solving the MOP in (4.30) due to 
its population-based nature, which allows a set of Pareto optimal solutions to 
be obtained in a single run. A number of MOEAs have been proposed to solve 
MOPs with simple algebraic constraints. In the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking 
control design problem, a reverse-order LMI-based MOEA scheme is proposed 
to search the optimal parameters a* and b*
 to solve the LMI-constrained MOP 
in (4.30) through a nondominating sorting scheme. If appropriate matrices W11 
* 
, 
P22 
*
, and Yj 
* are specifed to minimize both a and b in the MOP in (4.30) by the 
proposed LMI-based MOEA scheme, then the corresponding fuzzy control gains * * * are obtained as K = Y P for the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design. j j 11 
We will discuss some important steps for the reverse-order LMI-based MOEA  
 
 
 
 
 
Multi-Objective Tracking Control Design of T-S Fuzzy Systems 67 
and some characteristics of the Pareto optimal solutions of the MOP in (4.30) as 
follows: 
(1) Objective value encoding:
The objective values a and b are encoded into chromosomes Ck = (ak bk ).
The proposed MOEA approach uses decimal-valued objective values for
chromosome construction to avoid a long binary string and large search
space in the conventional genetic algorithm (GA).
Defnition 4.4: Each chromosome Ck has an individual (ak bk ) in terms of two
objective values, and a set of chromosomes is called a population. 
(2) Initial solution by the LMI method:
From the MOPs in (4.30) and (4.37), it is seen that the selection range of the 
Pareto front is within a a* a and b b* £ < £ < b . The traditional MOEA
methods select candidate individuals (a b ) from the selection region as
initial population. In the study, we need to impose the LMI constraints in
(4.16)–(4.18) into the traditional MOEA method. First, a number of initial
population Ck , k = 1,..., N (or chromosomes) will be generated from the
selection region. Then, in order to ensure some of these solutions will be
feasible for the MOP in (4.30), each initial solution will be checked by
the existence of the matrices W11, P22, and Yj
 in the LMIs in (4.16)–(4.18).
If not, these initial individuals have to be deleted and replaced by other
randomly selected feasible initial individuals so that the initial popula￾tions are all in the feasible set W for the MOP in (4.30). Note that the LMI
constraints in (4.16)–(4.18) create more restrictions on the searching of
feasible solutions than the traditional MOEA method. The LMI toolbox
in MATLAB can help these individuals (chromosomes) very effciently
check whether they satisfy the LMIs in (4.16)–(4.18). Therefore, the previ￾ous initialization scheme can help accelerate convergence speed.
(3) Nondominated sorting:
Since we want to minimize two parameters (a b ) simultaneously, one
parameter cannot dominate another one in the search process to guaran￾tee simultaneous minimization in the MOP in (4.30). Therefore, we could
only select the parameters through a nondominating sorting method in the
LMI-based MOEA search process. Before the selection step in the pro￾cess, all individuals of the population are assigned ranks based on the
property of dominance. All individuals are classifed into one category,
which is ranked in level (1 is the best level, 2 is the next-best level, and so
on). At the beginning, the frst nondominated set in the current population
is constituted based on the property of dominance, and each individual of
the frst nondominated set is classifed. Next, those classifed individuals
of the frst nondominated set are ignored temporarily in order to classify
the residual individuals of the population in the same way for the second
nondominated set. The sorting process continues until all individuals in
the population are ranked. In the following multi-objective optimization 
 
 
 
68 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
search process with a nondominating sorting scheme, the individuals with 
better ranks will have more copies than other individuals, which creates 
the elitist characteristic in the evolution algorithm and allows better con￾vergence to Pareto optimal solutions [2]. 
(4) Fitness assignment: 
Each individual is assigned a crowding distance to preserve uniformity of 
population. For a particular individual ( i a b ) with nondominated level j, i 
we frst fnd all other individuals (ak bk ), which are assigned a rank equal 
to nondominated level j, and individual distance is defned as the distance 
between two individuals (a b ) on either side of this individual (a b ) 
along each objective. Then, the crowding distance of individual (a b ) is 
k k i i 
i i 
calculated as the sum of individual distances corresponding to each objective. 
If the individual ( i a b ) is a boundary individual, the crowding distance is i 
assigned an infnite value. After performing selection, those individuals with 
higher crowding distances have more survivability because those individuals 
with higher value make up the uniform distribution of the population. 
(5) Crossover and mutation: 
In this study, the basic mechanisms of the crossover and mutation opera￾tors are described in [76, 77]. After generating offspring population, they 
need to be checked by the three LMIs in (4.16)–(4.18) to fnd whether 
W11 > 0, P22 > 0, and Yj
 so that these offspring populations are feasible. 
Based on this analysis, a detailed design procedure of the proposed LMI-based 
MOEA approach for the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design is as follows. 
Design procedure: 
Step 1: Select membership functions, construct fuzzy plant rules in (4.1), and 
specify the desired reference model in (4.3). 
Step 2: Set the selection range a a* a and b b* £ < £ < b , the maximum 
number M of generations, total population size L , crossover ratio, and 
mutation ratio for the MOEA. 
Step 3: Initialize a number of random individual ( i a b ) within the selection i 
range, and take those individuals (a b ) that satisfy the LMI constraints i i 
in (4.16)–(4.18) as the initial population. 
Step 4: Sort the current population into different fronts by a nondominating 
sorting scheme, and assign a crowding distance to each individual. 
Step 5: Perform the selection step to select half the size of the current popula￾tion as the parent population based on rank and crowding distance. 
Step 6: Perform the crossover and mutation operators by the MOEA, and check the 
three LMIs in (4.16)–(4.18) to construct feasible offspring for the MOP in (4.30). 
Step 7: Combine the parent population with the offspring, do steps 4 and 5, and 
select individuals according to their ranks and crowding distances until the 
population size reaches the total population size. A new generation is cre￾ated for optimization search after doing step 7. 
Step 8: Repeat steps 6 and 7 until the maximum generation M is reached.

When the previous LMI-based MOEA processing is fnished, the Pareto front (a* b* ) * * * is obtained, and the corresponding set of Pareto optimal solutions (W P, , ) Y will 11 22 j * * * * -1 be also obtained. Then the corresponding fuzzy control gains K = Y P = Y W are j j 11 j 11 
obtained for the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design. 
The total computational complexity of the proposed LMI-based MOEA scheme 
is analyzed as follows: the computational complexity of solving the LMIs in (4.16)– 2 2 (4.18) is about the other O( 2 ( +1 2 )/ ) Î ´ l n n , where 2n is the order of P R nn , 
and l is the number of fuzzy rules. The computational complexity of the MOEA 
scheme is about the order O(2ML2 ), where L is the size of population, and M is 
the maximum number of generation of the MOEA scheme. Thus, the total compu￾tational complexity of the proposed LMI-based MOEA scheme is about the order 22 2 O(n l ML ).

To use the fuzzy control approach, we suppose that x1
, x2, x3, and x4 are all availa￾ble through the optical encoder attached on the robot. In this example, angular posi￾tions q1
, q2 are constrained within [-p / 2 ,/ p 2]. To minimize the design complexity,
we use the following nine fuzzy if-then rules to construct the T-S fuzzy model for the 
systems in (4.39): 
Rule 1: If x is about -p / 2 and x is about -p / 2, then x A ˆ = x B + u E+ w. 1 3 1 1 
Rule 2: If x is about -p / 2 and x is about 0, then x A ˆ = x B + u E+ w. 1 3 2 2

of the three Pareto optimal solutions and the conventional solution of the SOP in (4.33) 
for the conventional mixed H2/H∞ tracking control design are given in Table 4.1. Based

the three Pareto optimal solutions, we give a prescribed H∞ disturbance attenuation level 
b = 0 2436 . , which is equal to one of the optimal H∞ solutions. After solving the SOP in 
(4.33), we obtain a0 = 0.9417 in Table 4.1. We can easily see that the tracking error per￾formance in Pareto solution 1 is the smallest in Table 4.1. Since Pareto solution 2 is close to 
the optimal H∞ solution, it has the worst tracking error performance from the H2 tracking 
performance perspective. Since Pareto solution 3 has a compromise between H2 optimal 
tracking and optimal H∞ disturbance rejection, it has smaller tracking error performance

4.6 CONCLUSION 
This chapter studied the multi-objective robust fuzzy tracking control design of 
Takagi and Sugeno fuzzy systems. The purposes of this chapter are the following: 
(1) Based on the T-S fuzzy model, we formulated the multi-objective robust fuzzy 
tracking control design problem of nonlinear dynamic systems as an MOP with two 
conficting objectives, H2 tracking performance and robust H∞ tracking performance, 
which can be optimized simultaneously. At present, researchers have focused more 
attention on the MOP of algebraic systems, and most control engineers have paid 
more attention to conventional mixed H2/H∞ control design problems. This chapter 
introduced an effcient method to solve the MOP for the optimal H2/H∞ tracking con￾trol design of nonlinear dynamic systems. (2) By the proposed indirect technique and 
linear matrix inequality scheme, the multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design 
problem can be transformed into an equivalent LMI-constrained MOP. Therefore, the 
multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design problem can be effciently solved in a 
single run by way of the proposed LMI-based MOEA search method with the help of 
the LMI toolbox in MATLAB and the advantage of a nondominating sorting scheme 
for the Pareto optimal solutions. A simulation example of a two-link robot is given to 
illustrate the design procedure and to confrm the robust tracking performance of the 
proposed multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking control design. For more practical applica￾tions, multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy observer-based tracking control design or a more 
general multi-objective control design problem (i.e., a MOP with three or four design 
objectives) are given in the following chapters. DOI: 10.1201/9781003362142-7 75

5.1 INTRODUCTION 
As far as the national military is concerned, missile guidance to hit a target is quite 
important. Missile guidance has always been a very popular topic in the aerospace 
feld and military affairs. The control principles of missile guidance are well known 
to control engineers. Many guidance controls have been discussed in [91–93], and 
many guidance technologies have been developed to improve guidance control per￾formance and to accommodate environmental disturbances. These guidance tech￾niques are mainly based on classical control theory. Various guidance laws have been 
exploited with different control concepts over the years [92]. Currently, most popular 
terminal guidance laws are based on linear quadratic regulatory (LQR) theory [94], 
linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) theory [95], linear exponential Gaussian theory, 
sliding mode theory [96–98], H∞ robust theory, and fuzzy logic control theory [84, 
99–102]. Because the dynamic system can represent relative motion between a mis￾sile and target, which is highly nonlinear and uncertain due to unmodeled dynamics 
and parameter perturbations resulting from missile modeling, it is more appealing to 
design a guidance law to achieve multi-objective (MO) H2/H∞ guidance performance 
to make the missile optimally track the target and attenuate the effect of continuous 
Wiener noise, discontinuous Poisson jump noise, and external disturbance simultane￾ously. Since it is still very diffcult to solve the MO H2/H∞ guidance problem directly, 
in this chapter, an equivalent indirect MO H2/H∞ guidance problem is proposed by 
minimizing the upper bounds of H2 and H∞ performance simultaneously. However, it 
is not easy to effciently solve the complex MO H2/H∞ guidance problem because we 
need to solve a nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobin inequality–constrained MO H2/H∞ guid￾ance problem. Unfortunately, at present, there still exists no good method to solve 
such HJI-constrained MO H2/H∞ guidance problems for nonlinear stochastic missile 
guidance systems. Therefore, in this chapter, using this fuzzy interpolation approach, 
an HJI-constrained MO H2/H∞ guidance strategy for missile guidance design can be  
r

transformed into a linear matrix inequality–constrained MO H2/H∞ guidance prob￾lem. Then a reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA is also developed to solve the 
MO H2/H∞ guidance control design problem through a nondominated sorting scheme 
with the help of the MATLAB LMI toolbox. On the whole, the H2/H∞ guidance
control design problem does not have a unique solution, but a set of Pareto optimal 
solutions could be obtained by the proposed reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA, 
from which the designer could select one according to their own preference. Finally, 
a simulation example is given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MO H2/H∞ 
guidance control strategy of the stochastic missile guidance system with intrinsic 
continuous and discontinuous random fuctuation as well as external distance.

Remark 5.1: When r ® 0, Vj ® 0, and Vq

will hit the target in the head-on condition. Among three relative velocities, Vr,

Vj, and Vq, only the relative velocity along to the line of sight (LOS) (i.e., Vr) could

decrease the relative distance between missile and target. Therefore, it can be 
decreased to zero. 
In real situations, the missile dynamic system in (5.1) should be modifed as 
follows:

2 (5.4) + å G x t d k ( ( )) N t k () k=1 
where x x F, H, and Gk : °n ® °n are nonlinear Borel measurable continuous func￾tions, which are satisfed with local Lipschitz continuity. Wiener noise W t() is a 
continuous but nondifferentiable stochastic process with dW t ( ) : = n( ) td t, and
H x( (t d )) W t( ) denotes the effect of continuous stochastic intrinsic noise. N t( ) is a

then E d {[ N t( )][dW t( )]} = 0. 
Some important properties of the Wiener process W t() and Poisson jump process 
N t( ) are given as follows: (1) E W{ (t)} = { ( )} { ( ) ( )} = d k E dW t = 0, (2) E dW t dW t t, 
(3) E dN t k { ( )} = ldt, (4) E d{ ( N t)} dt = 0.

5.3 MULTI-OBJECTIVE H2/H∞ GUIDANCE CONTROL DESIGN 
FOR NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC MISSILE SYSTEMS 
In the nonlinear stochastic missile guidance system in (5.4), a good guidance law u t() 
must guarantee a decreasing relative distance r t( ) and at the same time keep the pitch 
and yaw LOS rates Vt q ( ) as small as possible, that is, in the head-on condi- j ( ) and Vt 
tion. Therefore, our frst design objective is to design the guidance command u t( ) so 
that the controlled variable h() = r t V t V ( ), (t)]T t [ ( ), is reduced to as close to zero as j q 
possible with minimal control effort. In this situation, the frst design objective is to 
specify u t( ) to minimize the following H2 guidance performance 
tf T T Ju = E [ ( ) h( ) + u t Ru t dt 1 () {ò0 h t Qt ( ) ( )] } (5.6) Multi-Objective Missile Guidance Control 79 
However, the H2 guidance control in (5.6) could not treat the uncertain external dis￾turbance v t( ); that is, it assumes v t() = 0. Hence, the following H guidance per￾formance is given as the second design objective to effciently attenuate the effect 
of external disturbance v t( ) on guidance performance with the initial condition 
x( ) 0 ˙ x0 ¹ 0: 
∞ 
tf T E {[ ò h ( )t Q t h( )]dt -V x( )} 0 0 J u() = (5.7) t 2 f T E v {[ ()() t v t d]} t ò0 
That is, the second design objective is to specify u t( ) to minimize the effect of exter￾nal disturbance on the missile guidance simultaneously. 
Since the simultaneous minimization of both H2 guidance performance in (5.6) 
and H guidance performance in (5.7) are more appealing for guidance control ∞ 
design, the following MO H2/H∞ guidance control design is formulated as follows: 
min( 1 ( ), ( 2 J u Ju )) u t() (5.8) 
s.t.( . 5 4) 
where min( J u( ),( Ju )) means to specify ut ( ) to minimize J u( ) and J u( ) at the 1 2 1 2 u t( )
same time. The vector ( (1 ), 2 J u Ju ( )) is called the objective vector of ut ( ). As a whole, 
the solution of the MO H2/H∞ guidance problem is not unique. There exist a set of 
Pareto optimal solutions in the Pareto optimal sense. 
In general, it is very diffcult to solve the MO H2/H∞ guidance problem in (5.8) 
directly. Consequently, we propose an indirect method to minimize their upper 
bounds simultaneously as follows: 
min(a b,) u t() (5.9) 
subject to (5.4), (1 ) £ a and 2 Ju Ju ( ) £ b 
that is, we specify guidance law u t( ) to minimize the upper bounds a and b simul￾taneously. Based on the following lemma, we will prove the MO H2/H∞ guidance 
controls in (5.8) and (5.9) are equivalent when Pareto optimal solutions are achieved. 
Lemma 5.2: The MO H2/H∞ guidance problems in (5.8) and (5.9) are equivalent 
when Pareto optimal solutions of these two MO H2/H∞ optimal guidance problems * * * * are achieved, that is, ( , 1 2 JJ )( = a b, ) .
Proof: Please refer to Appendix 5.8.1. 
Lemma 5.2 provides an indirect method to solve the MO H2/H∞ guidance prob￾lems of the nonlinear stochastic missile guidance system in (5.4). Then, we get the 
following results. 
Theorem 5.1: The MO H2/H∞ guidance problem in (5.9) can be solved by the 
following HJI-constrained MO problem:

On the whole, it is almost impossible to solve a closed-form guidance law u t() 
from the MO H2/H∞ guidance problem in (5.10) because HJIs G( ) 1 £ 0 and G( ) 2 £ 0 
are nonlinear partial differential Hamilton Jacobi inequalities. At present, there is 
still no good method to solve HJIs of G( ) 1 and G( ) 2 for the MO H2/H∞ guidance 
problem in (5.10). Thus, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy interpolation method is employed 
to simplify these HJIs for the control design procedure of the MO H2/H∞ guidance 
problem in (5.10). 
5.4 REVERSE-ORDER LMI-BASED MOEA APPROACH FOR 
MULTI-OBJECTIVE H2/H∞ TRACKING CONTROL DESIGN 
The MO H2/H∞ guidance law of the nonlinear stochastic missile system in (5.4) 
needs to solve the HJI-constrained MO H2/H∞ guidance problem in (5.10), where 
the solutions of HJIs are very diffcult to obtain even with numerical methods. 
To overcome this HJI-constrained MO H2/H∞ guidance problem in (5.10), a T-S 
fuzzy interpolation method is employed to approximate the nonlinear stochastic 
missile guidance system in (5.4) by interpolating several locally linearized sys￾tems via the fuzzy bases. This fuzzifed linear system is described by a group 
of if-then rules and is employed to deal with the MO H2/H guidance control ∞ 
problem. 
The ith rule of the T-S fuzzy model for the nonlinear stochastic missile guidance 
system in (5.4) is described by: 
Plant Rule i : 
If z t( ) is F , and, ...,and z ( )t is F (5.11) 1 i1 g ig 
dx t = (Ai () xt () + Bu() () t + Dvt ) dt
Then 2 
+ H x t dWt +å () () G x() t dN t( ) i ik k 
k=1 
where Fij is the fuzzy set. Ai
, Hi
, and Gi
 are the locally linearized system matri￾ces of F x(( t )), H x(( t )), and G x(( t)) at the corresponding fuzzy set, respectively. 
z t( ),...., z t( ) are the premise variables, F z( ) is the membership grade of z t( ) in Fij, 1 g ij j j  
 
 )
Multi-Objective Missile Guidance Control 81 
and h z i(( t )) is the i th interpolation function with i = 12 , ,..., l . The overall fuzzy system
in (5.11) can be inferred as follows [10]: 
l 
dx t() = å h z t A x t () + Dv t dt i(( ))[( i () + But ( )) i=1 (5.12) 2 
+ H x () G x t dN t i ( )t dWt +å ik () k ( )] k=1

F zt , h () = i zt , and l () 1 g ( )] i ij( (j )) i z l åi=1 h z i j=1 å ui( (z t)) 
i=1 
h z( (t)) = 1, for i = 1 2, ,...,l. 
i i( ( )) ³ 0, and åi
l 
=1 i It is natural to assume u z( (t )) ³ 0, h z t h z( (t )) = 1, for i = 1 2, ,...,l. 
The physical meaning of the stochastic fuzzy model in (5.12) is that the locally 
linearized stochastic systems in (5.11) at a different fuzzy set Fij are interpolated 
piecewise by interpolation function h z( (t)) to approximate the original nonlinear i 
stochastic missile guidance system in (5.4). Note that the identifcations of Ai
, Hi
, 
and Gi
, can be obtained by the fuzzy system identifcation method in the MATLAB 
toolbox. Consequently, the nonlinear stochastic missile guidance system in (5.4) 
could be represented by 
l 
dx t() = å h z t ( )) i(( ))[(A x t i () + Bu t() + Dv t dt i=1 
2 
+ H x() td Wt () + å G x( )td ) Nt ( )] + DF x(( t)) (5.13) i ik k k=1 
2 
+D ( ( )) () + å DG xt dNk H x t dW t ( ( )) ( )t k=1 
where DF x( (t )), DH x( (t )), and DG x(( t )), denote the fuzzy approximation error
between the stochastic missile guidance system in (5.4) and the T-S fuzzy interpola￾tion system in (5.12) with regard to the system in (5.13). 
The following fuzzy guidance law is employed to deal with the MO H2/H∞ missile 
guidance problem: 
Guidance Law Rule i : 
If z t() is F , and, ...,and z (t)is F (5.14) 1 i1 g ig 
Then u( )t = i K xt ( ), for i = 1,...,l 
Then, the overall fuzzy guidance law can be expressed as 
l 
u t() = å h z(( t K)) x t() (5.15) i i i=1  
 
+
82 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
where h z(( t)) is defned in (5.12), and K , i = 1,...,l are the fuzzy control parameters. i i 
Substituting (5.15) into (5.13), we get the closed-loop system of the missile guidance 
system as: 
l l 
dx t () = ååh ( (zt )) h z( (t))[((A + BK ) ( x t) i j i j 
i=1 j=1

2 
+ DF(xt ( )) + DH x( ( )t d) W t( ) + å DG x( ( )td ) N t( ) k k k=1 
Suppose there exist some positive scalars r
1, r2, and r3 such that the fuzzy approxima￾tion errors are bounded as follows: 
DF x( (t)) £ r
1 x t( ) 2 2 
DH x( (t)) £ r2 x t( ) 2 2 (5.17)
DG x t 1 ( ( )) £ r31 x t( ) 2 2 
DG x( ( )t ) £ r32 x t( ) 2 2 2 
Based on this analysis, the MO H2/H∞ guidance problem becomes how to specify 
fuzzy guidance law in (5.15) or Ki , i = 1,...,l for the missile guidance system in 
(5.13) so that the MO H2/H∞ guidance problem in (5.10) could be solved for Ki , 
i = 1,...,l in (5.15); that is, with the fuzzy missile system in (5.13) and fuzzy guid￾ance law (5.15), the MO H2/H∞ guidance problem in (5.10) in Theorem 5.1 could be 
simplifed signifcantly and solved easily.

5.5 MO H2/H∞ GUIDANCE CONTROL OF NONLINEAR 
STOCHASTIC MISSILE SYSTEM DESIGN VIA 
REVERSE-ORDER LMI-CONSTRAINED MOEA 
It is not easy to solve the MOP in Theorem 2 directly. In this section, a reverse-order 
LMI-constrained MOEA search is developed to help us solve the MOP in Theorem 
5.2 iteratively. 
The reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA procedure for MO fuzzy guidance 
controlled design: 
* * Step 1: Set the feasible range [, a a] [ ´ b ,] b for the feasible objective vectors
( , a b ), the maximum number of generations Ng, the total population size Np, 
the crossover ratio Nc, and the mutation ratio Nm in the LMI-constrained 
MOEA. 
Step 2: Generate a population such that all chromosomes (solutions) ( , a b ) in 
the population are within the feasible range, that is, those chromosomes 
( , a b ) that satisfy the LMI constraints in (5.23)–(5.25), as the initial popula￾tion and set the iteration index k = 1. 
Step 3: Perform crossover and mutation operations in evolution algorithm to 
2Np number feasible solutions for the population, and examine three LMIs 
(5.23)–(5.25) to construct feasible solutions for the MOP in (5.22). 
Step 4: Select Np solutions based on the survival of the fttest from the 2Np feasi￾ble solutions in Step 3 through the nondominated sorting method. Sort the cur￾rent population into different fronts and combine the parent population with 
solution, and perform Step 3 to select chromosomes according to their rank 
and ftness value until the population size reaches the total population size. 
Step 5: Set the iteration index kk =+ 1 and repeat Steps 3, 4, and 5 until the
maximum number of generations is reached. It is worth mentioning that the 
Pareto form in the last generation is the optimal Pareto front. 
Step 6: If the LMIs in (5.23)–(5.25) have a P > 0, then the nonlinear stochas￾tic missile guidance system in (5.16) with K = Z P (i = 1 2, ,...,l) would be i i 
stable, and the MO H2/H∞ missile guidance problem in (5.4) can be solved 
with J1 = a*
 and J2 = b*
 simultaneously.

5.6 SIMULATION EXAMPLE AND RESULT 
The following example is given to verify the performance of the proposed fuzzy 
nonlinear MO H2/H∞ missile guidance law. The maneuvering strategies of the target 
in the 3-D model [92] are utilized as external disturbance v t( ) to confrm the tracking 
performance and the robustness of the fuzzy MO H2/H∞ missile guidance laws; that 
is, for the external disturbance v t( ), we used step target:

where WT is the target’s navigation gain, which we set as a random value within 
0–4G in our simulation. To demonstrate the tracking performance robustness of the 
proposed method, the following scenarios are considered in the missile guidance 
system in (5.1): 
Target is toward to missile (Vr < 0): r = 9 km, j = p 4, q p = 3, Vr = -500m s/ , 
Vj = 200m s/ , Vq = 150 m s/ . 
Applying the T-S fuzzy approach considering the approximation error, the non￾linear stochastic missile guidance system in (5.4) can be rewritten as (5.16). The 
upper bounds of the fuzzy approximation errors in (5.17) are also known to be -6 -4 -5 r = 5 3101. ´10 , r = 5 6970. ´10 , and r = 7 5638. ´10 . We used 12 rules based 1 2 3 
on the premise variables z t() () = ( ( z t),z t , ( zt )) = [, r V , ] V = [ ( x txtx ), ( ), (t)] to 1 2 3 j q 1 5 6

The operation points of x t( ), x t( ), and x t( ) are respectively given at: x( ) 1 = 4723, 1 5 6 1 ( ) 2 ( ) 3 ( ) 1 ( ) 2 ( ) 1 ( ) 2 x = 7000, x = 9000, x = 187 4. , x = 427.8, x = -231.6, and x = 297 4. , 1 1 5 5 6 6 -5 -5 -5 and we selected the weighting matrices Q R = = diag(10 ,10 ,10 ). By solving 
the MO H2/H∞ missile guidance problem in (5.19)–(5.22), we can get L and Zi
, with - i = 1 2, ,...,12. Therefore, we can obtain K = Z L 1
, where N = 30, iteration num- i i p 
ber k = 50, crossover ratio Nc = 0 9. , and mutation ratio Nm = 0 1. . Once the iteration 
number k = 50 is achieved, the Pareto front for the Pareto optimal solutions of the 
MOP for the nonlinear stochastic missile guidance system in (5.4) can be obtained 
as given in Figure 5.2. 
We choose three Pareto optimal solutions, A, B, and C, in Table 5.1 from Figure 5.2 
to illustrate how to select the preferable solution. In Figure 5.2, Pareto optimal solution 
A has the best J2 performance among the three Pareto optimal solutions so that the tra￾jectory of Pareto optimal solution A has the minimum perturbation but the maximum J1 
performance. However, for Pareto optimal solution C, its trajectory has the maximum 
perturbation among the three Pareto optimal solutions because it has the minimum J1 
performance. The J1 performance of Pareto solution B is between those of Pareto solu￾tion A and Pareto solution C. The state trajectories of x t() = x t x t( )˜x t T [ ( ), ( )] of 1 2 6 
Pareto optimal solutions A, B, and C of the MO H2/H∞ guidance control law are shown 
in Figures 5.3–5.6 with intrinsic continuous random fuctuation caused by the Wiener 
process in Figure 5.6 and intrinsic discontinuous fuctuations caused by the Poisson 86 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

A is the smoothest one among the three solutions. Hence, J1 performance had a more 
signifcant effect than J2 performance. It is obvious that Pareto optimal solution A is 
the preferable guidance control solution of the three Pareto optimal solutions because 
Pareto solution A is a compromise solution in the MO H2/H∞ missile guidance prob￾lem of the nonlinear stochastic missile guidance system. However, these three chosen 
Pareto optimal solutions have satisfactory regulation results to achieve the desired 
steady states of the missile guidance system in spite of intrinsic continuous and dis￾continuous random fuctuation and external disturbance.

5.8 APPENDIX 
5.8.1 Proof of Lemma 5.2 
The proof of Lemma 5.2 is straightforward. One only needs to prove that both 
inequality constraints in the MO problem in (5.9) become equality constraints for 
Pareto optimal solutions. We will show this by contradiction. Given a 3-tuple Pareto * * * optimal solution (( ut ),a b, )of the MO problem in (5.9), we assume that either
of the inequalities in (5.9) remains a strict inequality at the Pareto optimal solution. 
Without loss of generality, suppose that * * J u( (t )) £ a* 
1 . As a result, there exists a1 
< * * * * * such that a1 a 1 and J u( (t )) £ a . Now, for the same ut a b ) 1 ( ), the solution ( , 1 
dominates the Pareto optimal solution ( , * * a b ) , leading to a contradiction. This
implies that both inequality constraints in problem (5.9) indeed become equality 
for constraint-optimal solutions. Thus, the MOP in (5.9) is equivalent to the MOP 
described in (5.8).

6 Multi-Objective Control 
Design of Nonlinear 
Mean-Field Stochastic 
Jump-Diffusion Systems 
6.1 INTRODUCTION 
The mean-feld stochastic system was frst proposed by M. Kac [103] to study the 
stochastic model for the Vlasov equation of plasma. The mean-feld theory was 
proposed to describe collective behaviors resulting from individuals’ mutual inter￾action in various physical and sociological dynamic systems. With the development 
of stochastic control and flter theories [11, 15, 36, 34, 104–123], the mean-feld sto￾chastic system has become an active research feld [105–108]. One main feature of 
the mean-feld stochastic system is that the mean of the system state (the mean term) 
Ext appears in its system dynamics. Thus, designing a controller for the mean-feld 
stochastic system is more diffcult than doing so for the classical one. In the past 
ten years, most researchers have focused on the optimal H2 control design and opti￾mal H∞ robust control design for linear mean-feld stochastic systems [109–111]. 
However, in practical applications, H2 and H∞ control performances are usually in 
partial confict with each other. To balance the confict between H2 and H∞ control 
performance, the multi-objective H2/H∞ control design has emerged [15, 112–114]. 
Unlike the mixed H2/H∞ control design that only minimizes H2 performance under 
the constraint of a prescribed H∞ performance [11, 34, 36, 115–117], the multi￾objective H2/H∞ control design is defned as how to design a controlled input ut 
to concurrently minimize H2 and H∞ performance in the Pareto optimal sense for 
a dynamic system and try to completely describe the tradeoff between H2 and H∞ 
performance. 
There are three main diffculties in solving the multi-objective H2/H∞ control prob￾lem for nonlinear mean-feld stochastic jump diffusion (MFSJD) systems, as follows. 
(I) In general, for a multi-objective nonlinear H2/H∞ control design, we always 
need to solve Hamilton-Jacobi inequalities. However, for the nonlinear 
MFSJD system, its HJIs are diffcult to derive. 
(II) Owing to the fact that both the mean term Ext and Poisson jump processes 
appear in the system dynamic equation, the stability criterion of the non￾linear MFSJD system needs to be derived. 
(III) Multi-Objective H2/H∞ control design problems are diffcult to solve directly 
and always need to achieve a solution via multi-objective evolutionary Nonlinear Mean-Field Stochastic Jump-Diffusion Systems 97 
algorithm search methods. However, the existing linear matrix inequality– 
constrained MOEAs always have higher computational loads for nonlinear 
MFSJD systems. 
For issue (I), the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is employed to overcome it. The 
T-S fuzzy interpolation method had been widely used in nonlinear control and flter 
design problems [104, 116, 118–121]. Based on it, one can employ a set of locally 
linear MFSJD systems to approximate a nonlinear MFSJD system. Thus, the HJIs 
of the nonlinear MFSJD systems can be replaced by a set of LMIs, and the corre￾sponding multi-objective H2/H∞ control design problem is transformed into an LMI￾constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Even though the T-S fuzzy model 
effciently refects the behavior of the nonlinear MFSJD system, we also consider 
the effects of approximation errors of the T-S model on the multi-objective H2/H∞ 
control design because they indeed affect the stability and control performance of 
the nonlinear MFSJD system. 
For issue (II), we will propose suffcient conditions for the stability of the non￾linear fuzzy MFSJD systems in the mean square sense by decoupling the MFSJD 
system into two orthogonal subsystems: the mean subsystem of Ext and the variation 
subsystem of x˜ = x - Ex . Then, we have the augmented system with system state t t t 
X = x˜
T ExT T [ , ] . Because the augmented system is also a stochastic jump diffusion t t t 
system, the Itô-Lévy formula can be applied to it. We can derive the stability criterion 
for the MFSJD system in the mean square sense. 
For issue (III), an indirect method is proposed to solve the multi-objective 
H2/H∞ control design for MFSJD systems by simultaneously minimizing the upper 
bound vectors ( , a b ) of the H2 and H∞ performance in the Pareto optimal sense. By 
applying the proposed indirect method, the multi-objective H2/H∞ control problem 
can be transformed into an LMI-constrained MOP. Therefore, the multi-objective 
H2/H∞ control for MFSJD systems becomes an issue of how to specify a set of 
control gains to concurrently minimize ( , a b ) subject to a set of LMI constraints in 
the Pareto optimal sense. For solving the LMI-constrained MOP, we usually intro￾duce the LMI-constrained MOEA search method in [6, 11, 122, 123]. The LMI￾constrained MOEA searches for the Pareto front of the multi-objective H2/H∞ con￾trol design for the nonlinear MFSJD systems via the evolutionary algorithm, non￾dominated sorting, and elitist selection operator. By concurrently decreasing the 
upper bound vectors ( , a b ) in the nondominating sense, the Pareto optimal solution 
set of the multi-objective H2/H∞ control for the nonlinear MFSJD system can be 
approached indirectly. As long as the Pareto front is obtained, the multi-objective 
H2/H∞ control problem for the MFSJD system can be also solved because each 
upper bound vector ( , a b ) of the Pareto front corresponds to a group of control 
gains, guaranteeing that the H2 and H∞ control performance ( , a b ) is minimized 
simultaneously. However, the existing LMI-constrained MOEAs mean a higher 
computational load. To decrease the computational load and improve the compu￾tational effciency, we proposed the front-squeezing LMI-constrained MOEA. The 
front-squeezing LMI-constrained MOEA concurrently employs the vice front and 
current parent front to narrow the search region down from two sides of the feasible 
and infeasible regions. 98 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

In this chapter, two main objectives are as follows: frst, we achieve a multi-objective 
H2/H∞ fuzzy control design for nonlinear MFSJD systems. It can completely describe 
the tradeoff between the H2 and H∞ control performance. Thus, the optimal H2 con￾trol design and optimal H∞ robust control design for a nonlinear MFSJD system can 
be accomplished simultaneously, and second, a novel reverse-order LMI-constrained 
MOEA called a front-squeezing LMI-constrained MOEA is proposed to effciently 
solve the MOP. Compared with the LMI-constrained MOEA in [11], it can reduce 
the computational load by more than half and has better performance in searching 
the Pareto front and Pareto optimal solutions of the multi-objective H2/H∞ control 
design for nonlinear MFSJD systems. Once the Pareto front is obtained, the designer 
can select a fuzzy controller from the Pareto optimal solution set according to their 
own preference.

Without loss of generality, the nonlinear MFSJD system in (6.1) has the following 
two properties: frst, the system states of the nonlinear MFSJD system in (6.1) are x available; second, the origin of ˜n is an equilibrium point of interest in the given 
nonlinear MFSJD system. If the equilibrium point of interest in the nonlinear MFSJD 
system is not at the origin point, then the designer can shift it to the origin by chang￾ing variables. 
The ith rule of the T-S fuzzy model for approximating the nonlinear MFSJD sys￾tem in (6.1) is described by 
If x ( )t is G and x ( )t is G ,...,x ( )t is G , 1 i,1 2 i,2 g i,1

The overall nonlinear fuzzy MFSJD system in (6.2) can be inferred as follows:

The physical meaning of the fuzzy model in (6.3) is that the locally linearized 
MFSJD systems in (6.2) at different operation points associated with a different 
fuzzy set G are interpolated piecewise via the fuzzy weighting basis { ( h x )}l to i k, i t i=1

Even though the T-S fuzzy model effciently refects the system behavior, we still 
need to consider the effects of approximation errors of the T-S model because they 
indeed affect the stability and control performance of the nonlinear MFSJD system. 
After counting the effects of approximation errors of the T-S fuzzy interpolation 
method and setting the control input to be ut in (6.5), we can represent (6.1) as 
follows:

where the functions Df , Dg, Dh , Ds r , and DTq are used to denote the T-S fuzzy 
approximation errors in the terms f ,h, g, s r , and Tq , respectively. 
Assumption 6.1: Assume the fuzzy approximation errors in (6.7) of the nonlinear 
MFSJD system in (6.1) are bounded in quadratic form for all t > 0, that is,

the same approximation accuracy, which one would be better. To respond to the prob￾lem, we only need to examine their domination relation between Pareto fronts P* of front 
S and P˝ * 
front of ˛S. More precisely, for a given region U defned on the objective space, 
if P* completely dominates P˝* 
front , we say model S is better than model S
˛ in the front 
given region U. In this chapter, the prior concern is the Pareto front and Pareto opti￾mal solutions of the LMI-constrained MOP in (6.22) with LMI constraints in (6.24)– 
(6.28) in the sequel, and they are highly dependent on the chosen T-S fuzzy model 
and its approximation error. Thus, the proposed method may be sensitive to the T-S 
fuzzy model. In addition, since the Pareto front and Pareto optimal solutions of multi￾objective H2/H∞ control design problems are diffcult to obtain through direct calcu￾lation, it is hard to give a theorem to predict which T-S fuzzy model would be better. 
Remark 6.2: In recent years, the tensor product (TP) model has also been pro￾posed for approximating nonlinear dynamic model and replacing HJIs with a set of 
LMIs [124–126]. In this chapter, the proposed multi-objective H2/H∞ control design 
method can be used not only in T-S fuzzy model but also in TP model. 
6.2.2 H2 and H∞ PerformanCe of mfsjd sysTems 
To process the multi-objective H2/H∞ control design for MFSJD system, we give the 
following defnitions. 
The H performance J u( ) indicates the value of the system quadratic cost 2 2 t 
function. 
Defnition 6.1([111]): For a given MFSJD system with the external disturbance 
v t() = 0, its H2 performance J u( ) is defned as follows: 2 t

Defnition 6.2 ([127, 128]): For a given mean-feld stochastic system with x0 = 0, the 
H∞ performance J u( ) of the given mean-feld stochastic system is defned as follows: ¥ t

The H∞ performance J u ¥ t ( ) can be regarded as the worst-case effect from the 2 ( v exogenous disturbance signal v Î L ˜ ˜; ˜ , MEx u , and Eu . We need n ) on Mx , ˜ t F + t t t t 
to eliminate the effects of initial energy, too (i.e., the energy V Xt ( ), which is caused 
by initial state X0 ). Thus, if the effect of initial condition is considered, the defnition 
of the H∞ performance needs to be modifed as follows: 
J u() = ¥ t

6.3 STABILITY ANALYSIS OF NONLINEAR FUZZY MFSJD SYSTEMS 
Stability is the most important concept in studying the stochastic dynamic system. To 
treat the state feedback control problem for the nonlinear MFSJD system in (6.1), we 
need to defne the stabilization for a stochastic system frst. 
Defnition 6.3 ([44, 49]): Suppose xeq = 0 is an equilibrium point of interest in the 
following nonlinear MFSJD system: 
dx = fx ,Ex ) +h(, )] + å 
m 
s ( , x Ex dW ( )r [( x Exu dt ) t t t t t t r t t t r =1 (6.11)

If there exist some positive constants C1 and C2 such that the following inequality 
holds: 
{ 2
E x( )t } £ C1exp(-C t2 ) (6.12) 2 
then the nonlinear MFSJD system in (6.11) is said to be exponentially mean square 
stable (i.e., exponentially stable in the mean square sense). 
To derive the suffcient condition for the stability of nonlinear fuzzy MFSJD sys￾tems in the mean square sense, we introduce the decoupled method that could decou￾ple the MFSJD system into two orthogonal subsystems in the mean-square sense: a 
mean subsystem of Ex and a variation subsystem of x˜ = x - Ex . t t t t 
Remark 6.3: Since x = (x - Ex ) + Ex for all t > 0, we have E xt { 2
} = t t t t 2 
Ex {( - Ex ) + Ex 2

T T + (Ext ) ( T Ext )} for all t > 0 and (ii) E x{˜ Ex } = E E{ x x˜ } = 0 for all t > 0. Based on t t t t 
(ii), we fnd that x˜t

then the fuzzy control input ut in (6.5) stabilizes the nonlinear fuzzy MFSJD system

Proof: Please refer to Appendix 6.8.1. 
Remark 6.4: The Lyapunov stability criterion is widely used to analyze the stability 
properties of dynamic systems [44, 49]. Theorem 6.1 can be regarded as the Lyapunov 
stability criterion of a nonlinear MFSJD system in the mean-square sense. Suppose the 
nonlinear MFSJD system in (6.1) can be approximated by the nonlinear fuzzy MFSJD T T T T system in (6.7). Based on the fact that E x{ { x } = E x x ˜˜ + (Ex ) (Ex )} = E{X X } t t t t t t t t 
for all t > 0, if the nonlinear fuzzy augmented stochastic jump diffusion system in 
(6.15) can be stabilized by u in (6.5), we also have lim ®¥ E x{ xT } = 0, which means t t t t 
the nonlinear MFSJD system can be stabilized by ut in the mean square sense. 
6.4 MULTI-OBJECTIVE H2/H∞ CONTROL DESIGN FOR 
NONLINEAR FUZZY MFSJD SYSTEMS 
The concurrent optimization problem with respect to H2 and H∞ performance is a 
dynamically constrained MOP defned as follows: 
Defnition 6.4: The multi-objective H2/H∞ control design for the nonlinear MFSJD 
system is defned as 
min (J u( ), ( J u )) 2 t ¥ t u t( )ÎUF (6.19) 
subject to (6.15) 
where UF is the set of all the admissible control laws. 
For a multi-objective H2/H∞ control design problem, there exists no unique solu￾tion ut corresponding to both the minimum values of the H2 and H∞ performance. 
Rather, there exists a set of feasible optimal solutions for the multi-objective 
H2/H∞ control design problem in the Pareto optimal sense. The “optimal” control 
design of the MOP for a dynamic system can be seen as how to select a preferred 
solution from the Pareto front to obtain the Pareto optimal solution. In general, for 
an MOP, the domination concept is employed to decide which admissible control 
law is better (i.e., we use domination to defne the “minimization” in the MOP 
in (6.19)). Thus, the solution of the MOP in (6.19) is a set of admissible control 
laws with a nondominated objective vector. The defnition of domination is given 
as follows. 
Defnition 6.5 ([15]): For a multi-objective H2/H∞ control problem, an objec￾tive vector ( , a b ) of the control law ut is said to dominate another objective 
vector ( , a b ˛ of the control law u˛ if and only if both the following conditions are ˛) 
£ ˛ t 
true: (I) aa £ ˛ and bb , and (II) at least one of the two inequalities in (I) with 
strict inequality. Moreover, the admissible control law ut is regarded as a better 
solution than u˛t . 
Unfortunately, there is no effcient method to directly solve the control ut of the MOP 
in (6.19). Thus, we introduce an indirect method to help us solve the MOP in (6.19). 106 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

6.5 FRONT-SQUEEZING LMI-CONSTRAINED MOEA 
An LMI-constrained MOEA has been proposed for the LMI-constrained MOP [79, 
132, 133]. Unlike the traditional MOEA with algebraic functional constraints, as in 
Chapter 1 and [11, 123, 134], the search region of the LMI-constrained MOEA is set 
in an objective space. Thus, the LMI-constrained MOEA has a high computational 
load. 
To decrease the computational load and improve the performance of the 
reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA, we proposed a front-squeezing LMI￾constrained MOEA to help us solve the LMI-constrained MOP in (6.22). The Pareto 
front can be regarded as the boundary between the feasible and infeasible region. 110 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
FIGURE 6.1 Front-squeezing MOEA concurrently searches for the Pareto front of an LMI￾constrained MOP from the feasible and infeasible regions. Here, the dashed line is used to 
indicate the initial search region G. 
The front-squeezing LMI-constrained MOEA concurrently employs the vice front 
Vi and the current parents Pi to approach the Pareto front from two sides of both 
regions shown in Figure 6.1, where the current parents Pi and the vice-front Vi are 
defned as the set of the parent objective vectors of the ith generation and the set of 
currently observed infeasible objective vectors that are the closest to the Pareto front 
in the Pareto optimal sense of the ith generation, respectively. As the iteration num￾ber goes up, the vice front and the current parent front will gradually move closer to 
each other. Eventually, they will overlap. Thus, the Pareto front can be obtained. To 
establish the vice front Vi , we need to introduce the concept of “inverse domination.” 
Defnition 6.10: A given objective vector ( , a b ) is said to inversely dominate ˛ another objective vector ( , a b ˛ ) if and only if both the following conditions are true: 
(I) aa ³ ˛ ³ ˛ and bb , and (II) at least one of the two inequalities in (I) is a strict 
inequality. 
Defnition 6.11: For the multi-objective H2/H∞ control design of the nonlinear 
MFSJD system in (6.1), the ideal objective vector ( , a b )is defned as ( , a b )( * 
, † ˘ ab ) ,
where a*
 and b†
 can be obtained by solving the previous two SOPs in (6.30) and 
(6.31), respectively. 
Design Procedure of the Multi-Objective H2/H∞ Control Design for the Non￾linear MFSJD Systems: Based on the previous analysis, the detailed design proce￾dure of the reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA approach for the multi-objective 
H2/H∞ control design problem in (6.20) of the nonlinear fuzzy MFSJD system is 
given as follows: 
Step 1: Initialization Nonlinear Mean-Field Stochastic Jump-Diffusion Systems 111 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 1.1 Set the initial search region G = ( , a a) ( ´ b, ) b . For the multi￾objective H2/H∞ control design problem, the ideal objective vec￾tor ( , a b ) for the nonlinear fuzzy MFSJD system in (6.7) can 
be easily obtained by solving the two SOPs in (6.30) and (6.31), 
respectively. 
Step 1.2 Set the maximum number of individuals N pop in the EA, the 
iteration number Niter , the crossover rate Mc , and the mutation 
rate Mr (In general, N pop is set to be an even number; the cross￾over rate M and mutation rate M are set to be 0.9 and 0.1, c r
respectively). 
Step 1.3 Randomly select N feasible objective vectors to be parent pop 
candidates Z1 from the search region G and set the vice front 
V1 = {(a b, )}. 
Step 2: Update: If the iteration index i with 1 ££ i N . iter 
Step 2.1 Select the (N pop / 2) individuals from the parent candidates Zi

operator. 
Step 2.2 Make the parents Pi perform the crossover and the mutation 
operator to produce N pop offspring that are bounded by vice 
front Vi and parents Pi are the candidate offspring Qi
 (i.e., each 
candidate offspring should be dominated by vice front Vi but not 
dominated by its parents Pi ) 
Step 2.3 Classify the candidate offspring Qi
 into feasible offspring Qˆ

candidate offspring ( , a b ) has a corresponding feasible solution 1 l 2 l

Step 2.5 Select at most 2N elitist individuals from the set {V ÈQ˜ } pop i i 
to be the vice front Vi+1 of the (i+1)th iteration by using the 
inversely dominant sort. 
Step 2.6 Set the iteration index ii =+ 1.
Step 3: Stop Criteria: Is the iteration index:i Niter > ?
Step 3.1 Once i Niter > , stop the iteration procedure. Let current parents

6.6 SIMULATION EXAMPLE 
In recent years, researchers have focused on system dynamic models to describe 
real economic and fnancial systems [11, 132, 135]. However, in practical cases, the 
fnancial dynamic system is a nonlinear stochastic system and may suffer from con￾tinuous and discontinuous parametric fuctuations due to national and international 
situation changes, oil price changes, the surplus between investment and savings, 
variable interest rates, false economy strategies, and so on. Thus, using a nonlin￾ear stochastic dynamic model to describe a real fnancial system would be more 
appealing [136, 137]. For a fnancial system, the control input signal ut can be seen 
as an intervention or investment strategy. With the rise of quantitative fnance, the 
multi-objective H2/H∞ strategy has been introduced into stochastic fnancial systems. 
Here, we use a nonlinear stochastic MFSJD system to mimic a stock price system. 
Consider the following nonlinear MFSJD fnancial system driven by two Wiener

where S denotes the system state. The state S t( ) is the interest rate of bank A, S t( ) t 1 2 
is the interest rate of bank B, S t( ) is the stock price of Company C, and S t( ) is the 3 4 
stock price of Company D. The mean term ESt
 is used to denote the effects of the 
sample moving average. The terms s (, Sd 1

as two continuous intrinsic fuctuations dependent on system state St

Suppose that optimal H2, optimal H∞, and multi-objective H2/H∞ strategies are
employed by the consortium or government to regulate the nonlinear MFSJD fnan￾cial system in (6.32) to fnally achieve a desired steady state Sd. To do this, the frst 
step is to shift the origin of the nonlinear MFSJD fnancial system in (6.32) to Sd. Let

* Once the iteration number Niter is achieved, the Pareto front Pfront of the MOP for 
the nonlinear MFSJD system in (6.33) can be obtained as shown in Figure 6.2. 
We choose three Pareto optimal strategies from the Pareto front to compare their 
performance as follows: 
Pareto Strategy 1 Pareto Strategy 2 Pareto Strategy 3 
(122.5, 0.8535) (141.8, 0.7336) (166.7, 0.6541) 
Detailed information about the three chosen Pareto strategies is given in Appendix 
6.8.5. Figures 6.3 and 6.4 present the simulation results for the optimal H2, opti￾mal H∞, and three multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy strategies of the nonlinear MFSJD 
fnancial system. It is clear that the optimal H∞ robust intervention strategy has the 
smallest J∞ performance but spends the greatest funds to regulate the stock price 
to the desired steady state with the minimal time to accomplish it. The optimal H2 
intervention strategy has the smallest J2 performance and tends to regulate the stock 
price to the desired steady state via minimal funds. However, it cannot suffer a vola￾tile change of the stock market. Consider the three chosen Pareto optimal strategies. 
Pareto optimal strategy 3 is lopsided on H∞ performance J∞. Pareto optimal strategy 
1 is lopsided on H2 performance J2, and Pareto optimal strategy 2 is a relatively bal￾anced intervention strategy with respect to J2 and J∞. For the three chosen strategies, Nonlinear Mean-Field Stochastic Jump-Diffusion Systems 121 
 
 
 
 
Pareto optimal strategy 3 is most robust; that is, this intervention strategy has the 
minimal vibration when the stock market has drastic intrinsic and external changes. 
On the other hand, Pareto optimal strategy 1 concurrently has minimal J2 perfor￾mance and the best J∞ performance of the three chosen Pareto optimal strategies, 
so it may suffer slight intrinsic and extrinsic changes of the stock market. It is easy 
to observe that Pareto strategy 2 is the preferred solution of the three chosen Pareto 
strategies because Pareto optimal strategy 2 provides a compromise between J2 and 
J∞ to achieve the desired steady state robustly. 
Remark 6.6: The computational complexity of the conventional LMI-constrained 
MOEA in [11] is O r ( 1
2 n n( +1)MN 2
). Thus, the proposed front-squeezing LMI-con￾strained MOEA has a higher computation complexity (see Remark 6.5). However, 
it costs less time to approach the Pareto front by concurrently narrowing the search 
region down via the current parent front and vice front, as shown in Figure 6.1. The 
front-squeezing LMI-constrained MOEA spends 72 h and 53 min to obtain the Pareto 
front in Figure 6.2. However, the conventional LMI-constrained MOEA in [11] 
spends 162 h and 19 mins to obtain a similar results. It is clear that the front-squeez￾ing LMI-constrained MOEA has better computational effciency. 
6.7 CONCLUSION 
This chapter introduced the multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy control design problem of 
nonlinear MFSJD systems for concurrently minimizing H2 and H∞ performance of 
a nonlinear MFSJD system in the Pareto optimal sense. The multi-objective H2/H∞ 
control design problem for nonlinear MFSJD systems is an MOP constrained by 
a nonlinear MFSJD system. Based on the decoupling technique, we can decouple 
the nonlinear fuzzy MFSJD system into two orthogonal subsystems (i.e., a mean 
Ext subsystem and a variation x˜t
 subsystem) and obtain a corresponding fuzzy aug￾mented stochastic jump diffusion system in (6.15). By introducing the Itô-Lévy for￾mula, suffcient conditions for the stability of nonlinear fuzzy MFSJD systems can be 
derived. By using the T-S fuzzy model and the proposed indirect method, the dynam￾ically constrained MOP in (6.19) can be replaced by the LMI-constrained MOP in 
(6.22). Now the LMI-constrained MOP can be effciently solved by the proposed 
front-squeezing LMI-constrained MOEA. As the iteration number grows, the Pareto 
front of the nonlinear MFSJD system can be obtained by a rapid two-sided approach 
scheme from feasible and infeasible regions. When the Pareto front is obtained, the 
designer can select a preferred fuzzy controller from the set of Pareto optimal con￾trollers according to their own preference and complete the multi-objective H2/H∞ 
fuzzy control design. Finally, we give a simulation example to illustrate the design 
procedure and confrm the results through a computer simulation.

7 Multi-Objective 
Fault-Tolerance 
Observer-Based Control 
Design of Stochastic 
Jump-Diffusion Systems 
7.1 INTRODUCTION 
Along with the development of modern industrial production, due to the fact that 
actuators and sensors in control systems have become much more vulnerable to fault 
signals, higher requirements of safety and reliability for control plants have been 
put forward. In order to ensure safety and reliability in the industrial process, the 
capability of fault tolerance during the control process has become an important 
issue and caught the attention of control engineers. In the case of passive fault-tol￾erant control (FTC) design, which considers a fault a specifc external disturbance, 
it aims to achieve control performance with a prescribed fault tolerance level [138– 
140]. On the other hand, for active FTC schemes, fault signals are estimated by an 
observer, and estimated faults will be used to eliminate the effect of real faults. FTC 
techniques have been widely investigated and applied in several felds. To attenuate 
high-frequency variation effects from actuators, FTC is applied for attitude control of 
a satellite in [141]. In [142], FTC was used to stabilize a linear quantum system with 
the consideration of random voltage fuctuations. In [143], operator theory-based 
fault-tolerant control was applied to a multi-input multi-output microreactor. Also, 
in [144], fault-tolerant control was developed for a hypersonic fight vehicle with 
multiple sensor faults. 
For almost the physical systems, there has strongly nonlinearity behavior in the 
physical system. Also, most fault signals are nonlinear functions, which are cou￾pled with state variables and control inputs in physical systems. While consider￾ing the effect of faults in nonlinear systems, nonlinear fault functions will increase 
the diffculty of FTC analysis [143–145]. In recent years, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy 
model has been considered an effcient tool to describe nonlinear dynamic sys￾tems [83, 146]. By utilizing the T-S fuzzy approximation method, a nonlinear sys￾tem can be approximated by interpolating a set of local linear systems, and control 
design for nonlinear systems can be simplifed by a set of fuzzy controllers. The T-S 
fuzzy model–based control scheme has been widely investigated in several control 
issues [147–150]. Moreover, the fuzzy adaptive FTC scheme has been proposed for Multi-Objective Design of Stochastic Jump-Diffusion Systems 129 
fault-tolerant tracking control of a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with nonaff￾ine nonlinear faults [151]. A back-stepping fuzzy control scheme is proposed to deal 
with a stabilization problem with consideration of actuator faults in [152]. In [153], 
event-triggered FTC design for network-based fuzzy systems is also discussed. 
In general, environmental noise is inevitable during the control process. Thus, it 
is expected that FTC design can not only achieve great FTC performance while the 
system is affected by a fault but also achieve the prescribed robust control perfor￾mance for disturbance attenuation. For this reason, several mixed FTC designs, such 
as mixed optimal FTC schemes [154, 155] and mixed robust FTC schemes [156, 
157], have been developed. By extending the concept of a mixed control method 
[70, 158], multi-objective design has become a popular issue and is addressed in 
many research studies on control and estimation [6, 11, 122, 159–161]. Compared 
with conventional mixed H2/H∞ control design schemes [70, 158], which have a 
unique optimal control strategy, there exist several optimal control strategies with 
corresponding multi-objective optimal performance in a multi-objective control 
design. Based on the MO control design, engineers are free to choose the pre￾ferred control strategy from several optimal control strategies according to their 
own demands. At present, there have been very few studies to address the fuzzy 
MO FTC problem of nonlinear systems under sensor and actuator faults. Further, 
in conventional FTC designs, the descriptor observer is always employed for fault 
signal estimation [152–157]. Since the augmented descriptor observer system is 
singular, more effort is needed for robust FTC design. Therefore, conventional 
FTC schemes are not suitable for MO FTC. In this chapter, a smoothed dynamic 
model is proposed to effciently describe actuator and sensor fault signals. Since 
the augmented system with fault dynamic model is nonsingular so that the simple 
conventional Luenberger observer could be employed to precisely estimate state 
variables and fault signals for the consequent H2/H∞ observer-based FTC design 
of T-S fuzzy system with actuator and sensor faults as well as external disturbance 
and measurement noise. 
Despite the fact that the design concept of MO control is suitable for modern 
industry, it is not easy to solve the corresponding multi-objective optimization prob￾lems in general. Especially in fuzzy-based MOPs, computational complexity will be 
great according to the number of fuzzy if-then rules. Among wide ranges of different 
algorithms of nature-inspired optimization methods [112, 162–164], multi-objective 
evolution algorithms are a powerful nature-inspired optimization method to solve 
MOPs [1–3]. In general, conventional MOEAs update design parameters via an evo￾lution algorithm to search the multi-objective vector for Pareto optimal solutions 
via nondominated sorting and crowded tournament selection schemes in the design 
parametric space [1–3, 162–164]. Since the fuzzy controller and observer of complex 
fuzzy systems consist of a large number of local controllers and observers, respec￾tively, it is almost impossible to employ an EA to update these fuzzy controller and 
observer parameters to achieve an MOP of complex T-S fuzzy systems, such as multi￾objective H2/H∞ observer-based FTC of T-S fuzzy systems with actuator and sensor 
faults. This is why conventional MOEAs have not been addressed in the MOPs of 
nonlinear T-S fuzzy systems, even though they are very powerful in MOPs of other, 
simpler designed systems. Besides, for conventional MOEAs, the corresponding 130 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
 
objective vector of the child population randomly generated by crossover and muta￾tion operations may exceed the real Pareto front if the current population is close to 
the real Pareto optimality. Clearly, if the generated child population is infeasible, it 
will be directly discarded. In this situation, it is very diffcult to generate a feasible 
child population while the current population is close to the real Pareto optimality 
[7, 165]. Hence, it is more appealing to override the bottleneck of the conventional 
MOEA to solve a more complex MOP such as multi-objective H2/H∞ observer-based 
FTC of T-S fuzzy systems. 
In this chapter, a simple Luenberger observer-based FTC is designed for the T-S 
fuzzy system with actuator and sensor faults as well as external disturbance and 
measurement noise. In order to achieve the optimal robust attenuation of external 
disturbances on the FTC performance of the controller and observer, the optimal H∞ 
observer-based FTC design is proposed to minimize the effect of the external distur￾bance and measurement noise on the FTC performance of control and observation. 
While the effects of external disturbance and measurement noise have been optimally 
attenuated by the H∞ observer-based control strategy, the H2 observer-based control 
strategy is also proposed to achieve the optimal quadratic control and observation 
simultaneously, that is, to achieve the MOP of multi-objective H2/H∞ observer-based 
FTC of T-S fuzzy systems. 
On the other hand, a reverse-order MOEA is proposed to simplify the design 
procedure of the complex MO H2/H∞ fuzzy observer-based FTC design problem. 
Instead of searching controller and observer parameters directly, we search the 
H2/H∞ objective vector ( , a b ) directly by EA algorithm, nondominated sorting, and 
crowded tournament selection scheme and then fnd the corresponding controller 
and observer parameters using the LMI toolbox in MATLAB via the convex optimi￾zation algorithm indirectly. Based on the reverse-order MOEA and LMI toolbox in 
MATLAB, we can effciently solve the complex MOP of the multi-objective H2/H∞ 
observer-based FTC of T-S fuzzy system. In the future, the proposed reverse-order 
MOEA could be applied to other complex MOPs of nonlinear control and estimation 
design problems. An observer-based 3-D missile guidance system with actuator and 
sensor faults due to sudden cheating side-step maneuvering and hostile jamming, 
respectively, is given to illustrate the design procedure and then validate the perfor￾mance of the proposed multi-objective H2/H∞ optimal fault-tolerant guidance control 
design. Also, a multi-objective H2/H∞ FTC design for an inverted pendulum system 
is carried out in comparison with the state-of-the-art FTC method. 
The main purposes of this chapter are as follows: 
(1) A novel nonsingular smoothed dynamic model is introduced to effciently 
describe the actuator and sensor fault signals. Thus, instead of construct￾ing a conventional singular descriptor estimator for the fault signal, the 
simple Luenberger observer could be employed to precisely estimate state 
variables and actuator and sensor fault signals for the H2/H∞ observer￾based FTC design. Further, compared to the descriptor-based FTC design, 
which has to solve a set of algebraic constraints, the proposed FTC design 
can be transformed into an equivalent LMI-based constrained optimiza￾tion problem, and it is easier to solve for practical application. Multi-Objective Design of Stochastic Jump-Diffusion Systems 131 
 
 
 
(2) Instead of using a conventional MOEA to search the design parameters of 
fuzzy controller and observer gains for the multi-objective H2/H∞ observer￾based FTC design problem, a reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA is 
proposed to directly search the optimal multi-objective vector, and then 
the corresponding design variables of the controller and observer can be 
easily obtained by using the MATLAB LMI toolbox. Further, the proposed 
reverse-order MOEA could be applied to effciently solve other complex 
MOPs of control and estimation in nonlinear or T-S fuzzy systems. 
(3) To improve the rate of convergence of MOEA, a mechanism is included to 
deal with the problem of an infeasible population generated by the muta￾tion and crossover operators in MOEA. By embedding this additional 
mechanism in the proposed reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA, the 
infeasible population is replaced by the mean of itself and the closest feasi￾ble population in the previous iteration. In this situation, the information of 
the infeasible population can be utilized to fnd the closest feasible popula￾tion for each iteration. Hence, the convergence of the proposed MOEA can 
be effectively improved over conventional MOEAs. 
This chapter is divided into fve sections, as follows: the T-S fuzzy system model 
with actuator and sensor faults is introduced in Section 7.2. The virtual fault dynamic 
models are also given in Section 7.2. In Section 7.3, we develop the multi-objective 
optimal H2/H∞ observer-based FTC design for the T-S fuzzy system with sensor and 
actuator faults. A reverse-order MOEA for the multi-objective observer-based FTC 
design is proposed in Section 7.4. The simulation of a fault-tolerant missile guid￾ance control design of a 3-D tactical missile system and FTC design for inverted 
pendulum system are proposed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in 
Section 7.5. Conclusions are given in Section 7.6.

is, the pair (, A B ) is controllable and the pair ( , A C ) is observable for i = 1,..., I . i u,i i i 
In this chapter, in order to effciently estimate fault signals f t( ) and f t( ) by the a s 
conventional Luenberger observer for the FTC design in the sequel, a novel dynamic 
smoothed model is proposed for fault signals f t( ) and f t( ). To begin with, based a s

f t( ) is given as follows: a

where e ( )t ,...,e ( )t denote the corresponding approximation errors of the deriv- 1,a k,a 
ative at different smoothed time points for actuator fault f t( ). The constant h is a a 
small enough time interval. Further, in order to reduce the effect of future fault signal 
ft + h) on the dynamic smoothed model of fault signal f t( ), ft + h) could be also a ( a a ( 
represented by extrapolation (e.g., Lagrange extrapolation [166]) as follows: 
k 
ft ( + h) = å a ft ( - ih ) +d () t (7.4) a i a a i=0 
where ai , i = 0,..., k are the extrapolation coeffcients, and d a ( )t indicates the extra￾polation error of ft h a ( + ). Then, we could obtain the following dynamic smoothed 
model of actuator fault signal f t( ). a

Remark 7.1: For the T-S fuzzy system in (7.2) with the signal faults on actua￾tors and sensors, it is diffcult to construct a suitable fault estimation scheme due 
to the unknown prior knowledge of the actuator faults and the sensor faults. In the 
traditional augmented descriptor observer design, the unknown input is not easily 
estimated (i.e., the fault signal decoupling condition cannot always be satisfed [140]. 
Therefore, more efforts are needed to effciently estimate the state and fault informa￾tion. In this chapter, unlike the conventional descriptor model [167], the nonsingular 
fault dynamic models of f t( ) and f t( ) in (7.5) and (7.6) are to be embedded in the a s 
augmented system with the T-S fuzzy system in (7.2). In this situation, the conven￾tional Luenberger observer could be employed to precisely estimate the state varia￾bles and actuator and sensor fault signals to effciently compensate the effect of fault 
signals and external disturbance for the FTC design. 134 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

For the convenience of estimating x t( ) and f t( ), f t( ) simultaneously, the dynamic a s 
smoothed model of fault signals in (7.5) and (7.6) could be embedded as an internal

Proof: Please refer to Appendix 7.7.1. 
Remark 7.2: The physical meaning of the conditions in (7.11) and (7.12) is that 
the fault state f t( ) of the dynamic smoothed model in (7.5) and fault state f t( ) of a s 
the dynamic smoothed model in (7.6) are all observable in the augmented system 
in (7.7). 
Suppose the following conventional fuzzy Luenberger observer is proposed to 
deal with the estimation of the state variables and actuator and sensor fault signals of 
the nonlinear system in (7.2) or the state of the augmented system in (7.7): 
Observer Rule : i

Then (7.13)

ˆ yt ˆ() = C ( )t i x 
°((n a s +n )(k +1) + ´ n) m where Li Î is the observer parameters for i = 1,..., I . The vectors 
(n +n )(k+1)+n a s x
ˆ() t Î ° and y t ˆ() Î °m are the estimated state and measurement output 
for the T-S fuzzy system in (7.7), respectively. Then the overall fuzzy observer can 
be designed as follows: 
ˆ
˛ I () = ( ( ))( ˆ x t å h z t A x() t + B u() t + L ( ( yt ) - y t ˆ( ))) i=1 i i u i, i

ˆ() = h z( (t)) C x t ˆ yt å ( ) I

Remark 7.3: In general, the state variables x( )t in (7.7) are not accessible. Thus, 
the estimated state can be specifed as the premise variables in the T-S fuzzy model 
(7.14), that is, z t() = x t . ˆ() 
In this chapter, we employ the T-S fuzzy observer-based controller to deal with the 
fault-tolerant controller design of the T-S fuzzy system in (7.14). Thus, the jth fuzzy

disturbance w( )t due to external disturbance, modeling errors of fault signals and 
measurement noises in (7.18) will signifcantly infuence the state estimation and 
control performance, the following MO observer-based control is designed to H∞ 
optimally attenuate the effect of w( )t on the observer-based fault-tolerant control and 
H2 optimally achieve the observer-based fault-tolerant quadratic control performance 
simultaneously.

In the closed-loop observer-based output feedback T-S fuzzy control system in 
(7.18), the effects of the smoothed model error of sensor and actuator faults, 
external disturbance and measurement noise in w( )t will deteriorate the control 
and estimation performance of the observer-based FTC system and even lead to 
the instability of the fuzzy observer-based FTC system. In this situation, how to

the external disturbance and the measurement noise in w( )t to guarantee robust 
control performance will be an important design goal for the fuzzy observer-based 
fault-tolerant control system. Since H∞ control is the most important robust control 
design to effciently eliminate the effect of uncertain w( )t on the FTC system, it 
will be employed to deal with the robust observer-based FTC design problem for 
the T-S fuzzy system in (7.18). Let us consider the following H∞ observer-based

T () x 0 = T 0 P˜( ) for some PP > 0 in the numerator of (7.19) is
used to deduct the effect of initial condition x˜( ) 0 on the H∞ control and estimation 
performance. The main purpose of the H∞ control and estimation performance is to 
eliminate the effect of external disturbance and measurement noise on the control 
and estimation performance of the observer-based T-S fuzzy FTC system in (7.18). 
Most of the time, the nonlinear system is always in the normal condition without 
the occurrence of external disturbance and measurement noise. The consideration of 
H∞ FTC design is not enough, and it may lead to a very conservative design. Hence, 
the following H2 optimal control and estimation design, without the consideration 
of disturbance signal w( )t , is more appealing for control engineers to achieve opti￾mal quadratic observer-based fault-tolerant control via a proper choice of weighting 
matrices: 
I tf T T H L K ˜ ˜ ({ ,} ) = x ( )t Q x t( ) + u t R u t dt ò ˜ ˜ ( ) ( ) (7.20) 2 i j i j , =1 0 2 2 
where R˜ ˜ is the weighting matrix of control effort, and Q = diag{0 , 2 2 n k( +´ 1) n k( +1) a a 
0 + ,Q˜ ,Q˜ } with the weighting matrix Q˜ ³ 0 on the system state x t( ) n k( +1)´n k( 1) 2,x 2,e 2,x s s 
and the weighting matrix Q˜ ³ 0 on the estimation error e t( ). The weighting matri- 2,e 
ces Q˜ 
2 ³ 0 and R˜ 
2 > 0 are specifed beforehand according to the design purpose of 
the FTC. Thus, the multi-objective optimal H2/H∞ observer-based FTC design prob￾lem for the fuzzy observer-based control system in (7.18) is given as follows: 
L K I L K }I min (H ({, } ), H ({, )) 2 i j i j , =1 ¥ i j i j , =1 L K, i j

H
In this MOP, there exists a set of Pareto optimal solutions for the multi-objective 
optimal H2/H∞ observer-based FTC design problem in the Pareto optimal sense. In 
general, it is not easy to solve the MOP in (7.21) directly. Thus, in this study, an 
indirect method is proposed in the following to solve the MOP in (7.21) for multi-ob￾jective optimal H2/H∞ FTC design from the suboptimal perspective: 
min(a b,) 
{, }

a >0,b >0 (7.22) 
subject to 2 ({ , }j ij ) £ a, H ({ , } , 1 H L K ) £ b I L K I 
i , =1 ¥ i j i j= 
Since the MOP needs to minimize the multiple objective functions simultaneously, 
we use Pareto domination instead of conventional minimization. The solution of the * * I MOP in (7.22) is a set of fuzzy control and observer parameters { , L K } with the i j i j , =1 
corresponding nondominated objective vector ( , * * a b ) . Before further analysis, the
following fundamental defnitions are provided: 
Defnition 7.1 (Pareto Dominance [2]): For the MOP in (7.22), a solution 1 1 I 1 1 { , L K } with feasible objective vector ( , a b ) is said to dominate i j i j , =1 
2 2 I 2 2 another solution { , L K } with feasible objective vector ( , a b ) if and i j i j , =1 
1 £ 2 1 £ 2 if only a a and b b and at least one of two inequalities with strict 
inequality. 
Defnition 7.2 (Pareto Optimal Solution [2]): For the MOP in (7.22), the * * I * * solution { , L K } with the corresponding objective vector ( , a b ) is a i j i j , =1 
Pareto optimal solution if and only if it could not be dominated by any other 
solution. 
Remark 7.4: Under the concept of Pareto optimal solution [2], the Pareto opti￾mal solution of the MOP in (7.21) is not unique; that is, there exists a set of Pareto 
optimal solutions for the MOP in (7.21). Since there exist multiple solutions, it is not 
easy to solve the MOP in (7.21) by conventional optimization techniques. 
Theorem 7.2: The MOP in (7.22) is equivalent to the MOP in (7.21) if the Pareto 
optimal solutions are achieved. 
Proof: The proof is simple if we can prove that two inequalities in the constraints of 
(7.22) become equalities when the optimization objective vector ( , * * a b )is achieved.
We will prove this by contradiction. Suppose the inequality constraints in (7.22) 
are strictly held for a Pareto optimal solution ( , a b¢ ¢) ; that is, there exists a Pareto 
æ I ö I optimal solution ( ,¢ ¢) L ¢, ¢ ÷ < a¢ and H ({L ¢ a b such that H ç , } K¢ < b¢ 2 ç{ } i K j ÷ ¥ i j i j , 1= )

nated by ( , a b*

completes the inference of contradiction. Multi-Objective Design of Stochastic Jump-Diffusion Systems 139 
Based on Theorem 7.2, the MOP for the multi-objective H2/H∞ observer-based 
FTC problem becomes the MOP in (7.22). Before we solve the MOP in (7.22), the 
following lemma is given:

have

Theorem 7.3: The MOP in (7.22) for the multi-objective optimal H2/H∞ fault￾tolerant control design can be transformed into the following MOP:

Proof: Please refer to Appendix 7.7.2. 
By choosing the general Lyapunov function V x˜ t = xT ( ( )) ˜ () t Px t ˜( ) with posi￾tive defnite matrix P > 0, the multi-objective optimal H2/H∞ FTC design can be
transformed into the MOP in (7.23)–(7.26). However, since the constraints in 
(7.24)–(7.26) are bilinear constraints, it cannot be solved directly by any current 
optimization technique. Thus, by choosing the Lyapunov function for the augmented 
fuzzy observer-based control system in (7.18) as the sums of Lyapunov functions of 
two sub-systems, that is, V x( (˜ t )) = x () () + e t P e t with P > 0 and P > 0, T t P x t T () ( ) 1 2 1 2 
the design problem can be transformed into the MOP in (7.28)–(7.31), and it can be 
easily solved by MATLAB LMI toolbox with the proposed two-step design proce￾dure and reverse-order MOEA in the sequel. To begin with, some decoupling tech￾niques are employed for the weighting matrices Q˜ of H∞ control performance and

If we could solve ( , * * ab )of the MOP in (7.28)–(7.31) with the corresponding

Remark 7.5: (i) If we only consider the optimal H2 observer-based FTC of T-S 
fuzzy system, then the MOP in (7.28) is reduced to the following single-objective 
optimization problem:

(ii) If we only consider the optimal H∞ observer-based FTC of the T-S fuzzy sys￾tem, then the MOP in (7.28) is reduced to the following SOP:

L K (7.34) j i j ) , =1 ,b >0 
subject to the matrix constraints in (7.31) 
Remark 7.6: Since the constraints in (7.29) and (7.31) are BMIs, it cannot be 
effciently solved via current optimization techniques. As a result, a two-step design 
procedure is developed to solve the MOP in (7.28)–(7.31): 
(i) If the inequality constraints in (7.29) and (7.31) hold, then the suffcient 
and necessary conditions are that the diagonal terms of (7.29) and (7.31) 
must be negative. Thus, by letting Z = K W , we frst solve the linear con- j j 1 
straints D¢¢2 1, < 0 in (7.29) and D¢¢
¥,1 < 0 in (7.31) to obtain the solution W1 
* 
Z* I and { } by using the MATLAB convex optimization toolbox. Once the i i=1 
Z* I solutions W*
 and { } are obtained, the corresponding fuzzy controller 1 i i=1 
* * * -1 can be constructed as Kj = Zi (W1 ) . 
K* I
(ii) By letting Y = P L with the fxed matrices W*
 and { }j j=1 obtained from i 2 i 2 
step 1 in (7.29) and (7.31), the constraints in (7.29) and (7.31) become linear 
matrix inequalities, which are solvable by utilizing the MATLAB convex 
optimization toolbox. Thus, we can solve (7.29)–(7.31) effciently to obtain * * I * * I the optimal solutions P2 and {} Yi i=1. Once the solutions P2 and { } Yi i=1 
are obtained, the corresponding fuzzy observer can be constructed as 
* * -1 * L = ( ) P Y . i 2 i 
Remark 7.7: If the robust H∞ performance in (7.19) or (7.52) is satisfed with 
positive defnite weighting matrix Q˜ 
1 and a prescribed disturbance attenuation level + n b > 0 and external disturbance W() t Î L R(, R ), the right-hand side in (7.52) is 2 
fnite as tf ® ¥. As a result, it reveals the state variables will converge to zero by the 
proposed controller; that is, asymptotic stability for the fuzzy observer-based FTC 
system in (7.18) is guaranteed. 
7.4 REVERSE-ORDER LMI-CONSTRAINED MOEA FOR 
MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMAL H2/H∞ OBSERVER-BASED 
FAULT-TOLERANT DESIGN OF T-S FUZZY SYSTEMS 
In the conventional MOEA, the algorithm employs an evolution algorithm to search 
the parameter of {, ,, L W P K L } to solve the MOP in (7.28)–(7.31) directly. However, 1 2 i i i=1 
there are too many fuzzy controller and observer parameters to be searched to achieve 
the optimal objective vector ( , * * ab ) . Obviously, it is almost impossible to employ the 
conventional MOEA to the MOP in (7.28)–(7.31) to solve the multi-objective H2/H∞ 
observer-based FTC design problem. Different from the conventional multi-objective 
evolution algorithm that directly searches the solutions {, ,, ,, }L ab W P K L of the 1 2 i i i=1 142 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
multi-objective optimal H2/H∞ observer-based FTC design in (7.28), the proposed 
reverse-order MOEA only searches the feasible objective vectors ( , a b ). Then, by 
substituting the objective vectors ( , a b ) into (7.29)–(7.31), the corresponding solu￾tions { , KL }I can be easily obtained by using MATLAB LMI toolbox. As a result, i j i j , =1 
the multi-objective optimal H2/H∞ observer-based FTC design in (7.28) can be effec￾tively solved by the proposed reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA and MATLAB 
LMI toolbox. Before further analysis of the LMI-constrained MOP in (7.28)–(7.31), 
some fundamental defnitions of MOPs are given in the following: 
Defnition 7.3 ([2]): For the LMI-constrained MOP in (7.28)–(7.31) for multi￾objective H2/H∞ observer-based FTC design in the T-S fuzzy system with actuator 
and sensor faults in (7.1), the ideal objective vector is defned as ( , + + , where a+ ab ) 
and a+
 can be obtained by solving the SOP in (7.33) and (7.34), respectively. 
Defnition 7.4 ([2]): For the LMI-constrained MOP in (7.28)–(7.31), the solu- * * * * I * * tion { , WP ,{KL , } }with the corresponding objective vector ( , a b ) is 1 2 j i i j , =1

Defnition 7.5 ([2]): For the LMI-constrained MOP in (7.28)–(7.31), the Pareto

that is, the Pareto optimal solution set collects the Pareto optimal solutions for the 
MOP in (7.28)–(7.31). 
Defnition 7.6 ([2]): For the LMI-constrained MOP in (7.28)–(7.31), the Pareto 
front is defned as follows:

that is, the Pareto front W collects the objective vectors of the Pareto optimal Front 
solutions in WOpt . 
Once the Pareto front W is obtained, the corresponding fuzzy controller gains Front * I * I { } and fuzzy observer gain { } can be constructed for multi-objective H2 Kjj =1 Li i=1 /H∞

on the analysis, a design procedure based on the proposed reverse-order LMI-con￾strained MOEA method for the multi-objective optimal H2/H∞ observer-based FTC

N are feasible in the LMI i i i=1

j = {(a b˜ Np a b˜ as P ˜ , )} . If there exists a child population ( ,˜ ) that is not Parent i i i=1

To sum up, the multi-objective optimal H2/H∞ FTC design problem is transformed 
into the BMI-constrained multi-objective problem. Consequently, the BMI￾constrained MOP can be solved by utilizing the proposed reverse-order MOEA and 
the MATLAB LMI toolbox. 
Remark 7.8: The computational complexity of the proposed reverse-order MOEA 
for the LMI-constrained MOP in (7.28)–(7.31) is about O n( 2 IN N2 ), which includes i p 
O n( 2 I) in solving two-step LMIs in (7.29)–(7.31) and O NiNp 
2 ( ) in the reverse-order 
MOEA, where I is the number of fuzzy rules, n is the dimension of positive-defnite 
matrix P, Np is the population number, and Ni
 is the iteration number. 
Remark 7.9: Since the augmented system in (7.18) includes the smoothed model 
of the actuator and sensor signals, the dimensions of the augmented system will be 
enlarged if we use more points to extrapolate the actuator fault f t( + h) and sensor a 
fault f t( + h). As a result, the computing complexity directly depends on the dimen- s 
sions of the smoothed model of actuator and sensor signals. 
Remark 7.10: In the proposed reverse-order MOEA for multi-objective H2/H∞ 
observer-based FTC design, the designer should give the following parameters for 
the MOEA: 
°2 (I) Search region R = [a ,a ] [ ´ b , b ]Î with alo Î ° 0, a Î ° 0 , low up low up w ³ up ³ 
blow Î ° ³0, and b up Î ° ³0 
(II) Population number Np Î  
(III) Iteration number Ni Î  
(IV) Crossover rate Cr Î[ , 0 1] 
(V) Mutation rate Cm Î[ , 0 1] 
On the other hand, at the start of the algorithm, Np populations are randomly gener￾ated from the search region R and are set as the initial population. 
Remark 7.11: Recently, with the advance of interpolation methods, the nonlinear 
inequality constraint can be equivalently transformed into a combination of local 
linearized matrix inequalities with corresponding interpolation functions, such as the 146 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
 
˛
fuzzy interpolation method and global linearization method. As a result, by utilizing 
these interpolation methods, the proposed reverse-order MOEA can be applied to 
general MOPs with nonlinear inequality constraints, such as multi-objective optimal 
controller design for nonlinear systems. 
Remark 7.12: In the proposed reverse-order MOEA, the initial populations are 
randomly generated from the predefned search region. Clearly, if the initial popu￾lations are close to the real Pareto front, the MOEA will take less time to approach 
the real Pareto front, that is, global optimality. As a result, the convergence of the 
proposed reverse-order MOEA is related to the choice of search region. In this study, 
the search region is defned as R = [a ,a ] [ ´ b , b ], where alow and blow can be low up low up 
obtained by solving the two SOPs in (7.33) and (7.34). On the other hand, a up and 
b can be chosen as several times of alow and blow, respectively, such as a = qa , up up low 
for some q Î ° + . In this situation, the randomly generated initial populations will fall 
into the feasible region of the constraints in (7.24)–(7.26). 
7.5 SIMULATION EXAMPLE 
To illustrate the design procedure and validate the performance of proposed MO 
H2/H∞ observer-based FTC scheme, two simulation examples are provided. A tac￾tical missile guidance system suffering from actuator and sensor fault signals is 
given. Based on the proposed smoothed model, the fault signals are embedded in 
an augmented missile system. Then the proposed MO H2/H∞ observer-based FTC 
problem is given to the tactical missile guidance system. Finally, the MO opti￾mal H2/H∞ observer-based FTC design problem is transformed into the BMI-con￾strained multi-objective problem, which can easily be solved by utilizing the 
proposed reverse-order MOEA and MATLAB LMI toolbox. On the other hand, the 
FTC design problem of balancing and swing-up of an inverted pendulum on a cart 
is considered with a comparison between the proposed method and conventional 
FTC design in [168]. 
Example 7.1: Consider the 3-D missile guidance system in the spherical coor￾dinate ( ,r y q, ) with the origin fxed at the missile. The pursuit-evasion geometry 
between a missile such as a Patriot at the origin and a target such as an incoming   ballistic missile is shown in Figure 7.1. Let ( , e e r y , ) q e be the unit vector along the 
coordinate axis. The 3-D relative velocity is obtained through the differentiation of 
the relative distance vector r along with the line of sight as follows [92, 100]: 
˛   ˛ r = r˛ e + r y ˛ cos( q ) e + rq e (7.35) r y q 
   Hence, the relative acceleration at the direction of er , ey , and eq can be obtained by 
differentiating the previous equation in the following:

where u and u are the control inputs, and w , w , and w are the target acceleration y q r y q

represented by the following state space system:

To avoid the attack of a tactical missile such as the Patriot, the target will generate 
y 
a jamming signal to interfere with the laser sensor through the wireless channel, 
-
which will lead to an equivalent sensor fault signal. On the other hand, the target 
will perform sudden side-step maneuvering through its two-side jets, which will 
lead to an equivalent actuator fault in the missile system. By considering the sensor 
and actuator faults by hostile jamming and sudden side-step maneuvering, respec￾tively, the missile guidance system in (7.37) with actuator and sensor faults should

To model the actuator and sensor faults, the third-order smoothed model in (7.5) is

In the missile guidance control, when v t() ® 0 and v t() ® 0, it means the missile y q 
and target in are the head-on condition [100]. Among three relative velocities, only 
the relative velocity v t( ) along with line of sight decreases the distance between r 
the missile and the target; that is, v t( ) could decrease the relative distance between r 
missile. Therefore, v t( ) could not be zero in the missile guidance process; that is, r 
v t() ¹ 0. In this situation, to ensure the head-on condition, the controlled output r 
h() = [ ( v ), y q t t v ( )t ]

system in (7.38) can be obtained as:

Therefore, to meet the head-on condition for MO H2/H∞ observer-based fault-tol￾erant control, the weighting matrices Q˜ 
1 and Q˜ 
2 in (7.19) and (7.20) should be spec￾ifed as:

On the other hand, to ensure the estimation performance on state variables and actu￾ator and sensor fault signals in the missile guidance system, the weighting matrices 
Q˜ and Q˜ in Q˜ and Q˜ are chosen as the full rank matrix. 1,e 2,e 1 2 
To apply the MOEA for the MO H2/H∞ observer-based FTC in (7.28), the design 
parameters of MOEA are given as:

Mutation Rate C : 0.15 m 
Population Number Np : 300 
Once the iteration number is achieved in the MOEA, the Pareto front of the MO H2/H∞ 
fault-tolerant observer-based control design is plotted, as shown in Figure 7.2. In the 
Pareto front, each red point represents a Pareto optimal solution with the correspond￾ing optimal H2 observer-based FTC performance and optimal H∞ observer-based 
FTC performance. Since the objective vectors of obtained Pareto optimalities cannot 
be decreased anymore in Figure 7.2, the obtained Pareto front is nearly equivalent to 
the real Pareto front. According to their requirements, the designer is free to choose 
the Pareto optimal solution. In this study, the marked point ( . 8 9´106
, . 0 61) in Fig￾ure 7.2, which is the so-called knee-solution, is chosen as the solution. In general, 
the knee solution has the beneft of balanced performance between H2 and H∞ perfor￾mance. From the knee point, the fuzzy controllers and observers can be constructed * * - * * -1 * as K = Z (W ) 1 and L = ( ) P Y for i j , = 1,...,48.

where lT denotes the target’s navigation random gain from 0 to 2G. The measurement 
noise and the initial condition of the missile guidance system in (38) are given as:

x0 = [4900, pi / , 3 pi / , 3 -1000 500 500, ]T , 
In general, to avoid the attack of the missile, the target can perform sudden side-step 
maneuvering with its two-side jets and transmit a jamming signal to interfere with 
the missile, which could lead to equivalent actuator and sensor faults, respectively. 
In this simulation, the equivalent actuator fault signal due to the sudden side-step 
maneuvering by two-side jets and sensor fault signal are shown as the square and 
cosine-type signals in Figure 7.3, respectively. Especially for the cosine-type sensor 
fault, the target aims to interfere with the estimation of relative velocity, yaw angular 
velocity, and pitch angular velocity with a large oscillation effect. 
FIGURE 7.3 (a) The square actuator fault and (b) the cosine-type sensor fault signal. Multi-Objective Design of Stochastic Jump-Diffusion Systems 153 
In this simulation, the states of the missile guidance system and the corresponding 
estimated states are plotted in Figures 7.4–7.6. From the results in Figures 7.4–7.6, 
the Luenberger observer-based controller could successfully track the system states 
at t = 0 0. 6s; that is, the Luenberger observer completely estimates the missile guid￾ance system from t = 0 0. 6s. From t = 1 s, the target begins to perform sudden side￾step maneuvering. Since the proposed Luenberger observer-based controller can 
quickly estimate the actuator fault, the effect of the actuator fault can be cancelled 
out by the proposed MO H2/H∞ observer-based fault-tolerant controller; that is, the 
actuator fault is cancelled by the estimated actuator fault. For the cosine-type sensor 
fault signal, Figures 7.5–7.6 reveal that the relative angular velocities of the yaw and 
pitch angles slightly fuctuate around the real states in the control process. With the 
proposed MO H2/H observer-based fault-tolerant controller, the missile can suc- ∞ 
cessfully hit the target at = 4 9. st with the head-on condition; that is, the relative dis￾tance, yaw angular velocity, and pitch angular velocity of missile guidance system 
approach 0 at t = 4 9. s. Once the target is hit, the actuator and sensor fault signals 
vanish after t = 4 9. s. 
The simulation results in Figure 7.7 show the actuator and sensor faults and their 
estimation. In the beginning, due to the large estimation error (large initial condition) 
on the missile guidance system state, there have large but short estimated actuator 
and sensor fault signals. After that, the Luenberger observer can precisely estimate 
the actuator and sensor fault signals. The control strategies u t( ) and u t( ) are shown y q

in Figure 7.8, and it is seen that the proposed observer-based control strategies are 
effective to achieve the missile guidance task. Moreover, once the actuator fault 
signal is estimated, it can be seen that the control strategies will use the estimated 
actuator fault signal to eliminate the real actuator fault signal. In general, due to 
the external disturbance, the actuator and sensor fault signal from the target, it is 
very diffcult for the missile to achieve the head-on condition; that is, the control 
period is increased by the actuator and sensor fault signal. Nevertheless, with the 
proposed MO H2/H∞ observer-based fault-tolerant controller, the effect of external 
disturbance on the missile guidance system is greatly attenuated, and the effect of the 
actuator and sensor fault signals is eliminated. Hence, as seen from the 3-D graph in 
Figure 7.9, the missile can maintain the head-on condition and successfully hit the 
target. The code fle is included in [170] for performance validation.

To efficiently estimate the actuator fault signal f t( ) in (7.42), the third-order a

a = 0 2. , a = 0 1. , and a = 0 1. of A in (7.5). Also, the third-order smoothed 1 2 3 fa 
signal model for the sensor fault signal is chosen with the extrapolation coef￾ficients b = 0 6. , b = 0 2. , b = 0 1. 5, and b = 0 0. 5 of A in (7.6). Since the 0 1 2 3 fs 
pendulum system is free of sensor fault signals, the weighting matrix in (7.27) 
is chosen as: 
Q˜ = diag{ 0 , I , , I 0 , } I 1 8´8 2 4 4´4 2 
Q ˜ = diag{ 0 ,2I , , I 0 ,2I } 2 8´8 2 4 4´4 2

that is, the weighting of sensor fault estimation in Q˜

crossover rate Cr = 0 8. , and mutation rate Cm = 0 1. . Then, by solving the MOP in * * (7.28), the optimal control performance ( , a b ) ( = 23 21 ., 1 3. )1 is selected, and the
corresponding design variables can refer to [169]. 
In this simulation, the external disturbance and measurement noise are set as 
01 (0 0 2) and 0 1. N( , . ) a . N ,. 00 2 , respectively. The actuator fault signal ft () = 10 for 
0–20 s is set to represent an unknown constant fault in the actuator. The simula￾tion results are shown in Figures 7.10–7.15. From Figures 7.10–7.11, the pendu￾lum system can be effectively stabilized to zero with a high disturbance attenuation 
level. Furthermore, since the actuator fault signal f t( ) is precisely estimated in a 
Figure 7.12, its effect can be effectively eliminated by the proposed FTC design. 
The FTC design in [168] is carried out for comparison with our design. From Fig￾ures 7.13–7.14, it can be clearly seen that the state variables severely oscillate during 158 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

7.6 CONCLUSION 
Based on the proposed dynamic smoothed signal model, a novel reverse-order 
LMI-constrained MOEA was proposed to solve a complex multi-objective observer￾based FTC of a T-S fuzzy system, which could not be solved by the conventional 
MOEA due to large fuzzy control and observer parameters to be selected by evo￾lution algorithm for multi-objective optimization. Through the proposed indirect 
suboptimal method, the multi-objective observer-based FTC design problem is 
reduced to an LMI-constrained MOP, which could be effciently solved by the 
proposed reverse-order MOEA with the help of the LMI toolbox in MATLAB 
via convex optimization algorithms such as the interior point method. Finally, 
the proposed reverse-order MOEA is applied to effciently solve the complex 
multi-objective H2/H∞ observer-based 3-D missile fault-tolerant guidance control 
problem with sensor and actuator faults due to sudden cheating jet maneuvering 
and hostile interference. Also, the proposed method is applied to FTC design for 
an inverted pendulum system in comparison with the state-of-the-art FTC method. 
Further, the proposed reverse-order MOEA could be an effcient scheme to solve 
different MOP controls and estimation of complex T-S fuzzy systems in both the 
application and research felds. Also, along with the rapid development of the 
Internet of Things (IoT), information can be quickly exchanged in networked sys￾tems via wireless communication techniques to achieve more challenging tasks. 
Meanwhile, there may be malicious signals from attackers who try to damage the 
networked system and interfere with transmitted signals. Since the requirements 
of safety and reliability for networked systems are important issues, the proposed 
FTC method will be applied to the networked-based control system to achieve 
multi-objective optimal design with consideration of malicious attack signals in 
the future.

8 Multi-Objective H2/H∞ 
Optimal Filter Design 
of Nonlinear Stochastic 
Signal Processing Systems 
8.1 INTRODUCTION 
This fltering approach has been used to address many engineering problems, and, 
in general, it is diffcult to design an effcient flter to estimate the state of non￾linear systems in control and signal processing. The extended Kalman flter (EKF) 
is regarded as an adaptive linearized flter based on the current state estimate of 
nonlinear systems [172–174]. The design of the EKF relies on exact knowledge of 
nonlinear dynamics and the second-order statistical properties of external distur￾bance and measurement noise. Some fltering problems have been solved for linear 
uncertain systems [175, 176]. The H∞ flter was recently proposed for robust state 
estimation of nonlinear stochastic systems [177–189]. However, this flter requires 
the solution of a complex Hamilton-Jacobi equation, which cannot easily be solved 
except in the case of simple nonlinear systems. In recent years, there has been a 
growing interest in the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model for nonlinear systems since it is a 
powerful solution that bridges the gap between linear control and complex nonlinear 
systems [182, 184, 185, 190–197]. The important advantage of the T-S fuzzy model 
is its universal approximation of any smooth nonlinear function by interpolating 
certain local linear systems. 
Since it requires exact knowledge of the noise covariance values, the H2 flter is 
an optimal flter in the least-mean-squares error sense [172, 173]. However, in the 
real-world scenario, H2 fltering performance will deteriorate if the noise statistics 
are not exact. Recently, as a means to remedying the shortcomings of the H2 flter, the 
H∞ robust flter has received considerable attention for its robust properties against 
external disturbances from the point of view of worst-case attenuation [175–189, 
198, 199]. The advantage of using the H∞ flter in comparison with the H2 flter in 
terms of performance is that it may lead to a more robust but conservative result. 
More recently, the mixed H2/H∞ flter was designed so that H2 optimal fltering per￾formance may be obtained with a prescribed H∞ fltering performance to attenuate 
the effect of uncertain noise on the fltering error; that is, the conventional H2/H∞ 
flter design is an H2 optimal flter design problem under a prescribed robust H∞ 
fltering constraint and is essentially only a single objective problem in flter design 
[9, 34, 71, 74, 198, 200–204]. Although most existing studies specify flter design 
characteristics in the form of an SOP, multiple objectives for flter design arise 170 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
naturally in real-life scenarios. These objectives normally confict with each other 
such that they cannot be maximized or minimized simultaneously. As an alternative 
to fnding the global optimal solution in an SOP, Pareto optimal solutions have been 
obtained for MOPs [2, 77, 205], and recently MOPs have become an active research 
area [77, 206]. However, most MOPs only focus on algebraic systems and have still 
not been applied to the design problem of dynamic systems. Therefore, further efforts 
are needed to extend these results to the multi-objective H2/H∞ flter design problem 
of nonlinear dynamic systems. 
In this chapter, the proposed multi-objective fuzzy flter design is able to simul￾taneously achieve optimal H2 and H∞ fltering performance for nonlinear signal 
processing; that is, the multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design is an MOP for non￾linear signal processing. In classical optimization methods, the MOP is converted 
to an SOP by emphasizing one particular Pareto optimal solution at a time using the 
weighted-sum method [207–209]. As this approach is to be used for discovering 
multiple solutions, different weightings have to be applied several times, hopefully 
fnding a solution in each simulation run. Recently, a number of MOEAs have been 
proposed to fnd multiple Pareto optimal solutions of algebraic systems effciently 
in one single simulation run [2, 77, 205, 210, 211]. Although the MOEAs have 
been widely employed to solve the MOPs of certain algebraic functional systems, 
further efforts are required to apply them to the MO fuzzy flter design problem for 
nonlinear stochastic fuzzy dynamic systems. Generally, the MOP for a fuzzy flter 
design in a nonlinear stochastic fuzzy dynamic system is more diffcult than speci￾fying a variable to minimize the multi-objective function in conventional MOPs for 
algebraic systems. 
In this chapter, we propose a multi-objective H2/H flter design to simulta- ∞ 
neously achieve optimal H2 and H∞ fltering performance for nonlinear stochas￾tic systems. In this situation, H2 fltering performance requires minimization for 
least-mean-squares fltering performance, and H∞ fltering performance needs to 
be minimized for the worst-case effect of uncertain disturbance and measure￾ment noise on the fltering error; that is, the H flter is designed as a robust ∞ 
flter for all possible external disturbance w k( ) and measurement noise n k( ) by 
minimizing their worst-case effect on fltering performance. Therefore, the MO 
fuzzy flter design problem translates to minimizing the H2 and H∞ fltering per￾formance simultaneously for nonlinear fuzzy signal systems with uncertain dis￾turbance and measurement noise. For convenience of design, the T-S fuzzy model 
is frst employed to interpolate several local stochastic systems to approximate 
a nonlinear stochastic signal system. We assume that the fuzzy signal system is 
corrupted with uncertain disturbance and measurement noise. However, it is not 
easy to solve the multi-objective H2 and H∞ fltering design problems of nonlinear 
stochastic signal systems directly. However, employing an indirect method, the 
multi-objective fuzzy flter design can be reduced to an MOP of how to minimize 
the two upper bounds of H2 and H∞ fltering performance under the constraint 
of a set of LMIs; that is, the MOP of multi-objective H2/H∞ fltering design by 
the fuzzy flter can be converted into an LMI-constrained MOP. Due to the con￾vexity of LMIs [212], the LMI-constrained MOP of multi-objective H2/H∞ flter 
design can be solved effciently by a set of Pareto optimal solutions using the  
Design of Nonlinear Stochastic Signal Processing Systems 171 
convex optimization method via an LMI-based MOEA search method with the 
help of the LMI toolbox in MATLAB. Unlike conventional EA search algorithms 
in SOPs, in order to minimize H2 and H∞ fltering performance simultaneously, 
the MOEA search is used for simultaneous optimization through a nondominated 
sorting scheme to avoid one dominating another in the reverse-order LMI-based 
MOEA search process. 
For a wider perspective, a reverse-order LMI-based MOEA method is devel￾oped to search for the set of Pareto optimal solutions for fuzzy flter gains via 
a number of genetic operators, such as selection, mutation, crossover, and cer￾tain processes. Next, one of the set of Pareto optimal solutions is selected for 
the fuzzy flter design, allowing the designer to achieve multi-objective H2/H∞ 
flter performance according to their own preference. Furthermore, for compari￾son, we suggest another multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design method based 
on the weighted sum scheme. The main purposes of this chapter are as follows: 
(1) A broader perspective to designing the MOP H2/H∞ fuzzy flter is provided for 
nonlinear stochastic T-S fuzzy systems, and it can actually be easily applied to 
other multi-objective flter design problems; (2) an indirect method is proposed 
to transform the complex MO H2/H flter design problem to a solvable LMI- ∞ 
constrained MOP; and (3) a reverse-order LMI-based MOEA through a nondom￾inated sorting scheme is developed to effciently solve the MO H2/H∞ fltering
problem with the help of the MATLAB LMI toolbox. 
This chapter is divided into fve sections as follows. In Section 8.2, the T-S fuzzy 
stochastic system is introduced to interpolate several local stochastic linear systems 
to approximate nonlinear stochastic signal processing, and the MO H2/H∞ fuzzy flter 
design problem is formulated as an MOP. In Section 8.3, the MOP of multi-objec￾tive H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design is indirectly formulated as an LMI-constrained MOP. 
In Section 8.4, the MOP of the multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design is solved 
using the proposed LMI-based MOEA. Finally, a simulation example regarding state 
estimation of a trajectory estimation of reentry vehicles by radar is given to illustrate 
the design procedure and confrm the performance of the proposed MO H2/H∞ fuzzy 
flter design in nonlinear systems.

8.2 SIGNAL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND PROBLEM 
FORMULATION 
The fltering problem in nonlinear discrete time signal processing systems with noisy 
measurements is depicted in Figure 8.1. The physical nonlinear signal processing 
system is represented using a T-S fuzzy model, and the output measurement y k( ) is 
corrupted by uncertain measurement noise n k( ). We model the whole signal process￾ing problem mathematically as follows. 172 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
 
 
FIGURE 8.1 The T-S fuzzy system represents a nonlinear discrete-time stochastic signal 
processing system with unavailable state variables, and a fuzzy flter is designed to estimate 
the state vector of the T-S fuzzy system. 
8.2.1 PhysICaL sIgnaL ProCessIng sysTem 
The physical signal system in Figure 8.1 is a nonlinear discrete-time signal process￾ing system that is represented by the stochastic T-S fuzzy model as follows [184, 185, 
188, 189, 194–197, 213]:

q() = q1 k q2 ( ),...,q p k [ ( ), k ( ) k ] is the measurable premise variable vector; and the driv- n m ing noise w k() Î R and measurement noise n k() Î R are all assumed to be an arbi￾trary signal in l2 [ , 0 ¥). The fuzzy basic functions are given by

where M ij( ( q j k)) represents the grade of membership of q ( ) k in the fuzzy set M p j ij, 
and it is assumed that Õ Mij( ( q j k)) ³ 0 for all k . In the following, for the sake of j=1 
brevity, we will drop the argument of hi( ( q k)). Therefore, we have hi( ( q k)) ³ 0 for 
i = 1 2, ,...,r and r hi å ( ( q k)) = 1. i=1

Design of Nonlinear Stochastic Signal Processing Systems 173 
A more compact presentation of the T-S discrete-time fuzzy model in (8.1) is given 
by [184, 185] as 
x k( + = 1) A h()() xk + B h( ) ( ) w k
y k() = C h()() xk + D()() hnk (8.2)
x k() = L h()( x k) 
where

D h() = r
h k D , Lh = r
å ( ( q )) () å h ( ( q k))L , h = (, h h ,...,h ) i=1 i i i=1 i i 1 2 r 
The physical explanation of the T-S fuzzy system in (8.1) or (8.2) is that r local 
linear discrete-time stochastic signal processing systems are interpolated by choos￾ing fuzzy basic functions with fuzzy rules to approximate a nonlinear stochastic sig￾nal system. Fuzzy parametersAi

identifed by the Linear Model Identifcation tool in MATLAB. 
8.2.2 fuzzy fILTer for sTaTe esTImaTIon 
In this study, we consider the following fuzzy flter to estimate z k( ) in (8.1) or (8.2): 
(1) Filter rule i: If q1 ( ) k is Mi1, q2 ( ) k is Mi2 . . . and q p ( ) k is Mip , then 
ˆ( + =) A x k + i xk 1 (() -C x k i ˆ() K yk i ˆ( )) (8.3) ˆ() = i zk L xˆ( ) k , i = 12 , ,..., r 
where x k ˆ() Î R is the state estimation, ˆ() Î R is the signal estimation, n z k q 
and Ki
 are flter gains to be determined. 
Thus, the fuzzy flter can be represented in the following form: 
x k ˆ( + = 1 ) A h( )x k ˆ() + K h( )( ( ) yk -C h( )xk ˆ( )) (8.4) zk ˆ() = L h( )xk ˆ( )
where K h() = år hi( ( q k))Ki . i=1 
(2) Filter error system: Based on the fuzzy dynamic system in (8.1) and (8.2) 
and the fuzzy flter system in (8.3) and (8.4), we can obtain the fltering 
estimation error system by subtracting (8.2) from (8.4) as follows: 
x k ˜( + = 1) [ ( Ah ) - K h( ) ( Ch )]x k ˜() +[ ( B h) 
éw k( )ù - K h() D h( )] (8.5) ê ú ë n k() û

}
where the state estimation error xk °() = xk () – x k ˆ( ), and the signal estima￾tion error °zk () () = z k – zˆ( ) k . 
The problem in flter design is to locate the flter gains such that the MO H2/H∞ flter￾ing performance on signal estimation error zk ˜() is guaranteed to achieve the optimal
mean-squares error and optimal flter robustness simultaneously. 
8.2.3 muLTI-objeCTIve H2/H∞ fuzzy fILTer desIgn 
Based on the fltering error system in (8.5), the design purpose in this chapter is 
described as follows. We wish to design fuzzy flter gains Ki
, i = 1,...,r in (8.3) and 
(8.4) such that the resulting H2 and H∞ fltering performance is minimized together, 
that is, denoting R1, R2 as the weighting factors: (1) The H2 fltering error covariance 
E z˜
T {( k + 1 )R z k ˜( +1)} 2 should be minimized to achieve the minimum mean square 
estimation error, and (2) the robust H∞ fltering performance

should be simultaneously minimized to achieve optimal fltering robustness. Conse￾quently, the MO H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design problem can be formulated as the follow￾ing MOP: 
min(J K( ), ( J K)) (8.6) 1 2 k 
where 
{å¥ T E z k=0 ˜ () k R1 z k ˜ ( )} () 1 ¥

JK = {åk=0 } T J2 () K = E{z k ˜ ( +1 ) R z2 ˜( 1 k + )} T = Tr E z{ ˜( k +1 ˜ 2 ( )R zk ( +1 ) })
and K = [K K, ,..., K ] denotes the set of fuzzy flter gains K in (8.3) or (8.4). 1 2 r i 
min J K( ), J K2 ( )) means to specify K to minimize J K( ) and J K( ) at the same K ( 1 1 2 
time. 
Remark 8.1: 
(1) At present, most MOPs focus on static systems [2, 77, 205, 210, 211], and 
they are not easily applied to solving the MOP in (8.6) directly for the 
nonlinear stochastic systems in (8.5). In the following section, an indirect 
approach is proposed to simplify the solving process of the MOP in (8.6) 
for multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design.

Design of Nonlinear Stochastic Signal Processing Systems 175 
(2) The conventional H2/H∞ flter designs [9, 34, 71, 200–202, 208] focused 
on the minimization of JK ∞ fltering performance 2 ( ) under a prescribed H 
J K() £ r for some given r , that is, the so-called mixed H2/H flter 1 ∞ 
design [9, 201, 202], which is actually an SOP with a given H∞ fltering 
performance constraint. For the multi-objective H2/H∞ fltering in (6), the 
H∞ fltering performance JK 2 1 ( ) and H fltering performance J K2 ( ) must 
be minimized simultaneously. Therefore, it is an MOP and different from 
the constrained SOP of the mixed H2/H∞ flter design. 
8.3 MULTI-OBJECTIVE H2/H∞ FUZZY FILTER DESIGN 
Based on the previous analysis, the multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design
problem requires solving the MOP in (8.6). Since it is very diffcult to solve the 
MOP in (8.6) directly for the nonlinear fuzzy stochastic flter error system in 
(8.5), an indirect method is proposed to minimize the upper bounds of these flter 
design objectives. In other words, we consider the following upper bounds to each 
objective: 
¥ T E z {å ˜ () k R z k ˜( ) k=0 { 1 }} J K1 () = £ a
{åk=0 
T k T E ( ) (k) } ¥
{w ( ) ( ) k w }+ n kn } (8.7) 
T J K2 () = Ez {˜ ( k +1 ) R2 z k ˜( +1) } £ b
for some positive scalar values a and b , respectively. Based on (8.6) and (8.7), the 
MOP for the multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design in (8.6) can be reformulated in 
the following solvable manner: 
min (a b, ) K (8.8) subject to 1 () £ a and 2 JK J K( ) £ b 
And we have the following lemma. 
Lemma 8.1: The MOP in (8.6) is equivalent to the MOP in (8.8). 
Proof: The proof of Lemma 8.1 is straightforward. One only needs to prove 
that both inequality constraints in problem (8.8) become equality for Pareto 
optimal solutions. We will show this by contradiction. Given a 3-tuple Pareto * * * optimal solution ( , K a b, ) of the MOP in (8.8), we assume that either inequal￾ity in (8.8) remains a strict inequality in the Pareto optimal solution. Without * loss of generality, suppose that J K( ) < a *
. As a result, there exists a such that 1 1 * * * a1 < a* and J K ) = a . Now, for the same K a b1 ) 1 ( 1 , the solution (, dominates 
the Pareto optimal solution ( , * * a b ) , leading to a contradiction. This implies
that both inequality constraints in MOP (8.8) indeed become equality for Pareto 
optimal solutions. The MOP in (8.8) is hence equivalent to the MOP described 
in (8.6). 176 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

Since we assume the statistics of w k( ) and n k( ) are uncertain, it is not easy to 
obtain the covariance E x{ ˜
T (k +1)R x k 2 ˜( +1)} in (8.11) for the H2 fltering perfor￾mance. In this situation, the covariance of the state estimation error is calculated T T based on unitary noise power (i.e., E w{ (k w) (k)} = I and E n{ (k n) (k)} = I) [9, 34, 
200–202]. If the nominal noise powers are available, we could consider the case of 
E w{ (k w) T (k)} = L and E n k nT 
1 k for some nominal L and L2 { ( ) ( )} = L2 1 instead of 
for unitary noise power. Therefore, the design of fuzzy flter gain K = [ , K K ,..., K ] 1 2 r 
will be solved for the MOP in (8.8) such that the two upper bounds a and b will 
be minimized simultaneously under the constraints in (8.10) and (8.11). Then, we 
obtain the following MOP for the multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design. 
Theorem 8.1: The MOP in (8.8) for multi-objective H2/H∞ flter design can be trans￾formed into the following MOP in (8.12)–(8.15), where M is the dimension of L h( ).

Since the MOP in (8.12)–(8.15) for MO H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design still contains 
fuzzy system matrices A h( ), B h( ), C h( ), D h( ), L h( ), and K h( ) in (8.2), it is still not 
easy to solve for flter gain K . By substituting these fuzzy matrices into the MOP 
in (8.12)–(8.15), we get the following main result for MO H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design. 
Theorem 8.2: The multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design becomes how to solve 
the following MOP in (8.16)–(8.19), for i j , = 1 2, ,...,r.

In general, it is still not easy to solve the MOP using bilinear matrix inequality 
constraints with the multiplication of P and Kj
 to be solved in (8.17) and (8.18). 
Fortunately, the BMIs in (8.17) and (8.18) can be reformulated as equivalent LMIs, 
which are easily solved using the LMI toolbox in MATLAB.

Therefore, the MOP with BMI constraints in (8.16)–(8.19) for MO H2/H∞ fuzzy 
flter design is equivalent to the following MOP with LMI constraints: 
( , * * ab ) = min ( , a b )
0,Z =[ Z1 ,...,Zr P> ] (8.22) 
subject to LMIs (8.19) - (8.21) 
where ( , * * a b ) denotes the minimum solutions of ( , a b ) in the previous MOP, that
is, the so-called Pareto optimal solutions. In general, Pareto optimal solutions are not 
unique. Therefore, there may exist many optimal solutions for ( , * * a b ) .
After solving the MOP in (8.22), the corresponding flter gains are obtained as 
* *-1 * * * Kj = P Zj and j = 12 , ,...,r , which correspond to the optimal solution (, a b ).
Remark 8.2: 
(1) If we solely consider H∞ fltering performance, then the MOP in (8.22) is 
reduced to the following SOP for H∞ fuzzy flter design [179–185] 
a0 = min a P>0,Z =[ Z ,...,Z ] 1 r (8.23) 
subject to (8.21)  
 
Design of Nonlinear Stochastic Signal Processing Systems 179 
(2) If we solely consider H2 filtering performance, then the MOP in (8.22) can be 
reduced to the following SOP for H2 fuzzy filter design [173]: 
b0 = min b >0,Z =[Z ,...,] P 1 Z r (8.24) 
subject to (8.19) and (8.20) 
(3) If conventional mixed H2/H∞ filter design is considered, then we need to solve 
the following constrained SOP for some prescribed noise attenuation level a 
of H∞ filtering [9, 34, 74, 198, 200–202, 194–197, 213]: 
b* = min b P>0,Z =[Z1 ,...,Zr ] (8.25) 
subject to (8.19) - (8.21) 
Remark 8.3: The LMI constraints of the MOP in (8.22) for MO H2/H∞ flter de￾sign are the same as the SOP in (8.25) for mixed H2/H∞ flter design. However, the 
optimal solution b* in (8.25) can be obtained more easily by decreasing b until no 
positive solution P > 0 is obtained for the LMIs in (8.19)–(8.21), while more time is 
needed to search for the simultaneous minimization ( , * * a b )in (8.22) via the MOEA
through a nondominated sorting scheme [2, 77, 205]. More detailed discussion about 
computational complexity will be given as follows. 
The SOP problem in (8.23) and (8.24) is termed an eigenvalue problem and can be 
easily solved by decreasing a or b with the help of the LMI optimization toolbox in 
MATLAB, as long as the no-solution case for P > 0 exists. In contrast to the SOPs 
in (8.23)–(8.25), the global optimal solution for the MOP in (8.22) may not exist. In 
other words, there exists no unique solution Z* 
j = PK* 
j such that a and b are mini￾mized simultaneously. Therefore, more effort is needed for the MOP in (8.22) to seek 
a set of Pareto optimal solutions [2, 77, 205]. Before we further analyze the MOP in 
(8.22), we introduce the weighted sum method for the MOP with some given weight￾ings w1 or w2 . The weighted sum method has been applied to solve the MO problem. 
This technique converts the MOP to an SOP by emphasizing one optimal solution of 
the weighted sum, that is, how to minimize w1
a + w2 b for some weightings w1 and 
w2 . Based on the weighted sum method, the MOP for multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy 
flter design in (8.22) can be transformed into an SOP by choosing fuzzy flter gain 
Kj
 to minimize w1
a + w2 b with w1 + w2 = 1. We then obtain the following result: 
Theorem 8.3: The multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy flter for fuzzy signal systems in 
(8.1) can be solved by the following weighted method for all w1 ³ 0, w2 ³ 0, and 
w1 + w2 = 1 
min w1
a + w2 b P>0,Z =[ Z1 ,...,Zr ] (8.26) 
subject to LMIs (8.19), (8.20) and (8.21) 180 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
 
  
 
Proof: Using the weighted sum w1
a + w2 b to replace ( , a b ) and as in the proof 
of the indirect method in Appendix 8.7.1, we can easily prove Theorem 8.3 by fol￾lowing a similar argument to that used in proving Theorems 8.1 and 8.2. We omit the 
detailed procedure here. 
The MOP in (8.26) is referred to as the weighted-sum SOP for MO H2/H∞ fuzzy 
flter design. It is different from fnding Pareto optimal solutions for the MOP in 
(8.22) in one single run. To locate different Pareto optimal solutions, we need to 
apply different weightings to the SOP in (8.26) several times for different weighted 
sum solutions. How to choose the weightings w1 and w2 , however, is another design 
problem, especially when a and b in (8.26) are in different scales. 
Based on the previous analysis, we will combine the LMI technique from the LMI 
toolbox with the MOEA [212] to solve the LMI-constrained MOP in (8.22) or the 
weighted sum method in (8.26). In the following section, we frst introduce some 
key notions for solving the LMI-constrained MOP in (8.22), such as dominance and 
Pareto fronts [2, 77, 205]. 
Remark 8.4: To fnd the feasible set for a and b , additional notation is used: a , 
b are denoted as the upper bounds on a and b , respectively, and a0 in (8.23) and b0 
in (8.24) are denoted as the lower bounds on a and b , respectively (i.e., a0 £ £ a a 
and b0 £ £ b b ). 
8.4 MULTI-OBJECTIVE H2/H∞ FUZZY FILTER DESIGN 
VIA THE LINEAR MATRIX INEQUALITY–BASED 
MULTI-OBJECTIVE EVOLUTION ALGORITHM 
The Pareto optimal solutions we want to fnd in the MOP are a set of solutions that 
are nondominated with respect to each other [77]. Before solving the MOP in (8.22) 
for the Pareto optimal solutions of the multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy flter, some key 
notions for the MOP are introduced as follows. 
8.4.1 PareTo domInanCe reLaTIon In The muLTI￾objeCTIve oPTImIzaTIon ProbLem 
For simplicity of the ensuing derivation, the LMI-constrained MOP in (8.22) is 
abstractly formulated as 
min (a b, )
{ , P Z}ÎW (8.27) 
subject to LMIs (8.19), (8.20) and (8.21) 
where W represents the feasible set in which the element of W must be satisfed with 
the LMIs in (8.19), (8.20), and (8.21). Since we want to search for some P and Z to 
minimize a and b simultaneously, three defnitions for the solutions of the MOP in 
(8.27) are provided to guarantee the domination of candidate solutions ( , a b ) in the 
search process as follows: 
Pareto dominance: For two solutions (, P Z ) and (, P Z ) in W for two objec- 1 1 2 2 
tive values ( , 1 and ( , 2 a b subject to the LMIs in (8.19), (8.20), and 1 ) a b2 )  
 
Design of Nonlinear Stochastic Signal Processing Systems 181 
(8.21), respectively, ( , P Z ) is said to dominate ( , P Z ) if a £ a and 1 1 2 2 1 2 
b1 £ b2 for at least one inequality being a strict inequality. 
Pareto optimality: A solution ( , * * with objective value ( , * * P Z ) a b )is said to 
be a Pareto optimal solution of (8.27) if there does not exist another feasible 
solution ( , P Z ) with objective value ( , a b ) such that the objective value 1 1 1 1 
( , 1 1 a b ) dominates ( , a b ). * * 
Pareto front: For the MOP in (8.27), the Pareto front PF*
 defned as * * * * * * PF = {(a b, ) (, PZ )} is a Pareto optimal solution, and (, a b )
* is gen￾erated by ( , * * P Z )subject to the LMIs in (8.19)–(8.21). 
Based on these key notions, a reverse-order LMI-based MOEA is proposed to solve 
the MO H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design problem in (8.27). Since the LMI technique can 
transform the flter design problem into a convex optimization problem, it has been 
widely applied to solve the SOP of flter design. But for the MOP in (8.27), the LMI 
technique cannot solve the MOP directly. Hence, the LMI technique is combined with 
the MOEA to deal with the MOP in (8.27) for the H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design problem.

An MOEA is a stochastic search method through nondominated sorting scheme 
based on the mechanism of natural selection [2, 77, 205, 214]. It is also particularly 
suitable to multi-objective optimization due to its population-based nature, which 
allows a set of Pareto optimal solutions to be obtained in a single run. At present, 
a number of MOEAs have been proposed to solve MOPs with simple algebraic 
constraints [2, 77, 205]. In the case of MO H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design, we propose 
an LMI-based MOEA to solve the MOP in (8.27). Some important steps for LMI￾based MOEAs and some characteristics of Pareto optimal solutions of MOPs are 
introduced as follows. 
Traditional MOEAs randomly select candidate chromosomes (solutions) from the 
feasible region as the initial population. Therefore, the LMI constraints in (8.19)– 
(8.21) should be involved in the traditional MOEA. First, a number of chromosomes 
will be randomly generated from the feasible region. Next, in order to ensure some 
of these chromosomes (solutions) are feasible for the MOP in (8.22), each feasible 
chromosome will be checked by the existence of a positive defnite solution of P 
per the LMIs in (8.19)–(8.21) via the LMI toolbox in MATLAB. If certain candidate 
solutions (or chromosomes) cannot guarantee positively defned solutions, that is, 
P > 0, they should be deleted from these candidate chromosomes. After this pro￾cess, the remaining chromosomes can be regarded as the initial population for the 
MOP (8.22). Note that the three LMIs in (8.19)–(8.21) set more constraints than 
traditional methods on the evolutionary search for feasible initial chromosomes. 
Moreover, the LMI toolbox in MATLAB can help effciently check whether these 
chromosomes satisfy the LMIs in (8.19)–(8.21) to accelerate the selection speed of 
the initial population. 182 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
 
 
 
Based on the previous analysis, the detailed design procedure of reverse-order 
LMI-based MOEA for the multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy flter problem in (8.22) is 
proposed as follows: 
8.4.3 desIgn ProCedure 
Step 1: Select the feasible range for prescribed attenuation level a , b , the 
maximum number of generations, the total population size, the crossover 
ratio, and the mutation ratio in the MOEA. 
Step 2: Initialize a number of chromosomes (solutions) and consider those 
chromosomes satisfed under the LMI constraints in (8.19)–(8.21) as the 
initial population. 
Step 3: Evaluate objectives ai
 and bi of the current population. Additionally 
sort the current population into different fronts and assign a ftness value 
and then a rank of nondomination to each individual ( ,i i a b ) .
Step 4: Select half of the current population through nondominated sorting 
method as the parent population based on the rank and ftness value of each 
individual ( ,i a b . i) 
Step 5: Perform crossover and mutation operations of the parent population, 
and check the three LMIs in (8.19)–(8.21) to construct feasible offspring for 
the MOP in (8.22). 
Step 6: Combine the parent population with offspring and perform step 4 to 
select individuals according to their rank and ftness value until the popula￾tion size reaches the total population size. A new generation is thus created 
for the Pareto optimal solution search. 
Step 7: Repeat steps 4, 5, 6, and 7 until the maximum number of generations 
is reached. 
Step 8: Obtain Z = [Z Z Z ] by solving P > 0 and Zj , ,..., , j = 1,...,r from the 1 2 r 
LMIs in (8.19), (8.20), and (8.21) for each chromosome of the last popula￾tions at the maximum number of generations and obtain the corresponding 
fuzzy flter gain K = P Z for all j in (8.3) and K h() = h ( ( q k))K in j j i i 
-1 år
i-1 
(8.4). After fnishing this LMI-based MOEA procedure, the Pareto optimal 
solutions will be obtained for the MO H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design problem in 
(8.16)–(8.19). 
Remark 8.5: 
(1) In the previous LMI-based MOEA design procedure, individuals with 
a high rank of nondomination have more copies than other individuals, 
which causes the elitist characteristic in the MOEA and allows better con￾vergence to the Pareto optimal solutions of (8.27). 
(2) The computation complexities of the proposed LMI-based MOEA are 
about O r( ( n n +1)MN2
), including O r( ( n n +12 )/ ) in solving LMIs, and 
O M2 N2 ( ) in the MOEA, where n is the dimension of P, N is the popula￾tion number of the MOEA, r is the number of fuzzy rules, and M is the 
generation number of the MOEA.

8.5 SIMULATION EXAMPLES 
To illustrate the design process and demonstrate the performance of the MO H2/H∞ 
fuzzy flter, we provide the simulation example. We use the proposed evolutionary 
search algorithm to search a set of Pareto optimal solutions ( , * * ab ) to solve the
MOP in (8.22) for the multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy flter design problem. We choose 
a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) [2] as an MOEA search due 
to its popularity and combine it with the LMI toolbox in MATLAB to locate Pareto 
optimal solutions for the MOP in (8.22). The simulation settings for the evolution 
search algorithm in the design procedure are as follows: population size N = 50, gen￾eration number M = 50, crossover ratio Pc = 0 9. , and mutation ratio Pm = 0 0. 1. They 
were chosen for the modifed NSGA-II. The corresponding Pareto optimal solutions 
P*
 and Z* 
j for j = 1 2, ,...,16 are also solved by the LMIs in (19)–(21). Next, the cor- * *-1 * responding flter gains in (8.3) are also obtained as Kj = P Zj for j = 1 2, ,...,16. 
Example: The six-degrees-of-freedom reentry vehicle fies for several hundred 
kilometers along a ballistic trajectory above the rotating earth. The estimation of a 
reentry vehicle trajectory plays an important role in target tracking systems. A trajec￾tory estimation of reentry vehicles (RVs) by radar is depicted in Figure 8.2. The RV 
model in radar coordinates (, O X , , Y Z ) centered at the radar site can be expressed R R R R 
as follows [215, 216]:

8.6 CONCLUSION 
In this chapter, we introduced an MO fuzzy H2/H∞ flter design for the state estima￾tion of fuzzy systems for stochastic nonlinear systems. The proposed multi-objective 
flter design takes advantage of the compromise between the optimal H2 and H∞ fl￾tering design. Due to the conficting objectives, the Pareto front representation for 
MOP H2/H∞ optimal solutions can be considered compromise solutions of the optimal 
H2/H∞ fltering design in the objective function space based on the MO optimization 
method for nonlinear fuzzy stochastic systems. An indirect method is introduced for 
solving the MOP of the multi-objective H2/H∞ flter under a set of BMI constraints in 
the sense of minimizing the upper bounds of both the H∞ and H2 flter performance 
simultaneously. To deal with the BMI-constrained MOP, a simple LMI-constrained 
MOP is proposed to replace the BMI-constrained MOP to simplify the MO H2/H∞ 
flter design as an LMI-constrained MOP. Because of the convex property of the LMI￾based MOEA, the MOP for multi-objective fuzzy H2/H flter design can be eff- ∞ 
ciently solved. Unlike conventional MOPs for algebraic systems, the proposed design 
method for MO H2/H∞ flter design for stochastic nonlinear dynamic systems is novel 
and suitable for practical applications. Furthermore, the proposed MO H2/H∞ flter 
design method can be easily extended to other MO H2/H∞ flter design problems, such 
as MO l2/H∞ flter design. Simulation examples demonstrate that multi-objective opti￾mal fltering performance can be achieved using the proposed method.

The proof is divided into these steps: 
In the frst step, we show that H∞ performance in (8.10) can be converted into the 
inequality in (8.13); that is, if the inequality in (8.13) holds for a , then H∞ perfor￾mance has an upper bound a . The second step is then to show that H2 performance 
in (8.11) has an upper bound b if (8.14) and (8.15) both hold. The third step is to 
show that the multi-objective problem in (8.8) is equivalent to solving the MOP in 
(8.12)–(8.15).

Attack via Multi-Objective 
Estimation Method 
9.1 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, robust H∞ flter techniques have played an important role in many 
application felds such as image processing, industry engineering, and signal pro￾cessing [217, 218]. In real situations, external disturbance and measurement noise 
are unavailable for designers, and these effects are inevitable during the industrial 
process. Hence, the robust H∞ flter is employed to detect and estimate the signal 
when the transmitted signal is infuenced by external disturbance or measurement 
noise [217, 218]. In contrast to other flter design schemes, such as the particle flter 
(PF) [219, 220] or H2 flter [221, 222], one of the advantages of the robust H∞ flter 
is that it is not necessary to know the exact statistical characteristics of the external 
disturbance and measurement noise. Thus, the robust H∞ flter is suitable to deal with 
the estimation of transmitted signals that suffer from uncertain external disturbance 
and measurement noise. The robust H∞ fltering problem has been investigated for a 
variety of dynamic systems such as nonlinear network systems [223], Markov jump￾ing linear systems [224], uncertain nonlinear systems [225], and fuzzy model–based 
nonlinear systems [226]. 
In order to make flter design for signal transmission systems more practical, 
robust flter designs for stochastic nonlinear systems have been discussed in recent 
years [10, 223, 227, 228]. Some practical applications have considered the stochastic 
effects on system models in many felds, such as engineering, biology, fnance, and 
economics [11, 29, 34, 188, 229–231]. Further, the discontinuous (jump) Poisson 
process has also gained increasing attention in recent years [129, 130, 232, 233]. The 
Poisson process could be captured as event-driven uncertainties, such as corporate 
defaults, operational failures, or insured events [10, 129, 130, 224, 231–234]. There￾fore, a stochastic system with continuous Wiener fuctuation and discontinuous Pois￾son fuctuation has been utilized to describe intrinsic continuous and discontinuous 
random fuctuation of signal processing in the transmission system [10, 217, 223, 
227, 228, 235–237]. By using the Itô-Lévy stochastic differential equations, the sto￾chastic properties of continuous and discontinuous random fuctuation in stochastic 
systems could be explicitly expressed for further design consideration.  
Security-Enhanced Filter Design for Systems under Attack 193 
Recently, due to the rapid development of communication networks and smart 
devices, the Internet is widely used for many services, such as information retrieval, 
video streaming, fle sharing, online shopping, banking, and social networking. The 
Internet of Things framework connects many devices that can communicate and 
share information to achieve common goals in many felds. Although the IoT has 
profoundly changed our lives, it generates many issues to be further considered, such 
as energy challenges [238–240], effectiveness [241], reliability [242], security, and 
privacy [243–245]. From the security perspective, the IoT may suffer from active 
attacks when signals or data are transmitted. The topic of security attacks has been 
investigated during the past decade [246–248]. 
Owing to the complicated network of the IoT, which persistently transmits sig￾nals or data through the Internet, robust flter design only considering the effect of 
external disturbances and measurement noise is insuffcient. Active malicious attack 
signals usually target the potential weak points of the system and disrupt transmitted 
information so that fuent transmission is interrupted. There are several kinds of the 
active malicious attacks, such as the well-known denial of service (DoS), jamming, 
and false data injection (FDI) [249]. The attackers aim to interrupt the transmitted 
signal and make systems vulnerable to malicious attacks. As a result, the topic of 
malicious attack signals is an urgent issue for future transmission systems. Recently, 
descriptor flters based on the singular descriptor model have been widely utilized 
to deal with the estimation of malicious attacks [247, 248, 250–253]. In general, by 
using the descriptor flter method, the singularity may have serious effects on the 
descriptor flter of a transmission system like instability or breakdown if strict alge￾braic conditions are not satisfed during the design. 
In general, most transmission systems have strongly nonlinear behavior. Thus, the 
flter design problem for nonlinear systems will be transformed into a Hamilton-Jac￾obi inequality–constrained optimization problem. It is well known that the HJI is a 
partial differential inequality, and it will increase the diffculty in the analysis and 
design of nonlinear flters. In contrast to solving the linear matrix inequality–con￾strained optimization problem for flter design of the linear stochastic system case, the 
HJI-constrained optimization problem for flter design of nonlinear stochastic systems 
is still diffcult to analyze. Therefore, global linearization technology was employed 
to effciently treat the flter design of nonlinear systems. By using global linearization 
technology, nonlinear systems could be interpolated by several local linearized sys￾tems at the vertices of the polytope of global linearization systems [254, 255]. In this 
situation, the HJI-constrained optimization problem for flter design of the nonlinear 
system could be transformed into an LMI-constrained optimization problem. 
Since the H2 optimal flter cannot attenuate the effect of external disturbance, for 
practical applications, the robust H∞ flter design problem is also an important issue 
to be addressed by researchers, for example, a robust H∞ flter for a class of nonlinear 
stochastic systems [10, 29, 217, 223, 226, 230, 234]. Nevertheless, designers intend 
flter design to be not only robust but also optimal. By integrating the advantages of 
both H∞ and H2 flters, a mixed H2/H∞ flter design has been proposed in [7, 34, 255]. 
The concept of mixed H2/H∞ flter design aims to minimize the H2 flter performance 
index under a prescribed H∞ flter performance level, that is, a single-objective opti￾mization problem. By extending the mixed H2/H∞ flter design, the MO concept has 194 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
 
 
been utilized for flter design. MO H2/H∞ flter design could achieve both optimal H∞ 
robust flter performance and optimal H2 flter performance simultaneously. 
By the previous analysis, the security-enhanced flter (SEF) is designed for lin￾ear and nonlinear stochastic jump-diffusion systems with external disturbances as 
well as malicious attacks on the system and sensors that may corrupt the system 
state and output measurement simultaneously. A novel smoothed signal model is 
proposed to effciently describe malicious attack signals. To simplify the design, the 
smoothed signal model of malicious attack signals is embedded in the stochastic 
system model as an augmented stochastic system. Unlike conventional complicated 
descriptor-based flters to deal with the estimation of malicious attack signals by iso￾lating the singularity of the descriptor system, we can effciently estimate the system 
state and malicious signals directly from the state estimation of the augmented sto￾chastic system by the traditional Luenberger-type flter. In this situation, malicious 
signals are embedded in the augmented system and will not corrupt the state estima￾tion of the augmented stochastic system again. The SEF design based on the pro￾posed stochastic MO H2/H∞ fltering performance is introduced for the augmented 
stochastic system with effcient attenuation on the effect of external disturbance and 
measurement noise to achieve optimal stochastic H2 and H∞ state and malicious 
attack signal estimation simultaneously. Since the stochastic MO H2/H∞ SEF design 
problem cannot be solved directly, a suboptimal method is proposed to transform the 
stochastic MO H2/H∞ SEF design problem into an LMI-constrained MOP. Further, 
in the case of nonlinear stochastic systems, global linearization technology [19, 254] 
is employed to interpolate the HJI-constrained MOP for MO H2/H∞ SEF by a set of 
LMI-constrained MOPs at the vertices of the polytope of the global linearization sys￾tems. A reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA is also proposed to effciently solve 
the LMI-constrained MOP for MO H2/H∞ SEF design of stochastic jump-diffusion 
systems under malicious attack signals. Two simulation examples are provided to 
validate the effectiveness of the stochastic MO H2/H∞ SEF method. A radar system 
for trajectory estimation of a nonlinear stochastic incoming ballistic missile with 
external disturbance, measurement noise, and malicious attack signals is given in 
the frst example. In the second example, a network-based mass-spring system is 
provided to compare the effectiveness between the proposed security-enhanced flter 
design, our method, and other fault estimation flter design methods. 
The purposes of this chapter are as follows: 
(1) To remedy the conventional designs of complex descriptor flter based on 
a singular descriptor model [246–248, 250–253], a novel smoothed signal 
model is proposed to effciently describe the dynamic of malicious attack 
signals on system and sensor. Then a simple traditional Luenberger-type 
flter can be employed to effciently estimate the system states and mali￾cious attack signals to achieve the MO H2/H∞ SEF design for the stochastic 
jump-diffusion system. Hence, the proposed MO H2/H∞ SEF design can 
achieve optimal H2 security fltering and H∞ performance on attenuating 
the effect of external disturbance and measurement noise simultaneously. 
(2) Since the HJI-constrained MOP for nonlinear MO H2/H∞ SEF is not 
easy to solve directly by the existing analytical or numerical methods, the  
     
 
 
Security-Enhanced Filter Design for Systems under Attack 195 
global linearization method is employed to transform the HJI-constrained 
MOP to an LMI-constrained MOP. Thus, the stochastic SEF design can be 
simply implemented for practical applications. 
(3) In general, the LMI-constrained MOP is not easy to solve by conventional 
MOEAs directly. An LMI-constrained MOEA is also proposed to effciently 
solve the LMI-constrained MOP for SEF design of the stochastic jump-diffu￾sion system under malicious attack signals with the help of the LMI toolbox. 
This chapter is divided into six sections as follows: The linear stochastic jump￾diffusion system and the signal smoothed model are introduced in Section 9.2. In the 
Section 9.3, the linear MO H2/H∞ SEF design problem is formulated as an MOP, and a 
suboptimal method is proposed to transform the MO H2/H∞ SEF design problem to an 
LMI-constrained MOP. In Section 9.4, the nonlinear MO H2/H∞ SEF design problem is 
formulated as an HJI-constrained MOP and then transformed into an LMI-constrained 
MOP by using the global linearization scheme. Two simulation examples, the esti￾mation of incoming ballistic missiles and a network-based mass-spring system, are 
provided in Section 9.5 to illustrate the design procedure and validate the performance 
of the proposed method. Finally, this is followed by concluding remarks in Section 9.6.

Consider the following continuous-time linear stochastic jump diffusion system with 
external disturbance and malicious attack signals on system components and sensors: 
dx() t = ( ( Axt ) + B v(t B ) + ft ( )) dt + Gx() td w t( ) d a a 
+ Jx( )t( dp t ) (9.1) 
y t() = Cx() t + B n t() + B f ( )t n s s 
n m n where n x t() Î ° is the state vector; y t() Î ° is the measurement output; v t() Î ° a s is the measurement noise; and f t() Î ° and f t() Î ° are the malicious attack a s 
signals on the system and sensors, respectively. They could corrupt the system state 
and sensor measurement output, respectively, and are to be detected. w t() Î ° is a 
standard 1-D Wiener process, and p t() Î ° is a Poisson counting process with inten￾sity l. The system matrices A B, , d B G, , J C,, Bn , and B in (9.1) have the appropriate a s 
dimensions. 196 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

Assumption 9.1: The continuous-time linear stochastic jump diffusion system 
in (9.1) is observable; that is, the pair ( , A C) is observable. 
Assumption 9.2: The malicious attack signals f t( ) and f t( ) in the stochastic a s 
jump diffusion system in (9.1) are differentiable; that is, f t( ) and f t( ) a s 
exist. 
In the linear stochastic jump-diffusion system in (9.1), the diffusion term Gx() td wt ( )
denotes continuous but nondifferentiable random fuctuation, and the jumping term 
Jx() t dp t( ) denotes discontinuous random fuctuation. The Wiener process w t( ) and 
Poisson counting process p t( ) are defned on the complete fltered probability space 
( , W ,{ } ° ³0
F F , P), where W denotes the sample space, σ-feld F is generated by the t tÎ t 
Wiener process w s( ) and Poisson counting process ps ( ) for s t < , F = Èt³0 Ft , and P
is the probability measure. The Wiener process w t( ) and Poisson counting process 
p t( ) are assumed to be mutually independent. Some important properties of Wiener 
process and Poisson counting process are given as follows [10]: 
1) [ E w( )t ] = E dw t [ ( )] = 0
2 2) [ E dw t( )] = dt 
(9.2) 3) [ E dp t( )] = ldt 
4) [ E dw t() dp t( )] = 0 
Remark 9.1: In future cyber-physical systems, the system integrates computa￾tional computers, a communication network, and physical components. This fact 
implies the system will not only suffer from the effects of external disturbance 
on physical components but also receive malicious attack signals from the com￾munication network. Among the several types of malicious attack signals, com￾mon malicious attack signals include a large block function and high-frequency 
periodic function. In particular, the large block function aims to break down the 
system and lead to undesired operation. On the other hand, the high-frequency 
periodic function in a communication network is used to attack the estimation of 
the sensor. 
Since the system dynamic and the sensor output suffer from the malicious attack 
signals f t( ) and f t( ), respectively, it may lead to system performance degradation a s 
and even system breakdown. In order to solve this security fltering problem, a novel 
smoothed signal model is proposed to help flter and estimate the malicious attack sig￾nal effciently. Since the derivative and right derivative are equivalent for a differen￾tiable function, by Assumption 9.2, a smoothed signal model of the malicious attack 
f t( h) f a + - ( )t a signal can be constructed based on the right derivative of ˛ ft () = lim a h®0+ h 
as follows: 
˛ 1 f t() = ( f t( + h) - f ( t )) +x ( )t a h a a 1,a 
˛ 1 f t a ( - h) = h f t - fa (t h)) +x a ( ( ) - ( )t a 2, (9.3)  
˛ 1 f t a - - ) ) ft kh x +1,a f t ( )t a ( - kh) = h (( (k 1 h - a ( - )) + k I

where h > 0 is a small enough time interval, x ( )t ,...,x ( )t denotes the corre- 1,a k+1,a 
sponding approximation errors of derivative at different smoothed time points, and 
f t() = x t( ) for -kh £ £ t 0 with unknown continuous function x t( ). Further, the a a a 
malicious attack signal ft ( + h) could be represented by extrapolation (for example, a 
Lagrange extrapolation [256]) as follows: 
k 
ft ( + h) = åa f ( t i - h) +t () t (9.4) a i a a 
i=0 
where { }k a are the extrapolation coeffcients, and t ( )t represents the extrapolation i i=0 a 
error of ft ( + h). Then,= the smoothed signal model of the malicious attack signal a 
f t( ) in (9.1) could be written as follows: a 
F t ˛ () = A F ( )t +x ( )t (9.5) a a a a 
T T T T f tf t h ( - h a [( where F t 1,a () = [ ( ), ( - ),..., f t k )] , the error vector x ( )t = x ( )t + a a a a 
T T T T t ( )t ), x ( )t ,..., x ( )t ] , and the smoothed matrix a 2,a k+1,a

where a0 = a0 -1. 
Remark 9.2: Since the malicious attack signal is unavailable for the design, it is 
not easy to fnd a set of fxed parameters { }k a to exactly extrapolate the malicious i i=0 
function at a future sample point by the conventional Lagrange extrapolation. In 
general, the conventional Lagrange extrapolation needs time-varying extrapolation 
coeffcients { (t)}k a for the extrapolation, and it will make the flter design more i i=0 
complex. In this study, a modifed Lagrange extrapolation method, that is, the pro￾posed smoothed signal model with fxed extrapolation coeffcients { }k a , is pro- i i=0 
posed to simplify the design procedure. Since the extrapolation error is considered 
in (9.4), the smoothed signal model in (9.4) is able to extrapolate the value of the 
malicious function at a future sample point by the current and previous values of 
malicious functions as possible. In general, due to the continuity of the malicious 
signal, it is expected that the value of the malicious function at a future sample point 
is closer to the value of the current sample point under a small sample period h > 0. 
Thus, the extrapolation parameters { }k a should be chosen as a positive decreasing i i=0 
sequence, and the parameter a0 is close but not equal to 1; that is, a ³ a ³ 0 for i i+1 
i = 0,..., k -1 and k å ai = 1. i=0 198 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

Similarly, the smoothed signal model of the malicious attack signal f t( ) can be s 
constructed as: 
˛ 1 f t() = ( ( ft + - h) ( f t )) +x ( )t s h s s 1,s 
˛ 1 ft ( ) - = h ( ( f t) - f ( th - )) +x ( )t s h s s 2,s (9.6)  
˛ 1 ft ( - kh ) = (( ft - - ( 1 k ) ) h - ft ( - kh )) +x ( )t s h s s k+1,s 
where x ( )t ,...,x ( )t denote the approximation errors of derivative at different 1,s k+1,s 
smoothed time points, and f t = x t() kh t 0, with unknown continuous s () s for - £ £ 
function x t( ). Further, the malicious attack signal ft h) s s ( + can be represented by 
extrapolation as follows: 
k 
ft ( + h) = åb f ( t i - h) +t ( )t (9.7) s i s s 
i=0 
where { }k b are the extrapolation coeffcients, and t () t represents the extrapolation i i=0 s 
error of ft + h). s ( 
Then, the smoothed signal model of the malicious attack signal on the sensor in 
(9.1) is given as follows: 
F t ˛ () = A F ( )t +x ( )t (9.8) s s s s 
T T T T where F t() = [ ( f tf t ), ( - h ),..., f ( t k - h)] , the error vector s s s s x ( )t = [(x ( )t s 1,s

where b = b -1. Then, the augmented system is proposed to include the smoothed 0 0 
signal models (9.5) and (9.8) of malicious attack signals on the system and sensor 
in (9.1): 
dx( )t = (Ax( ) t + Bv( t d )) t + Gx( )t t dw() + Jx( )t dp( )t

D = [0 Bn 0 0]. Because the augmented state includes the malicious attack sig￾nal on the system and sensor for the flter design, we will estimate x() t directly, and 
the augmented state x( )t needs to be observable. Hence, the following theorem is 
proposed to guarantee the observability of the augmented state in (9.9). 
Theorem 9.1: For the continuous-time linear stochastic jump diffusion system in

where C is the set of one dimensional complex number, then ( , A C) in the augmented 
system in (9.9) is observable. 
Proof: Please refer to Appendix 9.7.1. 
After the observability of the augmented system in (9.9) is guaranteed, the follow￾ing linear Luenberger-type flter is employed to estimate the system state in (9.9), 
which includes state variables and malicious attack signals: 
dx t = (Aˆ() + L yt - ˆ( )))dt ˆ() x t ( ( ) yt (9.15) 
yt ˆ() = Cx t ˆ() 200 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
 
 
where L is the flter gain to be designed, and ˆ
x() t and y t ˆ( )Î are the estimated state 
and the estimated measurement output, respectively. 
Remark 9.3: If we estimate the state x t( ) in (9.1) by Luenberger-type flter 
directly, the estimated x t ˆ( ) could be corrupted by attacked signals f t( ) and f t( ). a s 
However, for the augmented system in (9.9), f t( ) and f t( ) are embedded in x( )t , a s 
and we could estimate state and malicious attack signals by x( )t ; that is, x() t is only 
with the corruption of v( )t and without the corruption of malicious attack signals 
f t( ) and f t( ) again. Therefore, we could design an SEF by estimating the state of a s 
the augmented system in (9.9) by the Luenberger-type flter in (9.15). 
9.2.2 ProbLem formuLaTIon 
In this study, the estimation ofx t( ), f t( ) and f t( ), that is, x( )t in (9.9), by the Luen- a s 
berger-type flter in (9.15) still needs to effciently attenuate the effect of v( )t by 
H∞ fltering performance and achieve optimal fltering performance under random 
fuctuation due to w t( ) and p t( ) by H2 fltering performance. In order to optimally 
estimate the state and malicious attack signals in (9.10), based on the augmented 
system in (9.9) without considering v( )t , the following the stochastic H2 fltering 
performance of the Luenberger-type flter in (9.15) is introduced [221, 222]: 
ò
tf H L = E ˆ ˆ () (x(t) x( )tQ ) x t T – ( ( ) – x( )t )dt (9.16) 2 2 0 
where Q2 ³ 0 denotes the weighting matrix on estimation error, and tf denotes the 
terminal time. In (9.16), the design objective is to fnd a specifc flter gain L to 
achieve the optimal H2 security-enhanced fltering performance. 
On the other hand, since the augmented disturbance v() t is unpredictable for the 
stochastic jump diffusion system (9.9), the stochastic robust H∞ fltering performance 
is proposed to reduce the effect of the augmented disturbance v( )t on the estimation 
error as follows [223, 224]:

where Q¥ ³ 0 denotes the weighting matrix on the estimation error, 
n + + +1 as E x[ ( ) (˜ )] v = nv nn (k )( + ), and the term - ˜
T 0 Px 0 deletes the effect of the 
initial condition on the robust H∞ fltering performance with positive matrix P > 0 D 
and °x( ) 0 = x( ) 0 - x( ) 0 . In (9.17), we aim to fnd a flter gain L in (9.15) to attenuate 
the worst-case effect of the augmented disturbance v( )t in (9.9) on the estimation 
error to achieve stochastic robust H∞ fltering performance.  
 
Security-Enhanced Filter Design for Systems under Attack 201 
Remark 9.4: Since the extrapolation errors t a ( )t and t s ( )t in (9.4) and (9.7) are 
unavailable and it will infuence on the estimation performance, the worst-case effect 
of extrapolation errors t a ( )t and t s ( )t in (17) should be attenuated to be as small as 
possible. From the theoretical point of view, the extrapolation errors t a ( )t and t s ( )t 
can be reduced by (i) increasing the sampling point k , (ii) decreasing the sampling 
period h, and (iii) selecting appropriate parameters { }k a . Further, the worst-case i i=0 
effect of extrapolation errors is considered in the robust H∞ flter design in (9.17). 
Thus, the proposed MO H2/H∞ SEF can effciently attenuate the effect of extrapola￾tion errors during the fltering process. 
In order to achieve stochastic optimal H∞ robust fltering performance and H2 flter￾ing performance simultaneously, the MO H2/H∞ SEF design of a stochastic system with 
external disturbance and malicious attack signals in (9.10) is formulated as follows: 
min( 2 ( ), ¥ H L HL ( )) s.t .. (9 9),( 9 1. 5 ) (9.17) L

following for convenience of design:

the stochastic H2 fltering performance in (9.16) and the stochastic robust H∞ fltering 
performance in (9.17) can be reformulated as follows:

Therefore, the MO H2/H∞ SEF design problem in (9.18) for the stochastic augmented 
jump-diffusion system in (9.19) is reformulated as follows: 
min( 2 ( ), ¥ H L HL ( )) s.t. . (9 19) (9.22) L 
In general, it is not easy to solve this MOP directly. Thus, a suboptimal method is 
proposed to solve the MOP indirectly by minimizing the upper bounds as follows: 
( , * * ab ) m= in( , ab ) (9.23) L 
s.t. (9.19), H L() £ a and H L() £ b (9.24) 2 ¥ 
Before solving MOP in (9.23) and (9.24), some fundamental properties of the MOP 
are introduced as follows: 
Property 9.1 (Pareto Dominance [7, 11]): For two feasible solutions L1
 and L2 
of flter gain in (9.15) with the corresponding objective values ( , 1 1 a b ) and 2 2 ( , a b ) of the MOP in (9.23), respectively, the solution L1
 is said to domi￾nate L2
 if and only if a1 £ a2
 and b1 £ b2
 and at least one of the inequalities 
is a strict inequality. 
Property 9.2 (Pareto Optimality [7, 11]): The feasible solution L*
 with the 
objective vector ( , * * a b )of the MOP in (9.23) is said the Pareto optimality 
with respect to the feasible solution set if and only if there does not exist 
another feasible solution that dominates it. 
Property 3 (Pareto Optimal set [7, 11]): For the MOP in (9.23) with feasible 
solution L and the corresponding objective vector ( , a b ), the Pareto opti- * * * mal solution set s is defned as s ˇ {L L* and is of Pareto optimality in 
(9.23)}. 
Property 4 (Pareto Front [7, 11]): For the MOP in (9.23) and the Pareto * * * optimal solution set s , the Pareto front is defned as PF ˇ {(a b, L* Îs * 
with corresponding objective vector ( , * * a b )} . Since the solution of the * MOP is not unique, all solutions ( , a b*
) are in PF . 
Then we get the following result of the suboptimal method in (9.23) for the MOP 
of the SEF design in (9.22). 
Theorem 9.2: The suboptimal MOP in (9.23) is equivalent to the MOP in (9.22) 
for the design of MO H2/H∞ SEF. 
Proof: Please refer to Appendix 9.7.2. 
From Theorem 9.2, the MO H2/H∞ SEF design becomes how to specify flter gain 
L in (9.15) to solve the MOP in (9.23). The following lemmas are useful for solving 
the MOP in (9.23) for the SEF design of the stochastic augmented system in (9.19). 
Lemma 9.1: (Itô-Lévy lemma of linear stochastic system [130, 234]) For the lin￾ear stochastic jump-diffusion system in (19), the Itô-Lévy formula for the Lyapunov 
function V x( (˜ t )) = x˜

where r is a nonzero real number. 
Based on Theorem 9.2 and Lemmas 9.1 and 9.2, we get the following result. 
Theorem 9.3: The MOP in (9.23) for the design of the MO H2/H∞ SEF in (9.15) 
of the linear stochastic jump-diffusion system in (9.9) could be transformed into the

In order to avoid interference from the malicious attack signals f t( ) and f t( ), the a s

In general, the observability criterion of the augmented nonlinear stochastic 
jump-diffusion systems in (9.32) cannot be expressed as a simple explicit condition 
(e.g., rank condition or matrix equality). The following lemma from [257] is pro￾vided to test the observability of the augmented nonlinear stochastic jump-diffusion 
systems in (9.32): 
Lemma 3 ([257]): T T Defne the augmented vector z t() = ë éy t() dy ( )t dt ˙
N ¶2 z t( ) x T d (t)ù
û d ( ( )) = N y t() and the corresponding Jacobian matrix Y x z t 2 . The augmented ¶x t() 
nonlinear stochastic jump-diffusion system in (9.32) is observable at the equilibrium 
point x() t = 0 if there exist a constant e > 0 and a constant matrix T such that the 
absolute values of the leading principal minors D1 ((x( t)),..., DN ( ( x t)) of TYz ( ( x t)) 
satisfy the following ratio conditions: x 
D1 ((x( )t ) ³ e 
 
DN ( ( x t )) ³ " e , x t( ) x 
where Nx = (a + sk )( + + 1) n is the dimension index of x( )t , and the principal minor 
Di( ( x t)) is the determinant of the matrix by deleting the last Nx - i columns and rows 
of Jacobian TYz (( x t)). 
To simplify the flter design, the following Luenberger-type flter is employed to 
estimate for the stochastic nonlinear augmented systems in (9.32): 
dx t = f x t + l x t y t - y t dt ˆ() { (ˆ( ))( ˆ( ))( () ˆ( ))} 
(9.33) 
yt ˆ() = c(x t ˆ( )) 
where l x( (ˆ t )) is the flter gain to be designed and x t and ˆ( ) ˆ() y t are the estimated 
system state and the estimated measurement output, respectively. 
The stochastic H2 fltering performance for the Luenberger-type flter is proposed 
as follows: 
H l 2 ( ( (x t))) ˆ = E tf ( ( x t ) – x t Q x t ˆ( ))T 
2 ( ( ) – x t ˆ( ))dt (9.34) ò0
where Q2 ³ 0 is the weighting matrix of the state estimation error in the H2 fltering 
performance, and °() é T x t = x () . T ( )t , x

Since the augmented disturbance v( )t will infuence the fltering performance, the 
stochastic robust H∞ fltering performance is proposed to attenuate the effect of the 
augmented disturbance v( )t on the estimation error as follows: 206 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

The MO H2/H∞ SEF design problem for the nonlinear stochastic jump-diffusion 
system is formulated as follows: 
mi ˆ ˆ n( H l(( x(t ))), H l(( x( t )))) s.t. (9.32 ) - (9.33) (9.36) ˆ 2 ¥ l( ( x t ))
In (9.36), the H2 and H∞ fltering performance are simultaneously minimized from 
the MO optimization perspective. For convenience of the MO H2/H∞ SEF design in 
(9.36), the augmented system of the nonlinear stochastic system in (9.32) and its 
flter in (9.33) is constructed as follows:

design problem for the nonlinear stochastic jump-diffusion augmented system in 
(9.37) could be reformulated as follows:

Due to the diffculty in directly solving the MOP in (9.40), the suboptimal method is 
proposed to indirectly solve the MOP in (9.40) as follows:

In general, it is very diffcult to solve the HJIs in (9.45)–(9.47) of the MOP in

where C0 denotes the convex hull of the polytope with N vertices. In other words, 
if the total local linearized systems at all x( )t are inside the convex hull C0, then the 
trajectory x( )t of the nonlinear stochastic jump-diffusion system in (9.32) will be the 
convex combination of the trajectories of the following N local linearized stochastic

Based on the global linearization theory [254, 255], the trajectory of the nonlinear 
stochastic jump-diffusion system in (9.32) could be represented by the convex com￾bination of N local linearized stochastic jump-diffusion systems as follows:

Remark 9.6: Even the nonlinear stochastic system in (9.32) is interpolated by a 
set of local linearized systems, the interpolated system in (9.50) it is still a nonlinear 
system and its observability can not be directly examined. However, by using The￾orem 1, the observability of the local linearized system can be directly examined. 
Similarly, the nonlinear Luenberger-type flter in (9.33) could be represented by 
the global linearization form as follows:

s.t. (9.55) - (9.57) 
Remark 9.8: In this design, the state-independent weighting matrices Q2 and 
Q are chosen in the H2 and H∞ fltering performance in (9.34) and (9.35), respec- ¥ 
tively. If the state-dependent weighting matrices Q ( ( x t)) and Q ( ( x t)) are chosen 2 ¥ 
in these two performance indices, the design procedure is similar to the case of 
state-independent weighting matrices Q2 and Q¥ . In fact, by using the global line￾arization method, Q ( ( x t)) and Q ( ( x t)) can be represented by convex interpolation 2 ¥ 
of N local weighting matrices Q i
 and Q2,i
 at N vertices of polytope in (9.48) as ¥, 
Q ( ( x t)) = N 
v i x tQ ( ( )) = N (( )) and Q x t v ( ( x tQ )) , where { , Q Q }N 
2 å i=1 2,i ¥ å i=1 i ¥,i ¥,i 2,i i=1
are local linearized weighting matrices. Then the design can be achieved by replacing 
the terms Q˜

 and Q˜

After solving the LMI-constrained MOP in (9.58) for P*

, j = 1,..., N, 1 2 j 
the flter gains for the MO H2/H∞ SEF design problem in (9.51) are given by * * -1 * L = P W , and then we can obtain the nonlinear MO H ∞ () SEF in (9.51). 2 j 2 j /H
According to the previous analysis, a reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA to 
solve the MOP in (9.58) for the MO H2/H∞ SEF in (9.41) of the nonlinear stochastic 
jump-diffusion system with malicious attack signals in (9.31) is proposed as follows:  
Security-Enhanced Filter Design for Systems under Attack 211 
L U L U Step 1: Select the search range S = [ , a a ] [ ´ b b, ] for the feasible objec￾tive vector ( , a b ) and set the iteration number Ni
, population number Np , 
crossover rate Rc , and mutation rate Rm in the LMI-constrained MOEA. Set 
iteration number i = 1. 
Step 2: Select Np feasible individuals satisfying the LMIs in (9.55)–(9.57) as 
the initial population P1 from S. 
Step 3: Perform the EA operator with crossover rate Rc and mutation rate 
Rm to generate P1 feasible individuals by examining whether their corre￾sponding objective vectors ( , a b ) are feasible vectors satisfying the LMIs 
in (9.55)–(9.57). 
Step 4: Set the iteration index i i = +1 and select Np elite individuals from 2Np 
feasible individuals in Step 3 through the nondominated sorting method 
and crowded comparison operation. Set the selected elite individuals as the 
population Pi+1. 
Step 5: Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until the iteration number i N= i is satisfed; then 
set the fnal population PN = PF as the Pareto front. i 
Step 6: Select a preferable feasible objective individual ( , * * a b ) Î P accord- F 
ing to the designer’s own preference with the corresponding optimal flter * * -1 * gains L = () P W and j = 12 , ,..., N of the MOP in (9.58). Once the pref- j 2 j 
erable solution is selected. Then we can obtain the SEF from (9.51) for the 
nonlinear stochastic jump-diffusion system in (9.32). 
Remark 9.9: (i) The time complexity of the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA 6 2 6 is approximately estimated as O(e NN m) [19, 258], including O( N for solving p e ) 
LMIs and mN p = 2(n + ( + )( + 2
 for MOEA, where e a sk 1)) is the order of the Lyapu￾nov function matrix P, N is the number of local linearized models in (9.49) of the 
nonlinear stochastic system in (9.32), m = 2 is the number of objectives, and Np is 
the population number of the LMI-constrained MOEA. On the other hand, the space 
(memory) complexity of the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA is approximately es-
+ 2 4 timated as O mNp ) p ) ( Np + 2 (( N in the p N Ne [259, 260] with the memory Om Np ) 
MOEA and the memory O NpNe4 ( ) in the LMI problem. (ii) In the conventional 
MOEAs [7, 11], the search flter gains P1 > 0, P2 > 0, Wj
, and j = 1,..., N for the op￾timal objective vector ( , * * a b )for the MOP in (9.58) directly. When N is large, it be￾comes very diffcult to employ the conventional MOEA to solve the MOP in (9.58). 
Remark 9.10: In the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA, the convergence speed 
greatly depends on the population number. Instinctively, if a large population num￾ber is adopted in MOEA, the number of initial populations that are close to the real 
Pareto front will increase. As a result, it will increase the success probability for 
reaching the real Pareto front. However, in such a case, due to the growth of the pop￾ulation number, the time complexity will be increased with a polynomial increase.

In this section, the MO H2/H∞ SEF is employed for a radar system to estimate the

in Figure 9.1. Suppose the radar sensor is interfered with by malicious attack sig￾nals from the missile and the missile also performs staggering side drift via sudden 
side-step maneuvering via the side jets. By using classical kinematic analysis, the 
dynamic equation of the motions of the incoming ballistic missile could be expressed 
as follows [10, 262]:

By using the dynamic motion of the incoming ballistic missile in (9.59), the non￾linear incoming ballistic missile could be written as follows [10, 262]: 
-r ( (z t)) g X w() -r ( (zt )) gw( X) X t ˛ () = [ xt yt z t ˛ 2b 2b ˛( ), (˛ ), ( ), x t ˛( ), yt ˛( ), (9.61) -r ( (z t))gw( ) X 
2b z t() - g T ˛ ] = f ( ( Xt ))
where 
Xt = [ ( xt ), y t( ), (zt ), x t( ), ( y t ˛ ),z t ˛( )]
T () ˛ 
and 
2 2 2 w( ( Xt )) = x t ˛ ˛ () + yt () + z t ˛ ( )
In order to simplify the notations, we use 
X t() = [ ( xt ), x t 2 ( ), ( x t), 3 x t 4 ( ), ( x t), x t 6 ( )]

Then, suppose the incoming ballistic missile suffers from continuous random noise 
g X() dw t( ) due to the stochastic parameter fuctuation and Poisson jump discontinu￾ous noise j X() dp t( ) due to corporate defaults, component failures, or insured events,
respectively. Then v t( ) is the external disturbance, and n t( ) denotes the measurement 
noise of radar sensor. Both of them are assumed to be zero mean white noise with 
unit variance. Hence, the nonlinear incoming ballistic missile under the detection of 
the radar system can be represented by the following nonlinear stochastic jump-dif￾fusion system: 
dX t = [ (f X) + But + d () ( ) b X( ) ( vt )] dt + g X() dw t()

In order to avoid the attack of a ground anti-missile such as the Patriot, the 
incoming ballistic missile will perform sudden side-step maneuvering through 
its two-side jets, which are considered the defense and evasive signal f t( ) of a 
the missile system or equivalent malicious attack signals on the radar detection 
system in (9.62). On the other hand, the sensor of the ground radar station will 
be interfered with by the incoming missile to cause deterioration of the accu￾racy of the detection capability of radar, which will be regarded as malicious 
attack signal f t( ) on the sensor of the radar detection system. The guidance s

Based on the proposed reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA, the LMI-con￾strained MOP in (9.58) can be solved. The design parameters of MOEA are chosen

the Pareto optimal solutions on the Pareto front, the knee point solution is selected as 216 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

the preferable solution in the Pareto optimal solutions set. In this case, the knee point * * 8 solution of the MO H2/H∞ SEF (, a b )( = 1 868 . . ´10 ,0 3522) is chosen. From the

In general, the incoming ballistic missile can transmit a malicious signal to inter￾fere with the radar sensor and perform staggering side drift as equivalent malicious 
attack signals on the radar detection system via two-side maneuvering by the side 
jets. Therefore, the radar system could not estimate the trajectory of missile system 
precisely. In this simulation, the malicious attack signals f t( ) and f t( ) are shown as a s 
the aperiodic square signal and high frequency sine signal in Figure 9.3, respectively. 
To estimate the effect of unknown swaggering side acceleration and a malicious 
interference signal, the smoothed-model–based SEF design of the malicious attack 
signals f t( ) and f t( ) can be effciently estimated in Figure 9.3. From Figure 9.3, a s 
due to the effect of initial condition, there exist some overshoots in estimating the 
malicious signals. After the effect of the initial condition is eliminated from t = 8s, 
the malicious signals on the system and sensor can be estimated by the proposed 
SEF and can be compensated by the Luenberger flter for missile trajectory estima￾tion. For the proposed SEF design, the estimation of malicious attack signals f t( ) a Security-Enhanced Filter Design for Systems under Attack 217 
FIGURE 9.3 Malicious attack signals f t( ) and f t( ) and their estimation. a s 
and f t( ) interact with each other. For example, when the malicious attack signal s 
f t( ) enters the system at t = 15s, there is a small deviation on the estimated signal ˆ
a
s ( ). On the other hand, the estimated attack signal ˆ 
a ft ft ( ) oscillates due to the high￾frequency sine signal f t( ) from Y t( ) in (9.51). From Figure 9.3, the interacted s 
effects on the estimation are effciently reduced at the steady state. For example, 
once the malicious attack signal f t( ) vanishes, the high-frequency sine signal f t( ) a s 
is precisely estimated by the proposed SEF. 
The states of the incoming ballistic missile system and the corresponding esti￾mated states are shown in Figures 9.4–9.9. From the results of Figures 9.4–9.6, the 
incoming ballistic missile generates the malicious acceleration f t( ) and sensor a 
interference f t( ) to dodge radar system detection. By using the estimated accelera- s 
tion ˆ 
a ( ) and malicious attack signals ˆ 
s ft ft ( ), the three velocities of the missile system 
can be precisely estimated in Figures 9.4–9.6. Meanwhile, due to the good estimation 
of the three velocities, the proposed SEF can also precisely estimate the real position 
of the missile system in Figures 9.7–9.9. Moreover, the effect of external distur￾bance and sensor noise on the estimation is reduced with a minimum attenuation 
level b* = 0 3522 by the proposed H ∞ . SEF design. 2/H 
To compare the effectiveness of the proposed SEF design with conventional 
approaches, the traditional mixed H2/H∞ robust flter design in [255] is carried
out. In the traditional mixed H2/H∞ robust flter, the design is only concerned with 218 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

attenuating the effect of the malicious attack, like the external disturbance and meas￾urement noise on the optimal state estimation of missile. As a result, by the tradi￾tional mixed H2/H∞ robust flter, the state of missile will be more diffcult to estimate 
when the malicious attack signals f t( ) and f t( ) occur. From the result of the tra- a s 
ditional mixed H2/H∞ robust flter in Figures 9.4–9.6, the three estimated velocities 
have large deviations from the missile system when the malicious signals begin to 
attack. Moreover, from the results of the position estimation in Figures 9.7–9.9, the 
three position estimations using the mixed H2/H∞ robust flter have large gaps from 
the missile system. Especially when the last malicious attack signals occur at t = 56s, 
there is a 200-meter gap on the estimation of the altitude trajectory by the mixed 
H2/H∞ robust flter, and there is only a 20-meter gap by the proposed SEF. Thus, 
the mixed H2/H∞ robust flter is still very poor at missile trajectory detection from a 
weaponry resolution perspective. 
9.5.2 sef desIgn for sToChasTIC LInear mass-sPrIng sysTem 
In this section, a fault estimation design proposed in [261] is carried out in compar￾ison with our SEF design. Consider a mass-spring system with two masses and two 
springs as follows [261]: 
xt ˛ () = x t( ) 1 3 
xt ˛ () = x t( ) 2 4 
k k + k (9.67) 1 2 2 c xt ˛ () = - x t() + xt () - xt () + u t( ) 3 m 1 m 2 m 3 1 1 1 
k k c x t = 2 x t() - 2 ˛ () x t() - x t( ) 4 m 1 m 2 m 4 2 2 2 
where x t( ) is the position of mass 1; x t( ) is the position of mass 2; x t( ) is the veloc- 1 2 3 
ity of mass 1; x t( ) is the velocity of mass 2; u t() = Kx( )t is the control input with 4 
state-feedback controller gain K ; k1 and k2 are spring constants of springs 1 and 2, 
respectively; m1 and m2 are the masses of masses 1 and 2, respectively; and c is the 
viscous friction coeffcient. 
Under the concept of a networked control system, the mass-spring system in (9.67) 
is controlled by a remote control station. In this situation, a malicious attack signal 
will infuence the control and fltering of the mechanical system through the attack on 
the system and the sensor of the wireless network. Furthermore, due to the intrinsic 
model uncertainties and unpredictable element deformation in physical plant, the 
networked-based mass-spring system in (9.67) should be modifed as follows: 
dx( )t = [( A + BK) ( xt ) + B v(t ) + B f t( )] dt + Gx() t dw t( ) d a a 
+Jx(t d ) ( pt ) (9.68) 
y t() = Cx( )t + B n t() + B f ( )t n s s 222 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
where x t() = [ ( xt ) x t( ) xt ( ) xt ( )] T denotes the state vector, y t( ) is the meas- 1 2 3 4

 is the a 
°2 malicious attack signal on the system, f t() Î is the malicious attack signal on s 
the sensor, n t( ) denotes the fnite-energy measurement noise, w t( ) is the 1-D Wie-
°1 ner process, and p t() Î is the Poisson counting process with jump intensity 0.2. 
For the stochastic mass-spring system in (9.68), Gx() td wt ( ) is used to describe the
effect of unmodeling parameters and intrinsic random continuous fuctuations, while 
Jx() td pt ( ) denotes the effect of a sudden random event such as package dropout and 
element deformation. 
Given the parameters in a mass-spring system as k = k = 1, m = 1, m = 0 5. , and 1 2 1 2 
c = 0 5. , the detailed system matrices in (9.68) can be written as follows:

To construct the third-order smoothed signal models in (9.5) and (9.8), the extrapola￾tion parameters in (9.13) and (9.7) are selected as a = 0 7. , a = 0 2. , a = a = 0 0. 5 , 0 1 2 3 - b = 0 6. , b = 0 2. , and b = b = 0 1. , and the time interval h is chosen as 10 3

In this simulation, the initial values x( ) 0 , external disturbance v t( ), malicious 
attack signal on system f t( ), malicious attack signal on sensor f t( ), and measure- a s

where N( , 0 1) denotes the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. 
Since the designer considers the fltering performance of position more important 
than the fltering performance of velocity, the weighting matrices for the stochastic 
H2 fltering performance in (9.16) and the stochastic robust H∞ fltering performance 
in (9.17) are given as:

Before applying the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA, the detailed parameters in 
MOEA are given as: iteration number Ni = 80, search range S = [ , 0 50] [ ´ 0 , ] 5 , cross￾over rate R = 0 9. , mutation rate R = 0 1. , and population number N = 500. Then, c m p 
by solving the MOP in (9.30) with the aforementioned parameters in the LMI-con￾strained MOEA, we could get a set of Pareto optimal objective vector (. 20 15, . 3 21)

The simulation results are shown in Figures 9.10–9.13 with state variable esti￾mations in Figs. 9.10–9.11 and malicious attack signal estimations in Figures 9.12– 
9.13. Moreover, the flter design of the malicious attack signal in [261] is carried out. 
From Figures 9.10 and 9.13, by the accurate estimation of the malicious attack signal 
on the sensor, the proposed robust SEF can achieve better fltering performance of 
position variables x t( ) and x t( ) in spite of the effect of the measurement noise and 1 2

malicious attack signal on the sensor. On the other hand, since the velocity variables 
x t( ) and x t( ) suffer from the intrinsic fuctuations and unknown malicious attack 3 4 
signal f t( ) on the actuator, the real velocities x t( ) and x t( ) fuctuate during the a 3 4 
fltering process. By using the accurate estimation of malicious attack signal f t( ) in a 
Figure 9.12, the proposed SEF can effciently estimate the velocity variables x t( ) 3 
and x t() with compensation for the malicious attack signal f t( ). Besides, in the 4 a 
case of the design method in [261], it can be seen that the flter in [261] has a large 
transient response in estimating malicious fault signals. Hence, due to these large 
transient responses, the estimation of state variables by the flter design in [261] is 
severely affected by the malicious attack signals f t( ) and f t( ). a s 
9.6 CONCLUSION 
Security-enhanced flter design problems will become an important issue in signal 
processing systems under malicious attack signals in information transmission. For 
linear and nonlinear stochastic jump-diffusion systems suffering from system and 
sensor malicious attack signals and external disturbances, based on the proposed 
smoothed model of malicious attack signals, an SEF is proposed to effciently esti￾mate the system state and malicious attack signals on the signal system and sensor 
by the traditional Luenberger-type flter. The stochastic MO H2/H∞ SEF design is 226 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
 
 
proposed to effciently attenuate the effect of external disturbance to achieve security 
fltering performance. In the nonlinear system case, the stochastic MO H2/H∞ SEF 
design problem can be transformed into the HJI-constrained MOP. Nevertheless, the 
HJI-constrained MOP is not easy to solve yet. The global linearization method is 
employed to transform the HJI-constrained MOP to an LMI-constrained MOP. By 
using the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA, the LMI-constrained MOP for the MO 
H2/H∞ SEF design of a stochastic jump-diffusion system under malicious attack sig￾nals can be solved effciently. Two simulation examples, a missile trajectory estima￾tion problem by a ground radar system under malicious attack signals and estimation 
of a network-based mass spring system, are given to validate the effectiveness of the 
proposed method. In the future 5G wireless networked era, network-based security 
flter design to estimate trajectory/attack signals on receivers and sensors of wireless 
networks will be future research.

In case (IV), by the disjoint conditions eig A() Ç eig A() a = Æ and

9.7.2 Proof of Theorem 9.2 
This will be proven by the fact that the strict inequalities in (9.24) will disappear and 
only equalities hold when the Pareto optimal solution ( , * * a b )of the MOP in (9.23) is
achieved. We will prove the fact by contradiction. Suppose that a strict inequality still 
holds for any one inequality in (9.24) at the Pareto optimal solution. Given a solution 
L* with corresponding objective value ( , * * a b ) , without loss of generality, we assume * * * ¢ * H L() < a* . Then there exists an a such that HL =a¢ < a b 2 ¢ 2 () a . This means (, ) 
dominates the Pareto optimal solution ( , * * a b ) , which is not dominated by other230 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

solutions. Based on the previous discussion, when the Pareto optimal solution of the 
MOP in (9.23) is reached, we can conclude that the inequalities in (9.24) become 
equalities. Thus, the MOP in (9.23) is defnitely equivalent to the MOP in (9.22). 
9.7.3 Proof of Theorem 9.3 
The proof of the theorem is divided into two parts: The frst part is for H L() £ a , 2 
and the second part is for H L() £ b . ¥ 
(I) By utilizing Lemma 9.1, the Lyapunov function V x˜ t = xT ( ( )) ˜ () t Px t ˜( ) with 
a positive matrix P is selected for the augmented system in (9.19) with 
v() t = 0, and we get 
HL = E[ f

˜ ( ) ˜ 
2 ˜ t 
dV xt ˜ P ò ò 0 0 (9.82) 
- ˜

By substituting V x( (˜ t)) in (9.25) into (9.82) with the fact Ed [ wt ( )] = 0 and
E d[ ( pt )] = ldt, the H2 optimization performance becomes: 
t ˜ ò f T T T T

If (9.27) holds, then (9.83) becomes 
2 ˜

Besides, for the term x˜
T ( ) 0 Px˜( ) 0 on the right-hand side of the previous inequality, 
we have the following equality: 
E x[ (0) ( Px˜ 0)] = [ [ ˜ 0 x˜ 0 = tr PE[ R0 ˜ ]] T tr PE xT ()( )]] [ (9.85) 
where R0 = x˜( ) 0 x˜

Therefore, if the inequalities in (9.27) and (9.28) are satisfed, the inequality 
H L() £ a in (9.24) can be guaranteed. 2

10 Multi-Objective H2/H∞ 
Optimal Power Tracking 
Control for Interference￾Limited Wireless 
Communication Systems 
10.1 INTRODUCTION 
For next-generation wireless systems, the ever-increasing demands by users shar￾ing wireless services have made new standards (such as IEEE 802.16m [264] and 
3GPP LTE-A [265]) to allow users to interfere with each other inevitable. Inter-user 
interference has hence become one of the bottlenecks limiting the performance of 
next-generation wireless systems. For example, in a reuse-1 cellular system where 
the same frequency band is used in all the cells and sectors, cell-edge users may 
experience strong interference from neighboring cells, resulting in poor quality of 
service (QoS). In a underlay cognitive radio (CR) network, a CR user is only allowed 
to coexist with the primary user (PU) if the interference level caused by the CR user 
can be managed under a tolerable threshold [266]. 
As a result, interference management has become an important topic of interest 
[267–276]. In particular, the issue of power control in interference-limited wire￾less systems has attracted enormous attention recently [273, 274, 276, 277]. Power 
control over frequency bands for an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing 
(OFDM) system was presented in [278] to consider power optimization over orthog￾onal subcarriers. In [274], a cross-layer power allocation scheme for a code division 
multiple access (CDMA) system was considered. Both open-loop and closed-loop 
power control were then investigated. 
In this chapter, we consider a closed-loop power control tracking problem for inter￾ference-limited wireless networks. In a closed-loop power control system, a reverse 
feedback link is available to the receiver to track a desirable target signal-to-interference￾and-noise ratio (SINR) [275, 276, 279]. According to the measured SINR, the receiver 
can convey the information to the transmitter via the reverse feedback link to revise 
the transmission power in a closed-loop fashion. For instance, a robust power track￾ing control design was proposed to achieve a robust optimal target SINR tracking 
from the point of view of minimizing the worst-case interference upon tracking error 
[280]. In [281], a robust state feedback control via a desired pole placement and an l1 
optimal predictor was used to predict the tracking error to compensate for the effect 
of round-trip delay for power control. A two-step power control flter design was Interference-Limited Wireless Communication Systems 237 
also proposed by utilizing H2 optimal approximation theory to minimize the effect of 
uncertain noise and interference on the target SINR tracking [277]. 
Multiple-objective problems often arise in practical power control systems when 
tradeoffs between multiple objectives need to be considered in spite of most existing 
studies focusing on single-objective problems. Generally speaking, MOPs have two 
or more objectives, and the objectives may confict with each other. As a result, there 
often does not exist a global solution that achieves the optimal values for all objective 
functions universally and hence will be dominant in all aspects. A legitimate solution 
to MOPs is therefore to seek a set of solutions, the so-called Pareto optimal solutions, 
such that each of these solutions is not dominated by any other solutions [211, 282]. 
There are two general approaches to MOPs. One is to use a classical algorithm 
such as the weighted sum method [283, 284]. The concept of the weighted sum 
method is to provide weighting parameters to each objective function and combine 
these objective functions to form a single objective function. But the resulting solu￾tion highly depends on the proper selection of the weighting parameters. Once given 
suitable weighting parameters, proper Pareto optimal solutions for the MOP can be 
found directly. However, accurately and precisely selecting these weights can be 
quite diffcult in practice. On the other hand, a set of MOP Pareto optimal solutions 
can be obtained by multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, which consist of a niche 
Pareto genetic algorithm (NPGA) [285], nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II 
[2], and so on. MOEAs are designed based on two common goals, a fast and relia￾ble convergence to the Pareto optimal set and a good distribution of solutions along 
the Pareto front. These algorithms are inspired by biological evolution, including 
the processes of reproduction, mutation, crossover, and selection. The advantages of 
these algorithms are that auxiliary information (differentiability or continuity) of the 
objective functions is not needed and that almost the entire Pareto optimal set can be 
obtained. 
In this chapter, an evolution algorithm method based on NSGA-II is combined 
with the LMI convex optimization technique to deal with an LMI-constrained 
MOP for multi-objective H2/H∞ power tracking control for interference-limited 
wireless systems. In other words, the optimal H2 tracking performance [277] and 
H∞ robust performance are considered simultaneously as an MOP. For optimal H2 
tracking performance, the mean-square tracking error in the power control of the 
interference-limited wireless system should be minimized. For optimal H∞ robust 
performance, the worst-case effect of channel delay and interference upon the 
SINR tracking error should also be minimized. Since H2 and H∞ tracking objec￾tives have conficting natures, they ft well into the MOP formulation. The resulting 
multi-objective H2/H∞ power tracking control is much more complex than con￾ventional MOPs with algebraic functional constraints [2, 283–285], since for an 
interference-limited wireless network, the power control system is a stochastic 
dynamic system with interference and delay. To handle this complication, we pro￾pose an equivalent formulation by minimizing the upper bounds of two objective 
functions in the considered MOP. Furthermore, based on the stochastic state-space 
model of the power control system, the resulting constraints for the equivalent 
multi-objective H2/H∞ power tracking control problem are transformed into LMI 
constraints to simplify the design procedure; that is, we obtain an equivalent 238 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
 
 
 
 
LMI-constrained MOP. The LMI toolbox in MATLAB can be combined with an 
MOEA search based on NSGA-II to solve the LMI-constrained MOP, and a set of 
Pareto optimal solutions for controller gains is thus obtained. These Pareto optimal 
solutions are not dominated by any other solutions, and one particular solution can 
be selected based on the tradeoff determined by the system designer. With a similar 
procedure, the proposed method can be easily extended to other multi-objective 
designs for wireless communication systems. 
This chapter is divided into six sections as follows: in Section 10.2, the system 
model and a closed-loop power control scheme are introduced for the interference￾limited wireless system, and a state-space model is developed to describe the closed￾loop power tracking control. The multi-objective H2/H∞ power control problem is 
formulated as an LMI-constrained MOP in Section 10.3. In Section 10.4, properties 
of the LMI-constrained MOP and the design procedure of the LMI-based MOEA 
are discussed. Simulation results and discussion are given in Section 10.5. Finally, 
conclusions are presented in Section 10.6. 
Notation: We denote × as the vector Euclidean norm. The inequality A0 
or A0 indicates that matrix A is positive semi-defnite or negative semi-defnite, 
respectively. The trace of matrix A is denoted as Tr( ) A , and E( )× denotes the sta￾tistical mean.

CONTROL OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS 
10.2.1 InTerferenCe-LImITed WIreLess ChanneL modeL 
The architecture of an interference-limited wireless system is illustrated in Fig￾ure 10.1. We consider an N-user, frequency-fat, single-input single-output (SISO) 
interference channel where each transmitter and each receiver is equipped with a 
single antenna. Let s t( ) denote the signal sent from transmitter i to the intended i 
receiver i . The received signal at receiver i can be expressed as 
N 
y t() = h t( ) ( ) s t +åhs () t + n () t (10.1) i ii i ij j i 
j i ¹ 
where hij Î  denotes the channel coeffcient from transmitter j to receiver i , 
and ni represents the additive white Gaussian noise at the receiver end, that is, 
n t()  CN( , 0 s 2
). i n 
The received uplink SINR function at the ith receiver is then given by 
2 2
h t() s t( ) ii i SINR () t = 2 (10.2) i åN 2
h t() s t() +s n 
2 
ji j j i ¹ 
To study the closed-loop power control for the SISO interference channel, we con￾sider the log domain; that is, we use dB as the unit of reference. Hence, (10.2) can 
be rewritten as

In the sequel, we focus on the closed-loop power control problem for the ith trans￾ceiver pair. For notational simplicity, we drop the user index i and defne the fol￾lowing variables

where y t( ) denotes the measured SINR, and x t( ) represents the transmitted power. 
Also, f t( ) indicates the channel fading gain, and w t( ) denotes the multiple access 
interference (MAI) plus the SINR measurement error n t( ). m 
Remark 10.1: Although the channel model under consideration here only con￾cerns a frequency-fat SISO interference channel, we can easily extend our power 
control scheme to a frequency-selective SISO interference channel by implementing 
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing both at the transmitter and receiver ends. 
In an OFDM-based wireless system, the frequency-selective channel is transformed 
into parallel narrow-band sub-channels (or subcarriers). Each sub-channel is now 
frequency fat, and the same formulation and analysis introduced in this chapter can 
be applied accordingly. Note that to study the optimal power control design for fre￾quency-selective channels, OFDM systems have been considered and studied exten￾sively [278, 286–290]. In [290], adaptive subcarrier assignment with power control 
was investigated. Power optimization over orthogonal subcarriers was also studied 
in [278]. 
10.2.2 CLosed-LooP PoWer ConTroL 
The closed-loop power control scheme is depicted in Figure 10.2. Note that a round￾trip delay of d is considered. The transmitted power x t( ) at the transmitter end can 
be described as 
x t() = x t( -1) + u t( - d) (10.5) 
where u t( ) denotes the power control command (PCC). Furthermore, the SINR 
measurement y t( ) at the receiver end can be represented by 
y t() = x t() + f t() - w t() (10.6) 
FIGURE 10.2 Closed-loop power control.

Interference-Limited Wireless Communication Systems 241 
Note that (10.6) is a direct consequence of (10.3) and (10.4). 
In order to maintain the received uplink SINR at a given target SINR b( )t , the 
SINR measurement y t( ) is compared with the target SINR to obtain the measured 
SINR tracking error e t( ) as follows: 
e t() = b( )t - y t() (10.7) 
The SINR tracking error e t() is directly fed into the controller to generate the closed￾loop power control update command u t() , which is then quantized and sent back to 
the transmitter for power control. 
10.2.3 sToChasTIC sTaTe-sPaCe modeL 
From (10.5), (10.6), and (10.7), the measured SINR tracking error e t() can be fur￾ther derived as the following dynamic equation 
e t() = et ( - + - - 1) v t( 1) u t( - d) (10.8) 
where v t( 1) - = b() t - b(t - - 1) ft () + f t( 1) - + wt () - w t( -1) indicates the changes 
of the target SINR and disturbances, including interference, fading, noise, and non￾linear effects. 
For the purpose of designing the state feedback controller, the dynamic equation 
in (10.8) can be transformed into a stochastic state-space model by frst defning a 
state vector 
X t() = [ (et ) u t( - d) ˝ u t( - 2) u t( -1)]T (10.9) 
In (10.9), a sequence of past power command updates and measured SINR tracking 
errors is considered the state vector, and the effect of round-trip delay and channel 
disturbances can be compensated by the state-feedback control. Based on (10.8) and 
(10.9), a stochastic state-space model of the closed-loop power control scheme can 
be expressed as 
X t( += 1) AX() () t + But + Cv() t

The frst state variable equation in (10.10) is a direct consequence of the error 
dynamic equation in (10.8). For the state space model of the power tracking control 
in the interference-limited wireless system presented in (10.10), we assume that there 1´ + (d 1) exists a state feedback controller with controller gain K = [ , k k ,...,k + ]Î ° at 1 2 d 1 
the receiver end. The power control command now becomes: 
u t() = KX() t (10.11) 
Since X t( ) is available at base station, if control gain K is specifed based on the 
multi-objective H2/H∞ tracking performance, we can obtain the corresponding multi￾objective H2/H∞ power command u t() . By substituting (10.11) into (10.10), we
obtain a state-space model of the closed-loop power control system with control gain 
K in the following form: 
X t( + = 1) (A B + K X) () t +Cv t() (10.12) 
e t() = DX() t
(d+1) where X t() Î ° is a state vector; v t( ) is the disturbance in (10.10) with bounded 
power; and A , B , C , and D are constant matrices defned in (10.10) with appro￾priate dimensions. In the next section, based on the state-space model of the closed￾loop power control system proposed here, we seek to properly formulate an MOP 
that considers both the H2 and H∞ tracking performance simultaneously. 
10.3 PROBLEM FORMULATION 
For a state feedback controller design (i.e., how to select the control gain K ) in the 
closed-loop power control scheme in an interference-limited wireless system, we 
now consider both the optimal H2 tracking performance and H∞ robust tracking per￾formance simultaneously. On one hand, the optimal H∞ robust tracking performance 
can be expressed as the following optimization problem [291] 
T f T
E e () e( ) ( (t R) e t( )) t 
1 åt 
=0 e t R1et 
min max T

e t() 2 R1 = min max 2
2 
K v t() v t() 2 R2
(10.13) can be described as how to select the control gain K to minimize the worst￾case power gain from the disturbance v t( ) to the SINR tracking error e t( ) for any 
possible uncertain external disturbance v t() , that is, to minimize the maximum 
effect of v t( ) on the SINR tracking error or to achieve the optimal robust fltering 
of disturbance of v t() . Note that tf is the total transmission data length; R1 and 
R2 are two positive weighting factors. The minimax H∞ scheme in (10.13) is quite Interference-Limited Wireless Communication Systems 243 
suitable for fltering the unknown disturbance v t() . On the other hand, the opti￾mal H2 tracking performance [200] can be described as the following optimization 
problem 
T minimize E e[ (t +1) (e t +1)] (10.14) K 
(10.14) represents the minimization of the mean square SINR tracking error with 
respect to the selection of control gain K , that is, to achieve optimal power tracking 
control. According to (10.13) and (10.14), the multi-objective H2/H∞ power tracking 
control problem for the closed-loop interference limited wireless system in (10.12) 
can be formulated as 
minimize {( f K), fK ( )} (10.15) 1 2 K 
where 
e t() 2 R1 f K() = maximize 2 (10.16) 1 v t() v t() 2 
2 R2
fK = E e[ (t +1 e t + )] (10.17) 2 () T )( 1 
However, because of the stochastic and dynamic nature of the state-space model 
involving the closed-loop power tracking control system in (10.12), the con￾sidered MOP for the multi-objective H2/H power control problem in (10.15), ∞ 
(10.16), and (10.17) is highly complex and diffcult to solve directly by con￾ventional MOEA methods. Therefore, we propose an indirect method to solve 
the MOP in (10.15), (10.16), and (10.17) by the following upper bounds to each 
objective 
e t() 2 R1 f K() = maximize 2
2 £ g (10.18) 1 v t() v t() 2 R2
2 () T fK = E e[ (t +1 )( e t + 1)] £ a (10.19) 
for some positive scalar values g and a , respectively. Based on (10.15), (10.18), 
and (10.19), the multi-objective H2/H∞ power control problem for the closed-loop 
power control system in (10.12) can be formulated in the following manner 
minimize( , g a) K,, a g (10.20) 
subject to f K1 () £ g , fK 2 () £ a244 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
And we have the following lemma: 
Lemma 10.1: The optimization problem in (10.20) is equivalent to the MOP 
described in (10.15)–(10.17). 
Proof: The proof of Lemma 10.1 is straightforward. One only needs to prove both 
inequality constraints in problem (10.20) become equality for Pareto optimal solu￾tions. We will show this by contradiction. * * * Given a 3-tuple Pareto optimal solution ( , K g a,) , we assume that either one of 
the inequalities in (10.20) remains a strict inequality at the optimal solution. With￾out loss of generality, suppose that f K*
) < g * ( . As a result, there exists g such 1 1 * * * * 
1 1 that g < g and that f K( ) = g g a ) 1 . Now, for the same K* , the solution ( , is 
dominated by ( , 1 d* g ) , leading to a contradiction. This implies that both inequality 
constraints in problem (10.20) indeed become equality for Pareto optimal solutions. 
The optimization problem in (10.20) is hence equivalent to the MOP described in 
(10.15)–(10.17). 
Now, the MOP for the multi-objective H2/H∞ power tracking control for the sto￾chastic power control system in (10.12) can be equivalently described as the mini￾mization of both g and a under some inequality constraints. The solution to the 
reformulated MOP in (10.20) will be derived subsequently. Since the specifcation of 
the control gain K for solving the MOP in (10.20) is subject to the stochastic control 
system in (10.12), the MOP in (10.20) cannot be solved by conventional MOEAs, 
and additional efforts are needed. Before further analysis, we introduce the following 
lemma that will be useful for our solution of the MOP in (10.20). 
Lemma 10.2 (Schur Complements) [291]: 
Suppose that P PT =  0 . The following inequality 
T -1 D P D V-  0 (10.21) 
is equivalent to the following LMI: 
æV DT ö ç ÷  0 (10.22) 
è ø D P
Proof: Please refer to [291]. 
Now, we proceed to state the following theorem. 
Theorem 10.1: The multi-objective H2/H∞ power control problem in (10.20) for 
the stochastic dynamic power control system (10.12) can be formulated as the fol￾lowing MOP with three LMI constraints: 
minimize ( , g a) P1 0,P2 0,g a, ,K (10.23a)

a -1 T I - P D D0 (10.23d) (d+ ´ 1) ( 2 d+1) d +1 
where P1  0 and P2  0 are positive-defnite matrices, and if the LMI-constrained 
MOP in (10.23a)–(10.23d) is solved, then the MOP problem in (10.20) is also solved. 
Proof: Please refer to Appendix 10.7.1. 
Based on Theorem 10.1, the multi-objective H2/H∞ power tracking control design 
problem can be transformed into the following equivalent LMI-constrained MOP 
( , * * ga ) = minimize (g a, ) P1 0,P2 0,g a, ,K (10.24) 
subject to LMIs (10.23b) - (10.23d) 
Furthermore, by specifying P1  0 , P2  0 to solve the LMI-constrained MOP in 
(10.24), we can obtain the solutions for the multi-objective H2/H power control ∞ 
design problem. In the next section, we will introduce how to combine the LMI 
toolbox in MATLAB and an MOEA to effciently solve the MOP in (10.24). In gen￾eral, there does not exist a unique global solution for the LMI-constrained MOP in * * * (10.24). However, we can obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions (, PPK, ) of 1 2 
the multi-objective H2/H∞ power control in an interference limited system from the 
viewpoint of MOP. Note that all derivations were based on the worst-case channel 
realization for H∞ and channel covariance for H2. We did not assume perfect channel 
estimation and rather only make use of statistical channel information. 
Remark 10.2: 
• From (10.24), the conventional H∞ power control problem in (10.13) can be 
derived and forms the following SOP [280] 
g 0 = minimizeg P1 0, , g K (10.25) 
subject to LMIs (10.23b) 
• The conventional H2 power control problem in (10.14) can be derived from 
(10.24) to form the following SOP 
a0 = minimize( , g a) P2 0, , a K (10.26) 
subject to LMIs (10.23c) ( - 10.23d)246 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
 
 
* * * * • In general, g ³ g 0 and a ³ a0 , where ( , g a ) denotes the solutions of 
MOP in (10.24). Therefore, g 0 and a0 can be considered lower bounds of g * 
and a*
, respectively. 
• Following a similar procedure, the result of Theorem 10.1 can be easily 
extended to other multi-objective designs of wireless communication systems 
with different LMI constraints. 
10.4 PARETO OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS TO MULTI￾OBJECTIVE POWER CONTROL DESIGN 
In this section, we introduce some fundamental concepts of multi-objective opti￾mization described in (10.24) for multi-objective H2/H power tracking control ∞ 
design. Then an EA-based search method is proposed to effciently solve the LMI￾constrained MOP in (10.24). Finally, a step-by-step design procedure is presented 
for our proposed method. Before further discussion of the solutions for the LMI￾constrained MOP in (10.24), some concepts and defnitions of Pareto optimal solu￾tions are given as follows. 
10.4.1 ConCePTs of PareTo oPTImaL soLuTIons 
In contrast to the single-objective optimization problem, there may not exist a global 
solution that is optimal for all contradicting objectives; it is hence desirable to seek 
a set of good solutions that are no worse than other solutions. This set of solutions is 
called the Pareto optimal solutions from the MOP perspective [282]. These solutions 
are also termed noninferior, admissible, or effcient solutions. 
For illustrative purposes, the proposed MOP is abstractly expressed as 
( , * * ga ) = minimize (g a, )
(P1 2 0,P 0 ,) K ÎW (10.27) 
subject to LMIs (10.23b) - (10.23d) 
where W represents the feasible set. * * * Some concepts regarding the Pareto optimal solution (, PPK, ) with optimal 1 2 
objective values ( , * * g a ) are introduced as follows [282]. 
* * * Defnition 10.1 (Pareto Dominance): For two feasible solutions (, PPK, ) and 1 2 
( , 1 2 P P ,) K in W with two objective values ( , g a ) and ( , g a) subject to LMIs * * 
* * * (10.23b)–(10.23d), respectively. ( , PPK, ) is said to dominate ( , P P , ) K if 1 2 1 2 
g * £ g and a* £ a and at least one of the inequalities is a strict inequality. 
Defnition 10.2 (Pareto Optimality): A feasible solution ( , * * PPK, *
) Î W is said to 1 2 
be Pareto optimal w.r.t. W if and only if there does not exist another feasible solution 
that dominates it. 
Defnition 10.3 (Pareto Optimal Solution Set): For a given MOP in (10.27), the 
Pareto optimal solution set r* is defned as 
* * * * r = {(PPK 1 2 ,, )Î W * * * ( PPK ,, ) is Pareto optimal} 1 2  
 
 
Interference-Limited Wireless Communication Systems 247 
Defnition 10.4 (Pareto Front): For a given MOP in (10.27) and Pareto optimal 
solution set r*
, the Pareto front f * is defned as 
* * * * * * * f = {(g a, ) ( , PPK, ) Î r } 1 2 
10.4.2 desIgn ProCedure 
Note that the concept of Pareto optimal solutions defned in Defnitions 10.1, 
10.2, 10.3, and 10.4 is established on a given feasible set and multiple objective 
function. In this chapter, an MOEA-based search is proposed to solve the Pareto 
optimal solution with the help of the LMI toolbox in MATLAB. First, we begin 
by choosing an initial Pareto population of ( , g a) in the feasible set (i.e., they 
should satisfy the LMIs in (10.23b)–(10.23d)); then the Pareto dominant solutions 
are found via MOEA-based search (i.e., to search for nondominant level of the 
initial population). Next, a new population is generated as the child population by 
crossover and mutation. The search for the nondominant level in the feasible set 
is then carried out. This procedure is conducted iteratively to fnd the fnal pop￾ulation that approaches the Pareto front. Once the set of the approximate Pareto 
front ( , * * g a ) is obtained, we can solve the LMIs in (10.23b)–(10.23d) to obtain 
the Pareto optimal solutions ( , * * , 2 PPK /H *
1 2 ) , providing us the multi-objective H ∞ 
power control gains K* 
. 
Based on the reformulation and analyses in the previous section and the help of the 
LMI toolbox in MATLAB, a design procedure of the MOEA-based search method 
to solve the LMI-constrained MOP in (10.27) for the multi-objective H2/H∞ power 
control problem is proposed in Algorithm 10.1. 
After the MOEA-based search converges in the proposed design procedure, the 
entire population ( , * * of multi-objective H ∞ g a ) power control solutions will be 2/H * * * close to the Pareto front f * with corresponding Pareto optimal solutions ( , PPK, ) 1 2 
from the LMIs in (10.23b)–(10.23d) by the LMI toolbox in MATLAB. 
10.5 SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
For the illustration of the proposed multi-objective H2/H power tracking control ∞ 
method, we consider a typical interference limited wireless system, a direct-sequence 
code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system, as a design example and provide 
numerical experiments to verify the effectiveness of the design procedure. We frst 
introduce the simulation settings and demonstrate that the Pareto front ( , * * g a ) is
indeed closely approximated by the proposed MOEA-based search method through 
the combination of the LMI technique with the NSGA-II algorithm. Then we solve 
the Pareto optimal solutions ( , * * , 2 PPK /H *
) , providing us the multi-objective H 1 2 ∞
power tracking control gains K* 
. 
10.5.1 sImuLaTIon seTTIngs for muLTI-objeCTIve oPTImIzaTIon 
In this subsection, the simulation settings for the multi-objective evolution search 
algorithm in the design procedure are given as follows: we set the crossover 248 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
probability pc = 0 9. , mutation probability pm = 0 1. , distribution index for cross￾over h c = 20 , and mutation operator h m = 20 . In all our simulations, we use the 
proposed design procedure to search for a set of the Pareto front ( , * * g a ) , the
corresponding Pareto optimal solutions ( , * * PPK, *
) , and hence the sate feedback 1 2 
controller gains K*
, which are then used as power control update command in 
(10.11). 
The two weighting factors R1 and R2 in the LMI (10.23b) can be used as free 
design parameters to make a proper tradeoff between the system response time and 
the noise fltering capability. In our design example, the ratio R R is chosen to be 1 / 2 
0.0773, based on the optimal choice of parameters for the H∞ power control in [280]. 
The optimal objectives ( , * * g a ) and the corresponding power tracking control gains 
K* are solved from (10.23a)–(10.23d), respectively. 
From Figure 10.3, we observe that the Pareto optimal solutions obtained by Algo￾rithm 10.1 are indeed distributed along the Pareto front. A particular Pareto optimal 
solution can then be selected based on the desirable tradeoff determined by the sys￾tem designer. From Figure 10.3, we can also observe good solution diversity for 
the Pareto solutions generated by Algorithm 10.1. The effectiveness of the proposed 
MOEA-based search method is hence verifed.

Algorithm 10.1 
Step 1: Solve the SOP in (10.25) for g 0 and the SOP in (10.26) for a0 to fnd the lower bound of 
the H2 and H∞ objectives, respectively. Then the Pareto front ( , * * g a )is lower bounded as 
g * ³ g 0 and a* ³a0 . 
Step 2: Set the size of population, the maximum number of generations, crossover, and mutation 
probability in the proposed MOEA search. 
Step 3: Initialize a population such that all pairs ( , g a) in the population are within g g ³ 0 and
a a³ 0. With the help of the LMI toolbox in MATLAB, determine whether there exist 
P1  0 and P2  0 that satisfy (10.23b)–(10.23d) for each pair ( , g a). If not, the 
corresponding pair is discarded and another pair ( , g a) is added to the initial population so 
that the corresponding LMIs have the solution P1  0 , P2  0. 
Step 4: Assign a nondomination level to each pair ( , g a) within the population. Notice that pairs 
assigned the same nondomination level do not dominate each other. 
Step 5: Sort the initial population based on their nondomination levels. Each solution pair is 
assigned a ftness (rank) that is equal to its nondomination level. Once the nondominated 
sort is completed, a crowding distance is assigned. 
Step 6: Perform binary tournament selection by ftness and keep half of the population using a 
crowded-comparison operator based on the NSGA-II algorithm [2]. 
Step 7: Reproduce the child population by the remaining half of the parent population through the 
crossover operator, called simulated binary crossover (SBX) [292], and the mutation

NSGA-II algorithm. For each solution pair ( , g a) in the child population, ( , PP 1 2 , ) K is 
solved from LMIs (10.23b)–(10.23d) with the help of the LMI toolbox in MATLAB to 
guarantee a feasible child population for the MOP in (10.24). 
Step 8: Combine the better half of the parent population with the generated child population to 
form a new population ( , g a). 
Step 9: If the maximum number of generations is reached, halt the algorithm. If not, repeat steps 
f * 4–8 until the current population of ( , g a) approaches the Pareto front . 
10.5.2 PerformanCe of The mo H2/H∞ PoWer ConTroL In 
a ds-Cdma CommunICaTIon sysTem 
Now, the performance of the multi-objective H2/H∞ power tracking control obtained 
from the proposed algorithm is evaluated by numerical simulation in a DS-CDMA 
communication system. In the sequel, numerical results are conducted using Monte 
Carlo simulations. The channels utilized are the uplink channels for the DS-CDMA 
system and are concisely described in the following. 
The uplink channel is considered a time-varying power gain f t( ) consisting of a 
slow fading f ( )t component (shadow fading) and a fast fading f ( )t component slow fast 
(multipath). The slow fading power gain comprises a distance-dependent propaga￾tion loss and a slow power fuctuation (shadow fading) due to obstruction in the 
propagation link, and it can be expressed as [293]: 
f ( )t = F -10n log(D) + S (t) (10.28) slow 0 s 250 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
where F0 is a constant, n is the path loss exponent, and D denotes the distance between 
the base station and the mobile station. Ss is the shadow fading process that is typical of 
a log-normal Gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation s s . 
The fast fading power gain ffast ( )t is the fast power fuctuation owing to channel 
fading and follows the typical Rayleigh distribution. Jakes’ model is used to model 
the fast fading power gain. Apart from fading, the uplink channel is also corrupted by 
multiple access interference and SINR measurement errors. 
We assumed 12 mobiles in the range of a base station. The operational frequency 
is approximately 2 GHz, and the bandwidth W for each channel is 3.6864 MHz in 
a CDMA 2000–3x system, where the simulated environment depends on the pseu￾do-noise chip rate [294]. The data rate Rd is set at 9.6 kHz, and thus the processing 
gain becomes 21 dB. The required E I / = 7 dB if the bit error rate (BER) is no b b 
more than 10-1, where E b and I0 are the energy per information bit and the total 
interference and noise power spectral density, respectively. The SINR can be repre￾sented by SINR () dB = (ER b d ) / (IW 0 ) , and we denote the target SINR by SINRtarget 
to ensure acceptable link quality, with a typical value of SINR = -10 dB. For sim- target 
plicity, the measurement error n t( ) is ignored. According to the operational environ- m 
ment, the shadowing log-standard deviation s is set to be 4.3 dB in urban areas, and a 
typical value of 8 dB is used for suburban areas [295, 296]. The power control update 
command is calculated by (10.11) during every update interval Tu using the adap￾tive quantization law to quantize and reconstruct the updated command. The adaptive 
quantization and reconstruction step size scalar d ( )t can be updated as follows [297] 
é 2 2 ù d () t = bd (t -1 ) + - (1 b )s˝e (10.29) ëê ûú 
where b and sˆ e is the forgetting factor and the sample standard deviation of power 
control error during the update window size, respectively. In the ensuing simulations, 
we assume b = 0 9. 5 , T = . u 1 25 ms and then defne the standard deviation of SINR 
tracking error as the performance criterion 
sˆ e

M 
(SINRtarget - y t( ))2 (10.30) M t =1 
where y t( ) is given by (10.6), and M is the update window length and equals 12 in 
this simulation. For a given ratio R R 1 / 2 = 0 0773 . , we choose three corresponding 
Pareto optimal solutions as in Figure 10.3 and compare the corresponding power 
control performances. The optimal objectives ( , * * and power control gains K* g a ) 
of the three Pareto optimal solutions are given in Table 10.1, where Pareto solution 1 
is close to the optimal H∞ solution, Pareto solution 3 is close to the optimal H2 solu￾tion, and Pareto solution 2 demonstrates a tradeoff in between. 
Since the overall channel fading power control gain f t( ) depends on the mobile 
velocity, we consider 50~150 km/hr in mobile speeds, corresponding to a channel 
coherence time ranging from 0.36~1.08 ms . The round-trip delay is set to 2, the 
same as the sampling period Ts . * * *

Figure 10.4 shows the standard deviations of the SINR tracking error sˆ e versus 
the mobile velocity v for different Pareto optimal solutions. Interestingly, the opti￾mal H∞ solution (Pareto solution 1) achieves better performance than the optimal 
H2 solution (Pareto solution 3) even when the comparison criterion sˆ e in (10.30) is 
the standard deviation of the H2 tracking error. This may result from the high sensi￾tivity of the optimal H2 control to modeling errors. Furthermore, by proper tradeoff 
between H2 and H∞ power control, we can obtain Pareto solution 3 that achieves even 
better performance than the other two Pareto solutions. 
In Figure 10.5, we compare the performance of the proposed multi-objective H2/H∞ 
power tracking control (Pareto solution 2) with other power control schemes, such 
as the conventional power control with fxed step size (with both 1 and 2 power con￾trol bit (PCB)) [298], adaptive step size method (with both 1 and 2 PCB) [297], and 
Smith predictor scheme [299] in terms of the standard deviation of the power control

schemes based on the tracking performance sˆ e versus v. 
tracking error. Clearly, from Figure 10.5, we observe that the proposed scheme is 
more robust compared to other existing schemes. The robustness of the proposed 
scheme is due to the fact that the MO H2/H∞ power control is capable of compensat￾ing for the round trip delay and mitigating the effect of system uncertainties. 
10.5.3 effeCT on ouTage ProbabILITy 
Outages may occur for the communication link and lead to momentary deterioration 
of the system performance when the measured SINR goes below a minimum SINR. 
Here, the minimum SINR, denoted by SINRmin , is set to a typical value of –14 dB 
to ensure acceptable link quality. Consequently, the power control performance of 
communication system can also be measured by the outage probability denoted by 
P as follows o 
P = Prob{ SINR S < INR (10.31) o min} 
In general, the outage probability Po depends on the uplink channel fading f t() 
and changes as a function of the mobile velocity and period of sampling. In this 
simulation, the operational environment we choose is based on the CDMA 2000–3x Interference-Limited Wireless Communication Systems 253 
system, with the data rate Rd being set to 9.6 kHz and the sampling period Ts being 
set to the reciprocal of Rd . The outage probability Po versus mobile velocity for dif￾ferent Pareto solutions from the proposed MO power tracking algorithm is given in 
Figure 10.6. It can be seen that Pareto solution 2 achieves a lower outage probability 
than other Pareto solutions; that is, a properly selected tradeoff between the optimal 
H2 and the optimal H∞ tracking controls can lead to a smaller outage probability. As 
can be observed from Figures 10.4 and 10.6, Pareto solution 2 actually outperforms 
the other two Pareto solutions both in tracking error and outage probability, demon￾strating again the importance of a carefully selected tradeoff. 
The proposed multi-objective H2/H∞ power tracking control method is also com￾pared with other power control schemes, such as the conventional power control with 
fxed step size (with both 1 and 2 PCB) [298], adaptive step size method (with both 
1 and 2 PCB) [297], and Smith predictor scheme [299] in terms of outage probabil￾ity. From the Monte Carlo simulation results in Figure 10.7, it can be seen that the 
outage probability of the proposed multi-objective H2/H∞ method (Pareto solution 2) 
is indeed better than all other existing methods for mobile velocities higher than 
80 (km/hr). For lower mobile velocities, Pareto solution 2 still outperforms all other 
schemes except the power control with adaptive step size and 2 PCB. This is reason￾able since the proposed multi-objective H2/H∞ method is designed to achieve robust 
FIGURE 10.6 Comparison of outage probability Po versus mobile velocity v among three

power tracking control, which should achieve better performance especially when 
system uncertainties and disturbances are high. 
From Figure 10.6 and 10.7, we see that the outage probability increases as the 
velocity of the mobile unit increases. The outage probability is also affected by the 
margin between SINR and SINRmin; that is, target 
SINR margin = SINR target - SINRmin 
Figure 10.8 depicts the outage probability versus SINRmargin. We see that the higher 
, the lower the outage probability. Achieving higher SINRmargin the SINR , how- margin 
ever, requires higher transmission power when SINRmin is fxed. A proper tradeoff 
between system performance (outage probability) and resource (transmission power) 
is hence essential. From Figure 10.8, we can also observe that our proposed optimal 
multi-objective H2/H∞ power control (Pareto solution 2) achieves the lowest outage 
probability. Interference-Limited Wireless Communication Systems 255 
FIGURE 10.8 Outage probability P versus SINRmargin . o 
Figure 10.9 illustrates the time evolution of our proposed H2/H∞ power tracking 
control. Note that SINR is set to –10 dB and that SINRmin is set to –14 dB, as target 
indicated in the fgure. It is clear that our proposed H2/H∞ power tracking control 
indeed tracks SINR well, and the received SINR is above SINRmin for most target 
of the time, demonstrating again the effectiveness and robustness of proposed 
Algorithm 10.1. 
Remark 10.3: It is important to include complexity comparison of the proposed 
multi-objective H2/H∞ with other existing schemes. In fact, the major complexity of 
the proposed scheme comes from the acquisition of the optimal power control gain 
K* that allows the transmitter to update its transmitted power accordingly. Once 
the optimal power gains are available, our SINR tracking procedure is similar to 
all other existing schemes. We would like to point out that all power control gains 
are obtained offine, that is, prior to the iterative procedure of the SINR tracking. 
Therefore, in terms of complexity, our proposed schemes do not sacrifce much 
compared with existing schemes. The slight increase in computational complexity 
of our proposed algorithm does not affect the time required by the algorithm to 
track the target SINR, which is the most crucial complexity incurred by all SINR 
tracking controls. 256 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

10.6 CONCLUSION 
This chapter introduced the multi-objective H2/H∞ closed-loop power control prob￾lem in an interference-limited wireless system. The rest of this chapter is described in 
the following: First, a stochastic closed-loop power control problem for an interfer￾ence-limited wireless system with disturbances is represented by a stochastic state￾space control model. Second, we formulated the optimal robust tracking control of 
the target SINR as an MOP with two conficting objectives: (i) H2 tracking perfor￾mance and (ii) H∞ tracking performance of the closed-loop power control scheme 
must be optimized simultaneously. Third, by the proposed equivalent formulation 
and the LMI technique, the multi-objective H2/H∞ power tacking control problem 
is transformed into an LMI-constrained MOP. Therefore, the multi-objective H2/H∞ 
power tracking problem can be effciently solved by combining an MOEA search 
method (an NSGA-II-based algorithm) with the LMI toolbox in MATLAB to search 
for a set of the Pareto optimal solutions. 
The simulation result demonstrates that the proposed design method can eff￾ciently obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions that approach the Pareto front of the 
concurrent optimization objectives. From the simulation example, the Pareto front 
for multi-objective H2/H∞ power tracking performance can be obtained in a single 
run, and the design time can be reduced. Based on the set of approximate Pareto  
 
 
 
 
Interference-Limited Wireless Communication Systems 257 
optimal solutions thus obtained, proper tradeoff of the H2/H∞ power tracking perfor￾mance can be determined based on the preference of system designers. 
As a design example, we consider a typical interference-limited wireless system, 
a DS-CDMA cellular system. From the numerical experiments, we demonstrated 
that the proposed optimal H2/H power control indeed outperforms all existing ∞ 
schemes both in terms of SINR tracking error and outage probability. We believe 
that the proposed multi-objective H2/H power tracking control mechanism is ∞ 
suitable for future communication system design where multipurpose design may 
become a necessity. 
10.7 APPENDIX 
10.7.1 Proof of Theorem 10.1 
The proof procedure is divided into three steps: (a) The frst step is to show that 
the H power tracking performance in (10.18) leads to the LMI in (10.23b). ∞ 
(b) The second step is to show that the H2 power tracking performance in (10.19) 
leads to the LMIs in (10.23c) and (10.23d). (c) The third step is to show that the 
multi-objective H2/H power tracking control problem in (10.20) is equivalent to ∞ 
solving the LMI-constrained MOP in (10.23a)–(10.23d). 
(a) For the H∞ power tracking performance, the inequality (10.18) is equivalent to 
the following inequality [300]

that is, if the inequality holds for every v t() , then inequality (10.18) also holds.

In fact, the previous H∞ power tracking performance is under the assumption of ini￾tial condition X( ) 0 = 0 . If the effect of initial condition X( ) 0 ¹ 0 is considered in 
the H∞ tracking performance, the H∞ tracking inequality in (10.33) should be modi￾fed as [280, 281, 291]

then the left-hand side of (10.33) or (10.34) will be less than the right-hand side of 
(10.33) or (10.34), respectively. 
From the left-hand side of (10.33) or (10.34), we derive

then the inequality (10.34) holds for X( ) 0 ¹ 0 and the inequality (10.33) holds for 
X( ) 0 = 0 , "v t() ; that is, the upper bound g of the H∞ power tracking performance 
in (10.18) holds if the inequality in (10.36) holds. Applying (10.12) to (10.36) and 
rearranging it, we can obtain the formula in (10.37).

Hence, by using Lemma 10.2 again, we can obtain the following equivalent bilinear

which is the LMI in (10.23b). Hence, if there exists a positive defnite matrix P1  0 
and a matrix K such that (10.23b) is satisfed, then H ∞ tracking performance in
(10.18) or (10.20) has an upper bound g , that is, fK g 1 () £ . 
(b) For the H2 tracking performance, the mean-square SINR tracking error is 
defned as 
J E = {( e t +1 e t +1)} T )(

= Tr( { ( DE Xt +1)X t( +1)D }) T T 
From (10.12), the covariance matrix of X t( +1) is given by 
E X{( t +1)XT (t +1)} 
= E{[(A + BK X t() + ( )][(A + BK Xt T ) Cv t ) ( ) +Cv(t)] }

T T T = ( A B + K E) { ( X t) ( X t)}( AB + K) +CC
Equation (10.41) is obtained by assuming X t( ) and v t( ) to be mutually orthogo￾nal and E v t vT t I = { ( ) T { ( ) ( )} = . Denoting R E X t Xt ( )} and substituting (10.41) into
(10.40), we obtain 
T T T J T = rD ( [( A B + K R) ( A B + K C ) + CD ] )
T T T = Tr( [ D A( + BK) ( R A + BK) - + R CC D] ) (10.42) 
( DT + Tr DR )
We then conclude that the mean-square SINR tracking error J is upper-bounded by

Let P2 = R -1 , and multiply P2 from the left and right side of (10.44); then we get

Applying Lemma 10.2 to (10.45), we obtain its equivalent BMI constraint as follows

which is equivalent to the LMI in (10.23c). This means that if the LMI constraint in 
(10.23c) holds, the H2 tracking performance J has an upper bound a . From (10.43), 
and by the fact Tr( a I ) = a , we obtain d+1 (d+´ 1) (d+1) 
-1 T -1 T æ a ö Tr( DP D ) = Tr P( ) DD £ Tr I = a (10.47) 2 2 ç (d +´ 1) (d+1 ) ÷ è d +1 ø

Hence, if there exists a positive-defnite matrix P2 = P2

Beamforming System 
11.1 INTRODUCTION 
Multiple-input multiple-output transmission has been considered a promising tech￾nique for future wireless cellular networks [301]. MIMO technologies exploit multi￾ple antennas to provide spatial degrees of freedom (DoF), diversity, and multiplexing 
gains [302]. As a result, the MIMO technique can improve the transmission capac￾ity and cell coverage and reduce the bit error rate without requiring extra time or 
frequency resources [303, 304]. Recently, massive MIMO transmission architecture 
with a large number of transmittal antennas has been widely studied for advanced 
ffth-generation technology [305]. The base stations (BSs) send out data streams to 
their multiple users in their own cells simultaneously. However, this concurrent com￾munication will cause not only intracell interference but also intercell interference, 
leading to severe performance degradation. 
For MIMO transmission, multicell multiuser MIMO beamforming design has been 
attracting a lot of attention in the research community recently. However, concurrent 
data transmission of multiple cells generates intercell and intracell interference. In 
multicell multiuser MIMO wireless systems, there are several previous studies inves￾tigating the quality of service or transmission rate maximization of the beamforming 
design problem [306–308]. An iteratively weighted sum transmission rate maximi￾zation algorithm through the minimum mean square error (MMSE) minimization 
scheme is proposed to maximize the total sum transmission rates [306]. A sum trans￾mission rates maximization algorithm based on an iterative linear approximation and 
dirty paper coding is proposed in [307]. An algorithm of sum rate maximization 
with an outage probability constraint on users is proposed in [308]. There are also 
some cases considering different scenarios: MIMO broadcast channels and MIMO 
interference channels [309–312]. However, most of the previous algorithms focus on 
the sum rate maximization but ignore the QoS of each user, which ignores the user 
fairness of the wireless network. Also, the computational complexity is high in most 262 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
of these algorithms with lots of iterations. On the other hand, channel equalization 
could improve signal detection without extra bandwidth and power for training in 
multicell multiuser MIMO wireless systems. Several equalization designs have been 
proposed for signal detection, such as per-subchannel joint equalization for flter 
bank multicarrier systems [313], space time semi-blind equalizer design [314], and 
blind receivers with error propagation for robust detection [315]. For the next gen￾eration of wireless communication networks, an optimal equalization design could 
eliminate channel distortion and ambiguity to achieve optimal signal detection at 
receivers with less resource consumption. 
From the 5G and green communication perspective, lower transmission power and 
green communication design are important upcoming trends. As the physical antenna 
components are inexpensive, the increase in number of radio frequency (RF) chains 
(i.e., mixers, D/A converters, etc.) will eventually increase power consumption and 
the associated complexity of multiple-antenna transmission. Therefore, current cel￾lular networks result in inexpensive and power-hungry terminals. Recently, a large 
amount of work has been devoted to energy effciency and green communication 
design. For the green energy issue in multicell multiuser MIMO transmission, an 
energy-effcient maximization beamforming design with the transmission rate con￾straints of each user is introduced in [316]. In [317], the beamforming design focuses 
on downlink energy effciency maximization. Considering general MIMO interfer￾ence broadcast channels, for example [318–320], a coordinated multicast beamform￾ing power minimization algorithm is proposed in [318]. In [319], the authors propose 
a power minimization algorithm with gam theory. There are also some power mini￾mization designs for other communication systems, such as MIMO-orthogonal fre￾quency division multiple access wireless systems, nonorthogonal multiple access 
(NOMA) transmission, and full-duplex radio access networks [321–324]. Thus, we 
can see that power effciency is an important issue in multicell multiuser MIMO 
wireless communication systems. 
Generally, a multi-objective optimization problem involves several conficting 
objectives. Since multi-objective optimization simultaneously achieves the require￾ments of multiple objectives, it has been applied to many research felds such as 
smart grids [325], communication [326–329], estimation [24], and power tracking 
control [28, 29]. We realize that the simultaneous power consumption minimization 
problem of multicell multiuser MIMO beamforming systems in different groups of 
cells is obviously a confict multi-objective optimization problem and has no unique 
optimal solution. A multi-objective design could provide a set of Pareto optimal solu￾tions to choose from, which can help the designer deal with an extra requirement, 
for example, the one with the best minimum mean square error equalization could be 
chosen as a preferable Pareto optimal solution from a set of Pareto optimal solutions 
of multi-objective beamforming design in the downlink powers of different groups 
of cells. 
In this chapter, we consider a novel multi-objective power minimization design 
via downlink beamforming and equalization to achieve the minimum power con￾sumption of different groups of cells, desired SINR constraints, and optimal MMSE 
equalization simultaneously. We provide the signifcance and diffculty of this power 
minimization MOP as follows: (1) power consumption minimization in different  
 
Design for Energy Effciency in MIMO Beamforming System 263 
groups of cells of a multicell multiuser MIMO beamforming system is a novel and 
important design concept for energy-effcient communication in the future. With the 
advance of communication, different requirements are needed for different com￾munication systems. For example, heterogeneous networks consist of macro and 
micro cells with wireless communication applications such as the Internet of Things 
and relay-based communication. Different applications of communication require 
various amounts of power consumption. With multi-objective design, the designer 
could choose a policy to save on power consumption of multicell multiuser MIMO 
beamforming systems in different groups of cells simultaneously. Thus, it helps with 
power scheduling of this energy-limited area in the era of energy-effcient commu￾nications. (2) When the number of different applications increases in the next gen￾eration of wireless systems, numerous different power consumption requirements 
will lead to a complicated optimization problem with a large number of conficting 
objectives in different time periods. It is diffcult to evaluate the weightings for each 
objective and select a specifc Pareto optimal solution in this MOP. The aforemen￾tioned reasons motivate the multi-objective power minimization design in multicell 
multiuser MIMO systems. To the best of our knowledge, the intricate trade-off power 
minimization problem between different groups of cells has not been studied yet in 
the next generation of wireless communication systems. 
To solve the aforementioned diffcult multi-objective power minimization prob￾lem, a multi-objective power consumption design is proposed to frst specify a set 
of optimal beamformings in the MOP to simultaneously minimize the power con￾sumption of different groups of cells in the multicell multiuser MIMO network under 
the desired constraints of the SINR. In order to solve the multi-objective power 
consumption design problem globally, the original problem is transformed into 
an equivalent semidefnite programming (SDP)–constrained MOP. Then a convex 
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is also proposed to solve the SDP-constrained 
MOP for the multi-objective power minimization problem of the multicell multiuser 
MIMO beamforming system. In general, the multi-objective power minimization 
design problem has no unique optimal solution. A set of Pareto optimal solutions of 
beamformings could be obtained for the multi-objective power minimization prob￾lem by the proposed SDP-constrained MOEA. From the set of Pareto optimal beam￾forming solutions, a solution with the least MMSE equalization is preferred; that is, 
the preferred beamforming equalizer could achieve the minimum power, the lowest 
MMSE equalization, and the SINR constraint simultaneously in the multicell multi￾user MIMO beamforming system. 
The main purposes of this chapter are summarized as follows: 
(1) A novel multi-objective minimum power consumption beamforming design 
problem of different groups of cells with QoS constraints in a multicell mul￾tiuser MIMO network is introduced with imperfect channel state information 
(CSI). 
(2) The original multi-objective power minimization problem is transformed 
into an equivalent convex SDP-constrained MOP, which can be effciently 
solved by the proposed SDP-constrained MOEA with the help of the con￾vex optimization toolbox in MATLAB.

(3) A lowest MMSE equalization is also achieved by a preferred Pareto opti￾mal solution to improve the equalization performance for each user of the 
multicell multiuser MIMO beamforming system. 
This chapter is divided into seven sections as follows: in Section 11.2, the sys￾tem model of the multicell multiuser MIMO network is introduced. The problem 
formulation is also described in the same section. In Section 11.3, a multi-objective 
beamforming optimization for simultaneous minimum powers of different groups of 
cells of the multicell multiuser MIMO network is introduced and reformulated into 
a tractable SDP-constrained MOP in the same section. In Section 11.4, the SDP￾constrained MOEA is introduced for solving the SDP-constrained MOP, and a 
design procedure is also proposed. The MMSE equalizer design procedure is also 
proposed. The MMSE equalizer design of the system is proposed in Section 11.5 as a 
strategy to select a preferred beamforming solution from the Pareto optimal solutions 
to achieve the lowest MMSE-equalization error (i.e., to achieve an optimal MMSE 
equalizer simultaneously). Simulation results are given in Section 11.6 to confrm the 
performance of the beamforming design for the multi-objective power minimization 
problem of the multicell multiuser MIMO communications system. Finally, some 
conclusions are summarized in Section 11.7. 
11.2 SYSTEM MODEL 
In this chapter, we consider a multicell multiuser MIMO interference broadcast net￾work, as shown in Figure 11.1, that is, the so-called multicell multiuser MIMO com￾munication system. The network is composed of Q separate cells, which operate on 
the same frequency band. At each cell, a multiple-antenna base station concurrently 
sends multiple independent data streams to multiple receiver antennas. We assume 
that the number of antennas in each BS and MS is Nt and Nr, respectively. The num￾ber of MS in each cell is K . Let D = min(Nr Nt , ) be the number of data substreams D´1 for each MS. At a specifc cell q, the transmitted data to the ith MS is sq Î˜ . i 
Consequently, the received signal of user i in cell q is shown as

Without loss of generality, we assume that E s sH [ ] = I qq , which is a basic assumption i i 
in multicell multiuser MIMO systems. In contrast to the studies focusing on the sum 
rate maximization problem, we pay attention to the quality of service of each user. 
Assume X = { , 12 , , 3 ...,Q} denotes the set of all cells in the network. We separate the 
multicell network into N groups of cells g1, g2, . . ., gN according to the required 
lower bound of QoS. In each group, different requirements are set, and we design the 
beamforming matrices to satisfy different requirements.

cells q and 2, and group 3 contains cell 1. 
In the real scenario, imperfect CSI should be taken into account, which is mainly due to 
the channel estimation error, the round trip delay, the measurement error, and so on. In this 
scenario, the channel uncertainty model is described in the following unbiased estimations:

For some power shortage region, it is important to design a power-effcient beam￾form to achieve green communication. In the next section, we will introduce the 
problem to design the beamform by power minimization with a QoS constraint. 
11.3 MULTI-OBJECTIVE POWER MINIMIZATION DESIGN FOR THE 
MULTICELL MULTIUSER MIMO BEAMFORMING SYSTEM 
In this chapter, we consider a multi-objective power minimization design problem 
with different groups of cells to achieve green design for energy effciency. In prac￾tice, a wireless communication system is composed of smaller distributed systems. 
This phenomenon is more general in advanced wireless communication (i.e., heter￾ogeneous networks, macro-pico cellular networks, energy harvesting systems, etc.). 
Thus, it is reasonable to divide wireless communication systems into multiple groups 
with different requirements. In the proposed multi-objective design, the beamform￾ing power consumption of different groups of cells is minimized simultaneously with 
the corresponding SINR constraints to achieve the following multi-objective power 
minimization design problem:

To simplify the design procedure, we denote Q = V V H as the transmit covariance q q q i i i 
matrix intended for user i in cell q. In this study, all channels are assumed to be 
quasi-stationary fat fading. The channel uncertainty is assumed to be norm-bounded 
channel uncertainty. Also, since the channel estimation is unbiased, DHqqi
 is assumed H = d 2 to be a zero mean with covariance matrix E H [ D DH ] I . The radius of the qq qq qq i i i

Remark 11.1: For the original multi-objective power minimization problem of the mul￾ticell multiuser MIMO beamforming system in (11.7a)–(11.7b) and the MOP (11.11a)– 
(11.11c) after semi-defnite relaxation (SDR), the quadratic term of the beamforming 
matrix N D t ´ N N t t Vq Î ˜ is relaxed to the covariance matrix Qq Î ˜ ´ according to the i i

have an equivalent convex reformulation in general. If the obtained solution of Qqi

a rank higher than D, then it is diffcult to recover Vqi

The simple recovery method is the use of singular value decomposition (SVD) to Qqi

which has a conservative solution with D higher singular values. At present, existing 
approximation methods can be used to recover the matrix with lower rank, such as the 
related research for the rank-constrained SDP [331–333]. q

In this chapter, the multi-objective power minimization design problem in (11.12)– 
(11.13) for the multicell multiuser MIMO beamforming system is to design the beam￾formings for different groups of cells to minimize their power consumption under the 
requirement of minimum SINR simultaneously. However, it is diffcult to directly 
solve the multi-objective beamforming design problem in (11.12)–(11.13). Therefore, 
an indirect suboptimal method is proposed to solve the MOP in (11.12)–(11.13).

In general, the optimal solution of the MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b) is not unique. 
G is the feasible solution set of the MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b). We will show that 
the indirect MOP (11.14a)–(11.14b) is equivalent to the MOP (11.12)–(11.13) in the 
Pareto optimal sense. 
Theorem 11.1: The indirect MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b) is equivalent to the MOP 
in (11.12)–(11.13) when the Pareto optimal solution is achieved. 
Proof: Please refer to the Appendix 11.8.1. 
Next, we will show that the proposed MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b) is a multi￾objective convex optimization problem, which is also a semidefnite programming– 
constrained MOP. According to Jensen’s inequality and the defnition of the convex 
function in [34, 205, 334], we can derive the following results. 
Remark 11.2: To show that the MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b) is a convex MOP, the 
feasible set should become a convex set. Also, the objective and constraint functions 
must be convex functions [335]. First, the convex property of the feasible set of the 
MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b) is linear functions by Jensen’s inequality, which is well 
known as semidefnite programming constraints [335]. Furthermore, we know that 
the upper bound reformulation can reserve the convex property. Consequently, the 
MOP (11.14a)–(11.14b) is a convex MOP. 
Remark 11.3: If the MOP to minimize power consumption under the power 
budget constraints of each cell is also considered for n = 1,..., N , the original MOP 
for the multicell multiuser MIMO beamforming system can be revised as the follow￾ing MOP:

Remark 11.4: If the single-objective optimization problem to minimize the power

Remark 11.5: If only the power of one group of cells is to be minimized and the 
powers of other groups of cell are under their power budget constraints, the multi￾objective optimization problem can be reduced to a single-objective optimization 
problem by fxing the other objectives with prescribed power budget constraints; 
that is, if we want to minimize the downlink power of group gn, then the power 
minimization beamforming design problem for each group of cells becomes the SOP 
in (11.17) with n = 1,..., N . Normally, we have a* ³ a , a* ³ a , . . .,a* ³ a of the 1 1 2 2 N N

11.4 SDP-CONSTRAINED MOEA FOR MULTI-OBJECTIVE 
POWER MINIMIZATION BEAMFORMING DESIGN 
The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is a stochastic optimization algorithm. 
There are two advantages of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm [205]. In con￾trast to conventional stochastic process, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm ena￾bles fnding a set of the Pareto optimal solutions in a single run instead of performing 
a series of conventionally separate runs by mimicking nature’s evolutionary principles 
to drive its search towards optimal solutions. It reduces the considerable computational 
complexity. Besides, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm can parallel search the 
Pareto optimal solutions globally and escape from the local optima. Second, the MOEA 
requires very little knowledge about the problem and is less susceptible to the shape or 
continuity of the Pareto front. As a result, the MOEA is easy to implement and apply to 
lots of multi-objective optimization problems. Thus, it is very suitable to solve the mul￾ti-objective beamforming design problem in (11.14a)–(11.14b). Moreover, according 
to Defnition 11.5, the multi-objective optimization problem of the multicell multiuser 
MIMO system can guarantee global convergence by its convex constraints. In general, 
the conventional MOEA encodes the variables Qqi
 to obtain the Pareto optimal solu￾tions of the MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b). However, it is not easy to obtain Pareto optimal 
solutions by the conventional MOEA when the number of variables becomes larger. In 
this section, we will provide an SDP-constrained MOEA to search ( , 1 
* ...,a N 
* a ) instead 
to help us obtain the Pareto optimal solutions effciently. Before further discussion, we 
have to introduce the following defnitions for solving the MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b). 
1 1 Defnition 11.1 (Pareto Dominance [205, 334]): Let [Q11,...,QQK ]Î G and 
[Q2 ,..., 2 ]Î G be the feasible solution of the MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b) cor- 11 QQK 
1 1 1 2 2 2 responding to the objective values ( , a ...,a ,...,a ) and ( , a ...,a ,...,a ) 1 n N 1 n N 
1 1 2 2 , respectively. The solution [Q ,..., ] is said to dominate [Q ,..., ] 11 QQK 11 QQK 
1 2 1 2 1 2 if a £ a , . . .,a £ a , . . .,a £ a and at least one inequality is a strict 1 1 n n N N 
inequality. * * Defnition 11.2 (Pareto Optimality [205, 334]): A solution [Q11,...,QQK ]ÎG * * * with the set of objective value ( , a a ...,a ,..., ) is said to be a Pareto opti- 1 n N 
mal solution if and only if there does not exist another feasible solution that 
dominates it. 
Defnition 11.3 (Pareto Optimal Solution Set [205, 334]): For the given 
MOP (11.14a)–(11.14b) of power minimization in the multicell multiuser 
MIMO system, the Pareto optimal solution set r*
 is defned as follows: 
* * * r = {é
ë
Q11,...,QQK ù
û Î G éQ* ,...,Q* ù is Pareto optimal ë 11 QK û } 272 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
Defnition 11.4 (Pareto Front [205, 334]): For the given MOP in (11.14a)– 
(11.14b) of power minimization in the multicell multiuser MIMO beam￾forming system, the Pareto front f *
 is defned as 
* * * * * * * f = {(a ,...,a ,...,a ) [Q ,...,Q ]Î r } 1 n N 11 QK 
Defnition 11.5 (Multi-Objective Convex Optimization Problem [205, 
334]): An MOP with the following form is convex if all the objective func￾tions f x( ), i = 1,..., M are convex and the feasible region is convex (or all i 
inequality functions g x( ), j = 1,..., J are convex and equality functions j 
h x( ), k = 1,..., K are linear). k 
min( f x( ),..., f x( ),..., f x( )) 1 m M x 
subject to the following constraints: 
g x() £ 0, j = 1,..., J j 
h x k () = 0,k = 1,..., K
It is clear that the proposed SDP-constrained MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b) satisfes 
all of the properties in Defnitions 11.1–11.5. The frst step of the proposed 
MOEA is to specify the search region, which is a cuboid region including 
the ideal point as the lower bound and the power budget P max as the upper 
bound. The defnition of the ideal point is as follows. 
Defnition 11.6: The ideal point for the SDP-constrained MOP in (11.14a)– 
(11.14b) is defned as ( , a1 ...,a N ), where a1 is the single-objective problem 
solution in Remark 11.5; that is, a1 is obtained by the single-objective prob￾lem in (11.17) with n = 1, and so on. 
The proposed MOEA frst initializes a number of objective vectors ( , 1 ...,a N a ) from 
the search region. If a feasible objective vector is obtained, it will be encoded into a 
corresponding feasible population Ci
. Note that the search region of the traditional 
MOEA is a variable set (i.e., the proposed method is different from the traditional 
MOEA). In order to guarantee diversity and robustness to obtain the Pareto optimal 
solutions of the MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b), the nondominated sorting method and 
crowding distance sorting are used before the evolution algorithm. As shown in Fig￾ure 11.2, after the EA generates child individuals by natural selection, crossover, and 
mutation, each child individual should be checked for whether it satisfes the SDP 
constraints of the MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b). The feasible individuals will survive as 
candidate individuals. Otherwise, they will be deleted from the candidate sets. The 
current parent front will approach the actual Pareto front in the feasible region by 
the nondominated sorting method, crowding distance sorting, and the evolutionary 
algorithm, as shown in Figure 11.3. We can use MATLAB interior point solver CVX 
[336] to check the feasibility of the SDP constraints. As shown in Figure 11.2, the 
design procedure of the proposed SDP-constrained MOEA for solving the MOP in 
(11.14a)–(11.14b) of the multicell multiuser MIMO system is given as follows. Design for Energy Effciency in MIMO Beamforming System 273

A. The Design Procedure of the Proposed SDP-Constrained MOEA for the 
MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b) 
(1) Solve the single objective optimization problem in (11.17) with n = 1,..., n,..., N 
to specify the search region ( , a ...,a ,...,a ) ( ´ a ,...,a ,...,a ), where a is 1 n N 1 n N n 
the power budget Pmax for all n. 
(2) Set the generation number Ni
, the population size Np , the crossover prob￾ability Pc , and the mutation probability Pm . 
(3) Initialize the population by randomly generating Np feasible individuals 
as the frst parent population in the search region; that is, satisfy the con￾straints in (11.14a)–(11.14b). Set the iteration index i = 1. 
(4) Generate the child population by the parent population through the evolu￾tionary algorithm. 
(5) Combine the parent population with the generated child population to 
form a new population of ( , a a ...,a ,..., ) as the next iteration input. 1 n N 
(6) Assign a nondomination level to each individual ( , a a ...,a ,..., ) within 1 n N 
the population. Notice that individuals assigned the same nondomination 
level do not dominate each other. 
(7) Sort the initial population based on their nondomination levels. Each solu￾tion pair is assigned a ftness (rank) corresponding to its nondomination 
level. All the individuals in the same rank are assigned crowding distance 
(CD), respectively. 
(8) Select half of the elite individuals according to nondomination level and 
CD by the NSGA-II algorithm [2], as shown in Figure 11.2. Set the itera￾tion index ii =+ 1.
(9) Repeat Steps 4 to 8 until the iteration index i reaching the generation num￾ber Ni
 is satisfed. We can get the Pareto front f * = FN , where FN denotes i i 
the Pareto front obtained in the Ni

Remark 11.6: The computational complexity of the proposed SDP-constrained 
MOEA refers to [2, 337]. To acquire the complexity, we know that the number of 
objectives is N (different groups of cells) and the population size is Np . For the MOP 
in (11.14a)–(11.14b), the complexity depends on the row size of inequalities and the 
number of decision variables. There are N Q+ K N+ t

the preferable optimal beamforming by evaluating the minimum mean square error 
equalization errors of the Pareto optimal solutions in the Pareto front and selecting a 
corresponding beamforming with the best MMSE equalization. After obtaining a set 
of optimal beamforming matrixes by MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b), we evaluate their 
MMSE equalization errors for all Pareto optimal solutions of the MOP and select an 
optimal beamforming with the best MMSE equalization. According to the received 
signal of user i in cell q, the estimated signal yˆ q after equalization can be expressed as:

11.6 SIMULATION EXAMPLE 
This section presents the simulation results of the proposed multi-objective power min￾imization problem in a multicell multiuser MIMO beamforming system for energy￾effcient design. We consider a multiuser MIMO interference broadcast channel net￾work as indicated in (11.1) and simulate with the channel coeffcients generated from 
the complex Gaussian distribution ˜˛( , 01 ), which means all the channels are set as 
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading. The transmitted data 
symbols are assumed to be modulated using quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) 
with unit-variance power. The system parameters are summarized in Table 11.1. 
We show the simulation scenario as a simple diagram in Figure 11.4. The chan- 2 2 - nel uncertainties are set the same as the distribution d rq = d e = 10 8
, "r q,, i except i 
for the case in Figure 11.9, in which the performance varies with different uncer￾tainty levels. The additive Gaussian noise vector is generated by the distribution 
˜˛( , 0 d 2 I), where d 2
 changes with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SINR 
lower bound is h = P = 15dB for each group of cells. By the proposed SDP- n,min max 
constrained MOEA, we can effciently solve the MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b) to obtain 
the Pareto optimal solutions in the Pareto front, as shown in Figure 11.5(a), in a sin￾gle run. To compare the proposed Pareto solution with the least MMSE equalization 
and min-max fairness scheme, we consider the following Pareto optimal solutions 
within different regions of interest in the Pareto front. Pareto solution 1 is the knee 
point (minimum total transmittal power consumption) of the Pareto front, where the 
corresponding return of investments (RoI) is denoted as Region 1 in Figure 11.6. 
Pareto solution 2 tends to the minimum transmittal power consumption in the frst 
group of cells, where the corresponding RoI is denoted as Region 2 in Figure 11.6. 
Pareto solution 3 tends to the minimum transmittal power consumption in the second

Pareto solution 4 tends to the minimum transmittal power consumption in the third 
group of cells, where the corresponding RoI is denoted as Region 4 in Figure 11.6. 
Pareto solution 5 is the proposed preferable Pareto solution, which tends to the low￾est MMSE equalization of the multicell multiuser MIMO beamforming system. The 
RoI of Pareto solution 5 is shown as Region 5 in Figure 11.6. Finally, the proposed 
fair Pareto optimal solution tends to the minimum power consumption gap (i.e., 
* * 2 * * 2 * * 2 min (a -a ) + (a -a ) + (a -a ) ) across the three groups of cells, where 1 2 2 3 3 1 
the corresponding RoI is the same as the max-min fairness scheme. According to the 
general weighted-sum method [338], we compared the proposed SDP-constrained 
MOEA with the weighted sum optimization as follows: 
min W a + W a +˝+ W a (11.24a) 11 22 N N Qqi , ( " q, )i 
subject to the SDP constraints in (11.12b) - (11.12c) (11.24b) 
where the positive weightings Wn, " = n 1,..., N are randomly selected from the inter￾val [ , 0 1] and satisfed with the weighting condition åN
W = 1. To generate the n=1 n 
Pareto front, the solution number for the weighted-sum method is 1000, which is the 
same as the population number of the proposed SDP-constrained MOEA. 
In Figures 11.5(a) and 11.5(b), we show the Pareto front obtained by the proposed 
SDP-constrained MOEA and the weighted sum method, respectively. It is obvious 
that the Pareto front obtained by the weighted sum method is more fragmented and 
unevenly distributed than the proposed method. The proposed SDP-constrained 
MOEA can generate the complete Pareto front with good dispersion and smooth 
curves, which is more suitable to fnd the possible preferable Pareto optimal solution 
for the designer. Also, the proposed SDP-constrained MOEA could solve the Pareto 
front in a single run. The weighted sum method of multi-objectives for the Pareto font 
needs to consider the optimization problems of all possible weightings of the objec￾tives. It will become very complicated when the number of objectives becomes larger. 
Although the min-max fairness scheme has its limitations for our multi-objective 
optimization design, we still can provide a comparison between the optimal solution 
of the min-max fairness scheme and the Pareto optimal solutions of the proposed 
MOEA. According to the min-max fairness scheme, we compared the proposed 
Pareto optimal solution with the min-max optimization as follows: 
min max å Tr(Qq ) (11.25a)

subject to the SDP constraints in (11.13) (11.25b) 
where the corresponding RoI of (11.25a)–(11.25b) in the Pareto front is “Region F”, 
as shown in Figure 11.6. In the following, we will compare the power consumption 
performance with the different RoIs between the aforementioned six Pareto solutions 
with the max-min fairness solution.

In Figure 11.6, we provide Pareto solutions 1 to 5, the proposed fair Pareto opti￾mal solution, and the min-max fairness solution in the Pareto front with the different 
RoIs. The corresponding objective values are shown in Table 11.2. It is obvious that 
both the min-max fairness solution and the proposed fair Pareto solution can provide 
almost the same fair power consumption design across different groups of cells. For 
power consumption fairness design, the RoI of the MOP is Region F, as shown in 
Figure 11.6. However, if the RoI of the designer tends to the minimum power con￾sumption of a specifc group of cells (i.e., Region 2, 3, or 4 in Figure 11.6), then 
the min-max fairness solution and the proposed fair Pareto solution are not the best 
choices in this condition. On the contrary, Pareto solutions 2, 3, and 4 will be suitable 
candidates for Regions 2, 3, and 4. 
For comparison with other design methods, our results are compared with (1) the 
distributed block diagonalization (i.e., distributed BD) [339], which is modifed by 
considering the same SINR constraints in [319–321], and (2) the iteratively weighted 
minimum mean square error (i.e., iterative weighted MMSE) algorithm for the 
sum-utility maximization [306]. Both algorithms are designed for the same scenario 
(i.e., the MIMO interference broadcast channel), as mentioned. In the following, we 
consider Ni = 50 generations and Np = 20 populations of MOEA with the average 
over 100 channel realizations to show the advantage and disadvantage of the pro￾posed algorithm with respect to other algorithms. 
11.6.1 ComParIson of PoWer ConsumPTIon In eaCh grouP 
The power consumption minimization of the beamforming design under the required 
SINR is the key performance area of the proposed multi-objective beamforming 
design. In Figures 11.7 and 11.8, we can observe that the proposed multi-objective 
power consumption minimization method for each group is exactly effective to 
achieve their power minimization purposes. We transform the power into decibels 
to get a better view of the fgures. The iterative weighted MMSE algorithm [306] 
could maximize the total sum transmission rates of all cells. Also, its power budget 
is fxed with respect to the SNR value. As a result, the power consumption of the 
weighted MMSE algorithm increases as the SNR increases. The distributed BD Design for Energy Effciency in MIMO Beamforming System 281

[339] is modifed with enough power to meet the SINR constraints. With different 
groups of cells, we can observe the difference between the Pareto solutions. In Fig￾ure 11.8(b), the total power consumption values of the Pareto solutions are close to 
each other. Since the knee point solution (Pareto solution 1) has the least total power 
consumption, it is reasonable that it consumes the least power compared to other 
Pareto solutions. We can observe that the more cells in the objective, the lower the 
power consumption of the solution. 
11.6.2 TransmIssIon CaPaCITy 
In MIMO wireless communication, it is important to have a better transmission rate 
to transmit data effciently. We defne the total transmission rate for the downlink 
data stream as follows: 
Q K 
åålog det(1+ g ) (11.26) 2 qi 
q=1 i=1 
where g qi
 is the estimated SINR matrix of the user i in the cell q. In Figure 11.9(a), 
we compare the total transmission rate with respect to different values of SNR. The 
throughput of the iterative weighted MMSE algorithm increases with the SNR. With

FIGURE 11.9 (Continued) 
the SINR constraints on the proposed algorithm, the transmission rate of the proposed 
algorithm is kept at a certain level in all SNR conditions. On the contrary, the iterative 
weighted MMSE algorithm achieves a smaller transmission rate in a low SNR but a 
larger transmission rate in high SNR. In other words, the proposed algorithm is more 
reliable in all SNR conditions but lacks the drive to achieve the maximum transmis￾sion rate. Distributed BD is a simple and noniterative method. However, it suffers 
from performance degradation due to zero-forcing constraints. Thus, the distributed 
BD achieves the lowest sum transmission rate compared to the other schemes. 
11.6.3 PoWer ConsumPTIon under dIfferenT ChanneL unCerTaInTy LeveLs 
This section discusses power consumption versus different levels of channel uncer￾tainty in different Pareto solutions of the proposed multi-objective power minimiza￾tion scheme as shown in Figure 11.9(b). We can observe that power minimization 
with less cells consumes more power; that is, Pareto solutions 2 and 4 consume more 
power than Pareto solution 3. Higher power consumption is required to achieve the 
desired SINR constraints with a larger channel uncertainty. This phenomena can also 
be observed in each Pareto optimal solution. 
11.6.4 ComParIson of bIT error raTes 
To compare the equalization performance of the proposed MOP design with other 
methods, we consider the uncoded bit error rate [340] as the performance indica￾tor in Figure 11.10 and Figure 11.11(a). Generally, the bit error rate is the error of Design for Energy Effciency in MIMO Beamforming System 285

Design for Energy Effciency in MIMO Beamforming System 287 
the coded signal (digital signal). The uncoded bit error rate is the bit error rate for 
the signal before being coded (analog signal). We consider the maximum-likelihood 
detection scheme [340] to detect the received signals. For the users in each group, 
there is no difference with the BER at a low SNR. At a high SNR, Pareto solution 
4 with the corresponding group achieves the best BER performance. Pareto solu￾tions 5 (the proposed lowest MMSE equalization) and 1 (knee point) are the second. 
The Pareto solutions of the other groups get the worst BER. It is worth noting that 
the BER in group 2 is worse than that of the other groups. It seems that there is a 
trade-off between power consumption and BER. Generally, the iterative weighted 
MMSE algorithm achieves a worse bit error rate than the proposed Pareto solutions. 
It appears that the BER is infuenced by the lack of SINR constraints. Affected by 
the zero forcing constraints, the distributed BD with the SINR constraint achieves a 
relatively high BER except in Figure 10.10(b). 
11.6.5 effeCT of number of TransmITTIng anTennas 
In this section, we study the impact of the number of transmitting antennas on power 
consumption. Similar to Section 11.6.1, power minimization with more cells in 
a group results in less power consumption. Since the quantity of antennas has an 
impact on multiplex gains, we can observe the relation between the number of trans￾mitting antennas and the total power consumption by the simulation result in Fig. 
11.11(b). Although a large number of transmitting antennas decreases beamforming 
power consumption, it also increases the design complexity. In practical application, 
the trade-off between BER performance and complexity should be taken into account 
in the design procedure. 
11.6.6 TransmIssIon ThroughPuTs 
In Figure 11.12, we investigate the transmission throughput of the proposed algo￾rithm at different SNR levels. According to related research [302, 341], the transmis￾sion throughput is defned as the average data bits (or packets) that are successfully 
received and decoded by the receiver per time slot. If we have the average trans￾mission rate R and the bit error rate B (or packet error rate), then the general trans￾mission throughput can be approximated as (1- B R) . Based on this defnition, both 
the low error rate and high transmission rate are important to achieve the maximum 
transmission throughput. According to Figures 11.9(a) and 11.11(a), we can observe 
that the iterative weighted MMSE algorithm can achieve a high system capacity but 
suffers from a high risk of losing information with large power consumption in the 
high SNR region. Also, the distributed BD has the worst performance due to the 
sum transmission rate degradation. On the contrary, the proposed algorithms keep 
the throughput at a fxed level with a lower BER, which can guarantee transmission 
reliability of the proposed algorithms. As a result, it is more recommendable to apply 
the proposed algorithms to receive information with a minimum power consumption 
in all SNR conditions. 
As a conclusion, we analyze every aspect in the simulation example. Pareto 
solution 5 (the proposed lowest MMSE equalization) is more reliable than other  
288 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
FIGURE 11.12 The total transmission throughputs of all groups versus different SNR levels. 
algorithms. Although Pareto solution 5 consumes more power than Pareto solutions 
3 and 1 with respect to transmitting antenna number and channel uncertainty in Fig￾ure 11.11(b) and Figure 11.9(b), Pareto solution 5 has a better transmission rate and 
low BER. Consequently, we should choose Pareto solution 5 as the preferred Pareto 
solution in the multi-objective power minimization design of the multicell multiuser 
MIMO beamforming system. 
11.7 CONCLUSION 
In this chapter, a multi-objective power minimization beamforming design is intro￾duced for a multicell multiuser MIMO system. An indirect suboptimal MOP is pro￾posed to solve the multi-objective power minimization problem by the proposed 
SDP-constrained MOEA. To search the Pareto optimal solutions in the Pareto front, 
the Pareto optimal solution with the best MMSE equalization is selected as a prefer￾able solution among these Pareto optimal solutions. The simulation example shows 
that the beamforming of Pareto optimal solution with the best MMSE equalization of 
the proposed multi-objective power minimization design algorithm can achieve reli￾able performance with low power. Thus, the proposed SDP-constrained MOEA can 
get the Pareto optimal solution set and provide the designer with a preferred beam￾forming to achieve the minimum power consumption and signal detection error under 
a constrained SINR, which will be useful for energy-effcient communications in the  
 
Design for Energy Effciency in MIMO Beamforming System 289 
future. For future research, we expect to expand the application of multi-objective 
optimization into another design aspect of wireless communication systems. 
11.8 APPENDIX 
11.8.1 Proof of Theorem 11.1 
To prove Theorem 11.1, we choose a straightforward way. The main idea is to prove 
that both inequality constraints in (11.14b) become equality for the Pareto opti￾mal solution. We will prove this by contradiction. Given a Pareto optimal solution * * * ( , a a ...,a ,..., ) of the MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b), we assume that either of the 1 n N 
inequalities in (11.14b) remains a strict inequality in the Pareto optimal solution. 
Without loss of generality, we assume that there exists a feasible solution b such * * * that a > b and å Î Tr(Q ) = b . Then the solution ( , b ...,a ,...,a ) dominates 1 q n N i 1 * * * the original Pareto optimal solution qg i 
( , a a ..., ,...,a ), which leads to a contradiction. 1 n N 
This implies that the inequality constraints in (11.14b) indeed become equalities for 
Pareto optimal solutions in the MOP in (11.14a)–(11.14b). Thus, the indirect MOP in 
(11.14a)–(11.14b) is indeed equivalent to the MOP in (11.12)–(11.13). DOI: 10.1201/9781003362142-15 290

12.1 INTRODUCTION 
For wireless communication systems in the next generation, the extreme demands of 
transmission throughput have triggered extensive investigation of coordinated com￾munication and resource allocation to achieve performance enhancement in wireless 
cellular networks. Since multi-input multi-output transmission can provide an extra 
degree of freedom and spatial diversity, it has received signifcant attention from 
both academia and industry recently [342, 343]. On the other hand, it is well known 
that coordinated multi-point (CoMP) schemes, such as coordinated beamforming 
(CB) and joint processing (JP), could achieve the high quality of service require￾ments even if users suffer from multicell interference at the cell edge in the multicell 
multiuser MIMO (multicell MU-MIMO) system [344–346]. Among different coor￾dinated communications, dirty paper coding (DPC) and block diagonalization (BD) 
(i.e., zero forcing beamforming (ZFBF)) are two kinds of conventional strategies to 
overcome intercell or intracell interference [347, 348]. However, the high complexity 
of DPC and the performance degradation due to noise amplifcation by ZFBF still 
remain a bottleneck in applications [349]. 
For most of the general optimization problems in coordinated beamforming algo￾rithms for MIMO wireless systems, the implementation is to rely on the assumption 
of perfect channel state information from the ideal backhaul link. However, the appli￾cability of these methods decreases with pilot contamination since the transmitter 
only obtains imperfect CSI with feedback delay, estimation error, quantization error, 
and so on [350, 351]. Therefore, it is necessary to consider robust design by taking Multi-Objective Beamforming Power Control 291 
imperfect CSI and delay feedback into account [352]. For multicell or multiuser 
MIMO systems, a lot of research has concerned worst-case and probabilistic robust￾ness [308, 349, 353–357]. Specifcally, a study considered an outage probabilistic 
robust beamforming design for a multicell MIMO wireless system with a maximiz￾ing sum outage rate in [308]. Joint beamforming and broadcasting (JBB) methods 
have been investigated for massive MIMO systems in the case where one group of 
terminals cannot obtain CSI in the system [355]. In [356], with a single antenna 
receiver for each user, imperfect CSI is modelled within an upper bound with a 
Euclidean norm; then the authors use semidefnite relaxation and second-order cone 
(SOC) constraints to formulate a robust design in the MIMO relay system. A novel 
algorithm of precoding and detection methods for a nonorthogonal multiple access 
MIMO system is developed and the outage probability for performance enhancement 
is investigated in [357]. In [349], the delay effect in a feedback loop and mismatch￾ing CSI are modeled to achieve a robust signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) 
beamforming in the MU-MIMO system. 
Moreover, to overcome interference, some research has paid attention to the 
design of power control problems for SINR target tracking in the past decade [330, 
358–363]. For instance, energy-effcient robust transceiver design considering imper￾fect channels with the assumption of norm-bounded uncertainty for power control 
problems has been developed by minimizing interference leakage [330]. Generally, 
we can divide power control schemes for SINR target tracking into two categories: 
centralized [361] and decentralized [14, 359, 360, 362] autonomous power control 
schemes. Compared to the centralized scheme, decentralized power control only 
needs local measurements for each transmitter so that all users will satisfy the desired 
QoS requirement [330, 359]. In the proposed power control method, each transmitter 
only needs local CSI and measures the SINR to generate tracking control commands 
without the uncertainty of upper-bound information for SINR target tracking, which 
is more realistic than conventional methods for interference wireless systems. 
Multi-Objective designs are more attractive than single-objective designs for the 
next generation of wireless communication networks to achieve multiple design pur￾poses inherently [326, 327, 363–365]. Recently, two general algorithms have been 
developed to resolve multi-objective optimization problems. One is the classical 
algorithm using weighted methods [327, 364, 365], the another is the multi-objective 
heuristic algorithm [2, 325, 366–368]. The basic idea of the weighted method is to 
provide several weighting factors and combine the corresponding objective values 
into a single objective problem. For the multi-objective heuristic algorithm, some 
popular approaches can be divided into several categories, such as multi-objective 
evolution algorithms, multi-objective immune algorithms (MOIAs) [325], and multi￾objective simulated annealing (MOSA), which consist of a nondominated sorting 
genetic algorithm [2], hybrid multi-objective immune algorithm [366], and archived 
multi-objective simulated annealing (AMOSA) [367]. MOEAs, MOIAs, and 
MOSAs provide us a set of Pareto optimal solutions based on common goals, which 
are reliable and fast converging to the Pareto optimal set with a uniform distribution 
of Pareto solutions along the Pareto front [369]. For the proposed MOPs to achieve 
SINR target tracking, a linear matrix inequality–constrained MOEA is proposed in 
this chapter to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions parallelly. 292 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
In this chapter, we consider a multi-objective robust beamforming power control 
scheme introduced to achieve optimal robust H2/H∞ SINR target tracking performance 
with the minimum power consumption for each user in the multicell MU-MIMO wire￾less system. The three objectives of the introduced design method with SINR target 
tracking are as follows: (1) achieving optimal H∞ robust SINR target tracking perfor￾mance to effciently resist the worst-case effect of external disturbance (i.e., fuctuation 
of interference) without statistical information of uncertainty. (2) Achieving optimal 
H2 SINR target tracking performance to minimize the mean square tracking error. (3) 
Achieving the minimum average power consumption performance for power effciency 
to decrease the energy cost in power control command. For the robust optimal H2/H∞ 
SINR target tracking scheme [9], the worst-case effect of channel fading, channel 
uncertainty, SINR target levels, and round trip delay should be minimized. Most impor￾tantly, rather than the conventional robust design for imperfect CSI with norm-bounded 
uncertain information, the proposed robust H2/H∞ SINR target tracking scheme does 
not need to know the statistical property or the upper bound information of channel 
uncertainty. This method can transfer the proposed multi-objective robust H2/H∞ SINR 
target tracking problem into an offine LMI-constrained MOP to simplify the design 
procedure. Then an LMI-constrained MOEA is developed to obtain the Pareto optimal 
solutions for the MOP effciently. Up to this, the offine MOP to achieve a robust optimal 
H2/H∞ SINR target tracking with the minimum average power consumption simultane￾ously for the improvement of QoS and power effciency can be solved by the preferable 
Pareto optimal solution. Finally, the online SINR target tracking system can update the 
beamforming control command by the offine design Pareto optimal design. According 
to the foregoing beamforming control command, the system designer can acquire the 
corresponding beamforming matrices by solving the decentralized semi-defnite pro￾gramming process under the leakage interference constraints. 
The main purposes of this chapter are as follows: 
• Without the requirement of statistical property and upper bound informa￾tion of channel uncertainty, the dynamic power control scheme with an 
offine design procedure is combined with an online beamforming opti￾mization method in the multicell MU-MIMO wireless system to achieve 
robust SINR target tracking design. 
• The Pareto front of the multi-objective H2/H∞ robust SINR target tracking 
design problem can be investigated with an optimal power effciency, that is, 
a MOP to minimize (1) the worst-case effect of the channel uncertainty in 
the robust H∞ sense, (2) the mean square error on SINR target tracking per￾formance, and (3) minimum average power consumption simultaneously. 
• The aforementioned MOP is diffcult to solve in general due to the unknown 
channel uncertainty without the upper bound information. We transform 
the aforementioned MOP into an offine design LMI-constrained MOP, 
which can be solved effciently with the help of an interior point method. 
• An LMI-constrained MOEA is further developed to provide a parallel 
search scheme with convergence to the Pareto optimal solutions of the pro￾posed multi-objective beamforming power control with good distribution 
along the Pareto front.  
 
Multi-Objective Beamforming Power Control 293 
This chapter is divided into six sections as follows: in Section 12.2, we introduce 
the system model and the SINR target tracking model for the multicell MU-MIMO 
wireless system. In Section 12.3, the multi-objective optimization problem is turned 
into an LMI-constrained MOP. After we formulate the LMI-constrained MOP for 
the optimal robust H2/H∞ SINR target tracking problem with the optimal power eff￾ciency, an LMI-constrained MOEA is developed to fnd the Pareto optimal solutions 
in Section 12.4. In Section 12.5, some simulation results are given for simulated 
scenarios of the proposed design procedure. Section 12.6 draws conclusions.

12.2 SYSTEM MODEL FOR ROBUST BEAMFORMING POWER 
CONTROL DESIGN IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM 
The proposed multi-objective robust beamforming power control design includes 
three objectives: (1) optimal H∞ robust SINR target tracking performance, (2) opti￾mal H2 SINR target tracking performance, and (3) the minimum average power con￾sumption in the multicell multiuser MIMO wireless system. After the beamforming 
power command is specifed by the proposed SINR tracking system model, it will 
be transferred to a semidefnite programming block to fnd the beamforming matrix. 
In this section, the SINR tracking system model for the multi-objective SINR tar￾get tracking design is proposed to prepare for the beamforming control design in 
Section 12.3.

We consider the downlink multicell multiuser MIMO interference wireless system, 
as shown in Figure 12.1. All base stations serve multiple users at the same frequency 
[348] (i.e., each user will suffer from intracell and intercell interference). The mul￾ticell MU-MIMO wireless system includes Q cells. The qth cell is equipped with a 
multiple antenna base station, which transmits independent data streams to the Kq 
remote users in its coverage range. Each user has multiple receiving antennas. We 
denotes Nt and Nr as the transmitted antenna number of base station and the received 
antenna number of the user equipment, respectively. According to the related research q N ´1 t [348], let r t() = åK

In fact, the base stations only obtain imperfect CSI in the multicell MU-MIMO 
wireless system due to feedback delay, estimation error, quantization error, and so 
on. Thus, channel imperfection exists in all the estimated channel matrices of the 
multicell MU-MIMO wireless system. The channel imperfection of all the channel 
matrices H ( )t , "r q i rqi 
,, , can be expressed as: 
° H t () = Hrq ( )t + DH t ( ), " r q, , i (12.3) rq i rq i i 
where H ˆ ( )t is the estimated channel matrix, and DH ( )t is the channel uncertain rqi rqi 
matrix. According to (12.3), we defne the following SINR expression with instan￾taneous imperfect CSI of the ith user at the qth cell for the multicell MU-MIMO 
wireless system:

Some researchers may suggest that the main channel uncertain term H ( )t W t( ) qq q i i 
could be included in the denominator of (12.4). In this chapter, we only consider theF 
uncertainty other than the main channel uncertain term to have SINR expression with 
imperfect CSI in (12.4), which is similar to the existing robust beamforming design [333].

where z t() Î ˙ is the beamforming control command to specify the power level qi

presents the measured SINR of the ith user in the qth cell; and the external distur￾bance v t() Î ˙ includes the power of channel uncertainty, interference, and the qi

Remark 12.1: Note that after the beamforming control command z t( ) is gener- qi 
ated by the SINR tracking system (i.e., the beamforming control gain k ), as shown in 
Figure 12.2, we still need to fnd the beamforming matrix W t( ) to match the beam- qi 
forming control command z t( ) in (12.7). The optimization method of semi-defnite qi 
programming to fnd the beamforming matrix W t( ) will be discussed after the mul- qi

command z t( ) in Section 12.4, that is, the optimal H∞ robust SINR target tracking qi 
performance, the optimal H2 SINR target tracking performance, and the minimum 
average power consumption for each user in the multicell MIMO wireless systems. 
12.2.2 sInr TargeT TraCkIng sysTem modeL 
According to (12.9) and (12.10), the SINR measurement level y t() for the ith user qi 
in the qth cell can be represented as (12.9), and the updated beamforming control 
commands can be expressed as (12.10). Assume that we want to achieve the spe￾cifc downlink SINR level a q ( )t Î ˙ to satisfy a required QoS for the measurement i 
SINR, as shown in Figure 12.2, in the multicell MU-MIMO wireless system; the 
tracking error e t( ) for y t( ) to target SINR level a ( )t can be expressed as: q q q i i i 
e t() = a ( )t - y t( ) (12.11) q q q i i i 
Note that for the transmitter, the tracking error e t( ) should be regarded as the qi 
feedback signal and be used to calculate the power control command u t( ). From qi 
(12.9)–(12.11), we have the following SINR tracking control equation of the ith user 
in the qth cell: 
e t() = e t( - - 1) e t( - + 1) e t( ) q q q q i i i i 
= e t( - + 1 ) a ( )t -a (t - + 1) y (t - - 1) y () t (12.12) q q q q q i i i i i

where z (t - = 1 ) a () t -a (t - + 1 ) v t() - v t( -1) denotes the changes of the target q q q q q i i i i i 
SINR level a ( )t and the external disturbance v t( ). These fuctuations must be mod- q q i i 
eled as the disturbances in the SINR tracking error system in (12.12). We assume that all 
of the power control commands u t() in the past must be combined with the beamform- qi 
ing control command z t( ) and the error term e t( ) for the ith user in the qth cell as: q q i i

For the SINR tracking model of the beamforming power control problem in the mul￾ticell MU-MIMO wireless system, we assume that the feedback beamforming con- 1 (d Î ´ +1 trol gain k ˙ )
 exists in each base station. Thus, the power control command 
u t( ) can be designed as the state feedback scheme by the offine design beamform- qi 
ing control gain k : 
u t() = kx () t (12.18) q q i i 
Since system matrices A, b, c, d, and g are all the same for all users, the designer 
can specify the same beamforming control gain k with offine design process to 
make the tracking error e t( ) as small as possible despite the disturbance z ( )t in q q i i 
(12.14). By substituting (12.18) into (12.14), the SINR tracking system of the multi￾cell MU-MIMO wireless system with control gain is presented as:

Multi-Objective Beamforming Power Control 299 
Up to this, the SINR tracking system model for robust beamforming power control 
design in the multicell MU-MIMO wireless system is completed. In the next section, 
the multi-objective optimal H2/H∞ SINR target tracking problem with the minimum 
power consumption is formulated to fnd the Pareto optimal solution of the multi-ob￾jective beamforming control gain k . 
12.3 PROBLEM FORMULATION 
The purpose of this section is to design the multi-objective beamforming control 
gain k to achieve optimal robust H2/H∞ SINR target tracking performance with the 
minimum average power consumption simultaneously of the SINR tracking system 
in (12.19) for the multicell MU-MIMO wireless system. First, the H∞ robust SINR 
tracking system in (12.19) is defned to avoid the effect of the disturbance power on 
the SINR tracking performance as follows [9]: 
2 2 E q{ e t( ) + r u ( t)} 1 q 1 q J u( (t)) = i i (12.20) ¥ qi 2 E z q { (t)} i 
where the weighted factors qi Î ˙ and r
1 Î ˙ are positive constants and represent 
the trade-off between power control command u t( ) and tracking error e t( ). The q q i i 
meaning of (12.20) is that the effect of the disturbance z q ( )t on the tracking error i 
e t( ) and the updated power command u t( ) is considered from the average energy q q i i 
of view. Since the disturbances of multipath fading are unpredictable in the MIMO 
wireless system, the H∞ robust SINR target tracking design is considered from the 
worst-case effect of disturbance. 
For the given SINR tracking system in (12.19), the H2 optimal SINR target track￾ing performance index J u( (t)) [9] with external disturbance z ( )t = 0 for the 2 q q i i 
SINR tracking system in (12.19) can be expressed as: 
J u(( t)) = E{ q e ( t +1 2 )} (12.21) 2 q 2 q i i 
where the positive weighted factor q2 Î ˙. The expression of (12.21) is seen as the mean 
square SINR target tracking error e t( +1). Moreover, the average power consumption qi 
performance index J u(( t))for the given SINR tracking system in (12.19) is defned p qi 
as the following to save the power cost in the multicell MU-MIMO wireless system: 
2 J u( (t)) = E{q u ( t)} (12.22) p qi 3 qi 
where the positive weighted factor q3 Î ˙. The meaning of (12.22) is the updated 
power consumption from the average point of view by (12.10). According to (12.20)– 
(12.22), the design problem to achieve the multi-objective optimal robust H2/H∞ 
tracking performance with the minimum power consumption of the SINR tracking 
target system in (12.19) for the multicell MU-MIMO wireless beamforming system 
can be expressed as follows: 
Problem 12.1: The multi-objective optimal H2/H∞ tracking problem with the min￾imum average power consumption of the given SINR tracking system in (12.19) is 300 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
to design the admissible power control command u t( ) in (12.18) to achieve the qi 
following multi-objective tracking performance simultaneously: 
min{ J u( (t J )), ( ( ut )), J u( (t))} ¥ q 2 q p q i i i u t q ( )Îf i (12.23) 
subject to (12.14) 
where f is the feasible set of all updated power commands u t( ) satisfying the state qi 
feedback scheme in (12.18) for the SINR target tracking system in (12.14). 
Before further discussions of solving the MOP in (12.23), some fundamental con￾cepts of MOPs need to be introduced. 
Defnition 12.1 ([368, 369]): (Pareto dominance) For two feasible solutions 
u t( ) and ut ¢ ( ) corresponding to two objective values ((( J u t J )), (( ut )), q qi ¥ q 2 q i i i 
J u( (t ))) and ( ( Ju ( t J )), ( u t ¢ ( )),J u( ¢ ( t))), respectively, the solution ¢ p q ¥ qi 2 qi p qi i 
u t( ) is said to dominate ut ( ( ) £ ( ¢ ( ) if J u t J u t ¢ ( )), J u( (t J ) £ ( ut ¢ ( )), q qi ¥ q ¥ qi 2 q 2 qi i i i 
and J u( (t) £ J (u t ¢ ( )), and at least one of the inequalities is a strict p qi p qi 
inequality. 
Defnition 12.2 ([368, 369]): (Pareto optimality) The feasible solution u t( ) is qi 
said to be Pareto optimality with respect to the feasible set f if and only if 
there does not exist another feasible solution that dominates it. 
Defnition 12.3 ([368, 369]): (Pareto optimal set) For a given MOP in (12.23), 
the Pareto optimal solution set d se 
* 
t is defned as 
* * d { ( u t) Îf set qi 
* u t( ) is Pareto optimality} qi 
Defnition 12.4 ([368, 369]): (Pareto front) For a given MOP in (12.23) and the 
Pareto optimal solution set d se 
* 
t , the Pareto front F*
 is defned as 
* * * * F ˆ {(J ( ( ut )), J u( (t J )), (( u t))) ¥ q 2 q p q i i i 
* u t( )) Îd* } q set i 
In general, it is not easy to solve the multi-objective SINR target tracking problem in 
(12.23) by conventional methods directly. An indirect method is proposed to solve it 
in the following. 
Theorem 12.1: Assume that b , g , and d are the upper bounds of the performance 
indices in (12.20)–(12.21), respectively. Then the multi-objective SINR target track￾ing problem in (12.23) is equivalent to the following suboptimal tracking problem in 
the Pareto optimal sense:

J u( (t)) £ g (12.27) 2 qi 
J u( (t)) £ d (12.28) p qi 
Proof: To derive this result, we only need to prove that all of the inequality con￾straints in (12.26)–(12.28) become equalities when the MOP in (12.24) achieves 
Pareto optimal solutions. We will show the result by contradiction. Given a 4-tuple * * * * optimal solution vector ( ( u t), b g,, d ) for the MOP in (12.24)–(12.28), we qi 
assume that the inequality in (12.26) remains the strict inequality at the Pareto opti- * mal solution, that is, J u( (t )) < b b * . Therefore, there exists another lower bound ˆ ¥ qi 
ˆ * ° * ° * * such that bb < ( ( )) = b. It is obvious that the solution (( ), b g d ) * and J u t ut , , ¥ q q i i
* * * * dominates the solution (( ut ), b g,, d ), leading to a contradiction. Similarly, the qi 
inequalities in (12.27)–(12.28) will become equalities when the Pareto optimal solu￾tions are achieved. Thus, we can guarantee that the inequalities in (12.26)–(12.28) 
become equalities for the Pareto optimal solutions in (12.24). This implies that the 
suboptimal solution in (12.24)–(12.28) is equivalent to the Pareto optimal solution 
in (12.23). 
Theorem 12.1 provides an indirect method to solve the multi-objective SINR tar￾get tracking problem in (12.23). According to (12.24)–(12.28), the inequality con￾straint on robust H∞ tracking performance in (12.26) is equivalent to the following 
inequality:

where t is the transmitted signal length. From (12.19), by substituting e t() = dx t( ) e q q i i 
and considering the effect of the initial condition, that is, xq ( ) 0 ¹ 0, (12.29) can be i 
modifed as:

for the symmetric positive defnite matrix P > 0. The following theorem will provide 
suffcient conditions for the control command u t() to solve the MOP in (12.23) or qi 
(12.24)–(12.28). 
Theorem 12.2: Let us denote the Lyapunov function V x( (t)) = x t Px t( ) T ( ) q q q i i i 
of the SINR tracking control system in (12.19) for P PT > = -1 = 0. If we let WP 
and y k = W = W -1 , or k y subject to (12.14) and (12.18), then the inequality con￾straint in (12.26) could be transformed into (12.31), the inequality constraint in 
(12.27) could be transformed into (12.32) and (12.33), and the inequality constraint 
(12.28) could be transformed into the inequality constraints in (12.34) and (12.35). ú

Proof: Please refer to Appendix 12.7.1. 
According to Theorem 12.2, the inequality constraints in (12.26)–(12.28) can 
be replaced by the LMIs in (12.31)–(12.35). Thus, the multi-objective SINR target 
tracking problem in (12.23) can be transformed into the following LMI-constrained 
multi-objective optimization problem: 
* * * ( , b g ,) d = min ( , b g d, )
{ , W y}Îh (12.36) 
subject to the LMIs in (12.31) - (12.35) 
where h is the feasible set. 
Remark 12.2: For the MOP in (12.36), the robust optimal H∞ SINR target track￾ing problem to minimize (12.20) can be reduced as the following single-objective 
optimization problem: 
b L = min b { , Wy } (12.37) 
subject to the LMI in (12.31) 
The optimal H2 SINR target tracking problem to minimize (12.21) can be reduced as 
the following SOP: 
g L = ming { , W y} (12.38) 
subject to the LMIs in (12.32) - (12.33)  
Multi-Objective Beamforming Power Control 303 
The minimum average power consumption for the SINR target tracking problem to 
minimize (12.22) can be reduced as the following SOP: 
d = mind 
{ , } L Wy (12.39) 
subject to the LMIs in (12.34) - (12.35) 
Normally, we have b* ³ b L , g * ³ g L, and d* ³ d L of the Pareto optimal solutions 
( , * * ,) L , g L , and d L b g d can be used as the lower bounds * for the MOP in (12.36). b 
of b* 
, g *
, and d*
, respectively. Thus, we have the following defnition: 
Defnition 12.5: (Ideal Objective Index) The ideal objective index (, b g , ) d L L L 
for the MOP in (12.36) is defned as the optimal objective indices of the LMI-con￾strained SOPs in (12.37)–(12.39), respectively. 
Now, the feasible solutions of the LMI-constrained MOP in (12.36) are offine, 
obtained by the convex optimization toolbox in MATLAB for the given b , g , 
and d subject to the LMIs in (12.31)–(12.35) with W and y. We could design the 
multi-objective beamforming control gain ky 1 = W offine to generate power control -
command u t i
() = kx t i
( ) for each user and build the beamforming control command q q 
z t( ) from (12.10). Note that for the general MOP, the unique global solution does qi 
not exist for optimality. However, we can obtain a preferred Pareto optimal solution 
set of (12.36) in the sense of MOP. In the next section, we will introduce the LMI￾constrained MOEA to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions for the MOP in (12.36). 
12.4 PARETO OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS TO MULTI￾OBJECTIVE BEAMFORMING CONTROL DESIGN 
Up to this, the beamforming control gain k can achieve the multi-objective SINR tar￾get tracking performance by solving the LMI-constrained MOP in (12.36). As shown 
in Figure 12.2, the purpose of the SINR tracking system through the power control 
command u t() = kx ( )t is to generate the beamforming control command z t( ) in q q q i i i 
(12.10), then transfer it into the online semi-defnite programming part to obtain 
the corresponding beamforming matrix W t( ) from (12.7). In this section, we will qi 
introduce how to combine LMIs and MOEA to effciently solve the MOP in (12.36). 
12.4.1 LmI-ConsTraIned moeas 
A conventional MOEA is a practical scheme based on the evolution process and 
natural selection. For wireless communication networks, MOEAs have been seen 
as a possible candidate for solving the MOP of beamforming control design due 
to avoiding local optima with effective search of the Pareto optimal solutions. Dif￾ferent from the traditional algebra-constrained MOEA searches, the objective val- * * * ues ( , b g , ) d with the help of interior point methods, in this chapter, we choose 
NSGA-II as the structural basis of the algorithm [2]. The MOEA frst encodes 
the individuals (, b g ,) d for all n = 1,..., N as the initial parent population P in n n n p r 
the feasible set, where the initial iteration number is set as r = 1. The symbol Pr is 304 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
the population at the rth iteration. That is, the nth individual (, b g , ) d must satisfy n n n 
the LMIs in (12.31)–(12.35) withb ³ b ³ b , g ³ g ³ g , and d ³ d ³ d for all U n L U n L U n L 
n = 1,..., N , where N is the population size. b , g , and d are the upper bounds of p p U U U 
each objective value in ( , b g , ) d , respectively. Note that infeasible individuals need * * to be excluded from the candidate set. Finally, the Pareto optimal solutions (W y, ) * * * - with multi-objective beamforming control gain k = y (W ) 1
 can also be obtained 
after achieving the set of approximate the Pareto front F* . The algorithm of the 
LMI-constrained MOEA to solve the MOP in (12.36) is summarized in Algorithm * * * 12.1. Once the preferable objective values ( , b g , ) d are selected, the correspond- * * ing Pareto optimal solution (W y, ) can also be obtained with the help of the LMI 
toolbox in MATLAB. 
Remark 12.3: The proposed LMI-constrained MOEA in Algorithm 12.1 indeed 
converges to the Pareto front (i.e., the Pareto optimal set) when the iteration number 
N ® ¥. m 
Proof: First, in each iteration of the proposed algorithm, the infeasible solutions 
of the LMI-constrained MOP in (12.36) will be deleted from the candidate set. Thus,

the search region of the proposed algorithm is within the feasible set of the MOP. 
Denote F P( )r as the objective set of the rth iteration (i.e., the set consists of all the 
objective indices (, b g ,) d , "= n 1,..., N of the candidate solution in the r th iter- n n n p 
ation). The candidate population set Pr consists of Np feasible solutions in the rth 
iteration. In each iteration, Algorithm 12.1 will combine Np parent solutions in the 
previous iteration with Np child solutions as a new population set with 2Np solu￾tions. Next, Algorithm 12.1 performs an elitist strategy to select half of the better Np 
solutions in this new population set as the input of the next iteration [2]. “The better 
solution” means that the solution dominates another solution in the original popula￾tion according to Defnition 12.1. Thus, we have 
FP ()  F P( ),"= r 1 ,..., N (12.40) r r-1 m 
where Nm is the iteration number. The operator  in (12.40) means that at least 
one of the solutions in Pr dominates the solutions in Pr-1 , that is, the nondominated 
sorting algorithm in the MOEA [2]. We can make sure that the objective set will 
be better than the previous iterations or keep the same in the proposed Algorithm 
12.1 (i.e., F P()  F P( ), F P()  F P( ), F P()  F P( ), and so on). According to 1 0 2 1 3 2 
the monotone sequence convergence theorem in real analysis, we can conclude that 
the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA in Algorithm 12.1 will indeed converge to the 
Pareto front (i.e., the Pareto optimal set) when Nm ® ¥. 
Regarding the feasibility of the proposed multi-objective approach, we assume 
that there is a feasible solution ( , W y) for the LMIs in (12.31)–(12.35) with the spe￾cifc transmitted signal length te = t e . 
Theorem 12.3: If the LMI-constrained MOPs in (12.36) with te = t e are feasible, 
the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA presented in Algorithm 12.1 always produces 
feasible solutions for te = t e . 
Proof: Let ( , W y, , b g , , d t e ) present a feasible solution of the LMI-constrained 
MOP in (12.36). Defne 
G( )e = W y,, te t (, b g ,, d ) (12.41) 
and hence G( )e indicates the feasible solution ( , W y b g ,, d e t ,, t ). The proof of the the￾orem is to show that the solution G( )et satisfes the constraints in (12.31)–(12.35) for
all t ³ t . The feasibility of G( ) t implies that the constraints in (12.31)–(12.32) and e e e 
(12.34)–(12.35) are satisfed by G( )e , as t e t is not contained in (12.31)–(12.32) and 
(12.34)–(12.35). According to (12.33), for all te ³ t e, we have the fact that 
T -1 T -1 (t +1)g - x ( ) 0 Wx ( ) 0 ³ (t +1)g - x ( ) 0 Wx ( ) 0 ³ 0 (12.42) e q q e q q i i i i 
The inequality in (12.42) implies that (12.33) is satisfed by G( )e t , which completes
the proof. 
Theorem 12.3 provides us an effcient way to specify the transmitted signal length 
t . Once a feasible solution G( ) t is chosen, the LMI-constrained MOP with t ³ t e e e e 
also guarantees feasibility.

Remark 12.4: After the offine design beamforming control gain k is generated by 
the proposed multi-objective optimization algorithm, the beamforming matrix W t( ) qi 
still needs to be specifed to satisfy the equation in (12.7) after the beamforming 
control command z t( ) is generated by the equation in (12.10). Here we employ qi

in the second constraint of (12.43) is to weaken the leakage interference power for 
an acceptable link quality in the SINR target tracking. The meaning of the objective 
function in (12.43) is to minimize the beamforming power for the ith user in time 
slot t. This kind of quadratic optimization problem in (12.43) can be easily solved by 
semi-defnite relaxation methods [36]. After some rearrangements with a new matrix H variable G t() = W t( )W t( ), we have the following decentralized SDP to solve the q q q i i i 
quadratic optimization problem in (12.43) [36]:

Remark 12.5: The proposed SINR target tracking scheme includes two design 
steps, the offine multi-objective controller gain design process and the online beam￾forming update process in the downlink transmission. We will analyze the computa￾tional complexity of these two steps point by point as follows: 
(1) The LMI-constrained MOEA for the offine design controller gain K: The 
computational complexity of the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA (i.e., the 
Algorithm 12.1) is approximately estimated as O d + )(d + 2)Np 
2 Nm (( 1 ), includ- (d+1)(d+2) 2 ing O( ) for solving the LMIs and O N (2 N ) for the MOEA, where 2 p m 
(d+ ´) d +1 is the dimension of the system state x t() Î ˙ 1 1 in (12.13). qi  
 
Multi-Objective Beamforming Power Control 307 
(2) The online update semidefnite programming in (12.44): We assume that the 
transmitted symbol numbers Lqi
 are set the same as L for all users (Lqi 
= L, 
"q i, ), and each cell has the same user number (i.e., Kq = U, "q). Thus, the 
computational complexity of the proposed SDP in (12.44) is estimated as 
O QU N( t 
2 ( )log( 1 / ) e )including QU separated optimizations to obtain QU
beamforming matrices, where e is the desired accuracy of the solution [371]. 
Remark 12.6: According to Remark 12.5, online computational complexity is 
mainly from semi-defnite programming. When the network dimension is large, the 
computational time of solving the SDP optimization problems may not be small 
enough within the coherence time to overcome fast small-scale fading. Although 
SDP optimization can be solved in polynomial time, the computational time will 
be high under a large number of variables. This is the inherent bottleneck of SDP 
optimization. But, even so, the proposed multi-objective beamforming power control 
algorithm is still a good solution to produce training data for a deep learning frame￾work for a massive MIMO wireless system, such as the related research in [372]. 
According to [372], the outputs of the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) 
(which is named PowerNet) are the pilot and the data powers for the massive MIMO 
system. Thus, the proposed multi-objective beamforming power control algorithm 
can provide a suitable training data set for PowerNet. After PowerNet is completely 
trained, the computing unit of the proposed algorithm can be replaced by this deep 
CNN with less computational complexity. 
12.5 SIMULATION RESULTS 
To illustrate the proposed multi-objective SINR target tracking, a conventional mul￾ticell MU-MIMO interference wireless system is designed to guarantee the optimal 
H∞ SINR target tracking and QoS performance with the minimum average power 
consumption simultaneously. The signifcant system parameters are summarized in 
Table 12.1. The path loss model is according to the non-light of sight (NLOS) urban 
micro-scenario in release document 9 from signal generation partnership project [373], 
which is defned as 36 . l 7 og () D + 22 7. l + 26 og ( ) f . The symbol D is the distance 10 10 c 
in meters, and fc is the frequency in GHz. The multicell MU-MIMO wireless system 
includes two cells with Q = 2, Nc = 2, and Nt = 10. Each cell consists of four users, 
that is, Kq = 4, "q. The cell radius is 400m, and the reference distance is 50m. Each 
receiver is uniformly distributed between the reference distance and the cell radius in 
each cell. To evaluate the effect of noise power on the proposed SINR target track￾2 
ing system, we defne the normalized noise power level No as No = r q 
2 Hqq ( )t , i i F 
"q i, . According to [354], the uncertain channel matrix DHrqi 
( )t can be generated 
by independent and identically distributed complex Gaussian distribution. Thus, we 
generate the uncertain channel matrix by DHrq ( )t = L2 Hrq ( )t Hrq ( )t , where each i i F i
element of the matrix Hrqi 
( )t follows i.i.d. standard complex Gaussian distribution 
with unit variance. The scalar L2
 with 0 < L2 < 1 indicates the effect of channel 
uncertainty level from small to large. All of the actual channel matrices are generated * * * *

the reliability of the result. The weighting factors q1, r
1, q2 , and q3 in Theorem 12.2 
can be used as the free design parameters, which represent the trade-off between 
the system response and the tracking error performance. In the simulation, we set 
x ( ) 0 = [ , , ]T 1000 , q = 0 00008 . , r = 0.0003, q = 0.00001, q = 1, and t = 1000, and i 1 1 2 3 e 
the corresponding Pareto optimal control gain k* can thus be obtained by solving 
the MOP in (12.36), as shown in Table 12.2. The interference power levels Eq for

all i = 1,...,U are the same, with a value of –30dBm. We frst introduce the simulation 
settings of the LMI-constrained MOEA and demonstrate that the Pareto front F*

12.5.1 sImuLaTIon seTTIngs for The moea 
In this subsection, the simulation settings for the LMI-constrained MOEA in Sec￾tion 12.4 are given as follows: we set the maximum iteration number Nm = 100, the 
population size Np = 3000, the crossover probability Mc = 0 9. , mutation probability 
Mm = 0 3. , distribution index for simulating binary crossover h c = 10, and the dis￾tribution index for mutation operator h m = 10. In all of the simulations, we use the 
proposed LMI-constrained MOEA to search for a set of the Pareto front F* , the pref- * * * erable Pareto optimal solution (W y, ), and hence the beamforming control gain k . 
According to the proposed design procedure, the Pareto optimal solutions indeed 
approach the Pareto front effciently, as shown in Figure 12.3. Moreover, the trade-off 
between each Pareto optimal solution becomes more pronounced when the Pareto 
front approaches the ideal objective index, as shown in Figure 12.3. The solution 
diversity also performs well, which guarantees the effectiveness of the proposed 
multi-objective optimization method. For performance comparison, we choose four 
Pareto optimal solutions as the preferable design schemes for the beamforming con￾trol design. We can say that solution 1 makes a compromise between the robust H∞ 
solution, the optimal H2 solution, and the average power consumption solution. Solu￾tion 2 tends to the robust H∞ solution in (12.37), solution 3 tends to the optimal H2 
solution in (12.38), and solution 4 tends to the average power consumption solution in 
FIGURE 12.3 The Pareto front obtained from the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA with 
given weighted factors q1 , q2 , q3 , r

solutions are selected for comparison, as shown in the following fgures. The curve ftting 
process by the MATLAB toolbox is also implemented to declare the trade-off region in the 
Pareto front. 310 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
(12.39). After the beamforming control gain k*
 is obtained, we can use the MATLAB * toolbox YALMIP with MOSEK to obtain the optimal beam-forming matrix W t( ) by qi 
solving the optimization problem in (12.44) for each user [375, 376]. 
12.5.2 PerformanCe sTudy 
In this section, we shall compare the performance of different Pareto optimal solu￾tions by the proposed multi-objective SINR target tracking scheme with other beam￾forming methods. Since the block diagonalization with water-flling method is a 
popular and conventional strategy for MIMO beamforming design, we choose BD 
with equal transmittal power for each user and the traditional water-flling block 
diagonalization (WFBD) [348] of the multicell case as two baseline schemes in the 
simulation with total transmittal power Pt = 30 dbm and Pt = 40 dbm. On the other 
hand, the practical QoS requirement in the next generation of wireless systems may 
require dynamic changes in different time periods. In view of this, we consider two 
cases to show the effciency of the proposed methods, fxed target SINR and changed 
target SINR conditions. For the case of fxed target SINR, we denote the target SINR 
levels a ( )t as the same for all users with a typical value a ( )t = a( )t = 10 dB to qi qi 
ensure an acceptable QoS. For the case of changed target SINR, the target SINR level 
is set as a time-varying sinusoidal function, a t 55 0 05 ) qi 
() = + sin( . t , "q, "i . 
To compare SINR tracking ability with different methods, we defne the standard 
deviation s e of tracking error with measured SINR SINR( )t as the tracking error 
performance criterion: 
s e = T

where T is the total transmitted length and is set as 1000 for all simulations. On the 
other hand, outages may arise for communication and result in instantaneous exacer￾bation of the QoS when the measured SINR goes below an outage threshold. Thus, 
we can also evaluate the quality of the communication link by the outage probability 
as follows: 
Pout = Pr{SINR t( ) £ SINRout } (12.46) 
where SINRout is the outage threshold and is set as 0 dB in our performance evalua￾tion. 
Figure 12.4 shows the tracking error performance s e versus the uncertainty level 
L2 of the four aforementioned Pareto optimal solutions with the fxed and changed 
target SINR conditions. For each case, the normalized noise power level No is set 
as -25 dB. Specifcally, since the Pareto solution 2 (i.e., the robust H∞ solution) 
prioritizes consideration of the worst-case effect on SINR target tracking, the track￾ing error performance (i.e., s e ) is the top among the four Pareto solutions with the 
fxed target SINR condition. For Pareto solution 3 (i.e., the optimal H2 solution), it is 
obvious that its tracking error performance will be better than that of Pareto solution 
2 due to concern about the mean square SINR target tracking error performance.

Pareto solution 1 is a compromise between three objectives; thus its tracking error 
performance will naturally be lower than the aforementioned Pareto solutions in the 
fxed target SINR condition. Interestingly, the tracking error performance of Pareto 
solution 4 (i.e., the power effcient solution) is the greatest among the four Pareto 
solutions with a changed target SINR condition. The reason is that the SINR target 
tracking ability of Pareto solution 4 is diffcult to catch up the change of dynamic 
target SINR level with the minimum power consumption. For the other three Pareto 
solutions with the changed target SINR condition, the tendency of the tracking error 
performance is similar to the cases with a fxed target SINR condition, which demon￾strates the different design purposes among the four Pareto solutions on SINR target 
tracking. 
For comparison between different normalized noise power levels and fast fading 
conditions on SINR target tracking, Figures 12.5 and 12.6 show the tracking error 
performance versus different normalized noise power levels No of the four Pareto 
optimal solutions with the fxed and changed target SINR conditions, respectively. 
Due to the change of noise power, it can be observed reasonably that the tracking 
error standard deviation rises dramatically when the normalized noise power level 
increases. Generally, the trend of four Pareto solutions with a fxed target SINR 
condition is similar to the cases in Figure 12.4; that is, the tracking error perfor￾mance of Pareto solution 2, is the largest and Pareto solution 1 can be seen as the 312 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

moderate design criterion. For the changed target SINR condition, as shown in Fig￾ure 12.6, the tracking error performance of Pareto solution 4 also has the largest level 
between these Pareto solutions. This observation demonstrates that Pareto solution 3 
can inhibit the external disturbance effect on SINR target tracking from an average 
energy point of view with the changed target SINR condition, but its suppressing 
ability for the worst-case effect on SINR target tracking is worse than that of Pareto 
solution 1, as shown in Figure 12.5. 
For comparison, Figures 12.7 and 12.8 characterize the outage probability perfor￾mance with a fxed target SINR condition of the proposed Pareto optimal solutions, 
equal power BD, and water-flling BD at different uncertainty levels and normal￾ized noise power levels, respectively. Note that for all schemes, the outage threshold 
SINRout is set to 6 dB. As expected, the outage probability becomes large when the 
uncertainty level increases in each method. As can be seen from Figure 12.7, the 
proposed schemes all provide effcient performance gain when compared with equal 
power and water-flling BD. Since the baseline schemes do not consider imperfect 
CSI and SINR target tracking in their design procedures, their outage probability 
performs worse than the proposed methods. In Figure 12.8, for different normal￾ized noise power levels, one can see that when the normalized noise power level 
increases, the outage probability of all the schemes increases naturally. Overall, the 
outage probability performance of all the proposed methods is better than the outage 
rate of the baseline schemes (i.e., equal power and water-flling BD).

 Figures 12.9 and 12.10 compare the total transmittal power consumptions obtained 
by the proposed Pareto optimal solutions and baseline schemes with a fxed target 
SINR condition at different uncertainty levels and different normalized noise power 
levels, respectively. Since the transmittal power constraints of the baseline schemes are 
set the same, the power consumption values of the baseline schemes are equal to 30 and 
40dBm, as shown in Figures 12.9 and 12.10, respectively. As expected, the transmittal 
power of the proposed Pareto solutions is large when the uncertainty level increases 
due to the design concern of imperfect CSI as shown in Figure 12.9. Also, since Pareto 
optimal solution 4 emphasizes power-saving more than the others, the total transmittal 
power of Pareto optimal solution 4 is the smallest among the four Pareto solutions. We 
can observe that the proposed schemes can effectively save transmittal power com￾pared with equal power and water-flling BD, as shown in Figure 12.9, which indicates 
the effectiveness of the proposed methods for power saving at different uncertainty 
levels. In Figure 12.10, one can see that the proposed Pareto solutions feature more 
power saving than the baseline schemes when the normalized noise power level is 
smaller than −20 dB. Since the proposed robust SINR target tracking schemes make 
meeting the fxed target SINR level a priority and consider imperfect CSI in design 
procedure, the transmittal power of the proposed Pareto optimal solutions might be 
greater than the baseline schemes at high normalized noise power levels with a large 
number of users in the multicell MU-MIMO wireless system. However, this defciency Multi-Objective Beamforming Power Control 315

can be mitigated by changing the target SINR level at different normalized noise power 
levels. Note that in this study, how to properly assign the target SINR level is not dis￾cussed, and this topic with deep learning methods can be future work. 
For comparison between different numbers of users on SINR target tracking, Fig￾ure 12.11 shows the tracking error performance versus different numbers of users 
per cell of the four Pareto optimal solutions with the fxed and changed target SINR 
conditions, respectively. In the proposed SINR target tracking system model, the 
tracking error will be large mainly due to the variation v t() - v t( -1) of the inter- q q i i 
ference power according to (12.12) instead of the magnifcation of the interference 
power. Thus, when the number of users is large, we can observe that the proposed 
SINR target tracking methods have a more robust ability to attenuate the effect of 
interference and channel estimation error from other cells, causing a signifcant per￾formance improvement for SINR target tracking. The tendency of tracking error per￾formance in Figure 12.11 is similar to the four Pareto optimal cases in Figure 12.4. In 
Figure 12.12, we show the effect of different numbers of users on the outage proba￾bility performance between the proposed four Pareto optimal solutions, equal power 
BD, and water-flling BD. Since the equal power BD and water-flling BD do not 
have the robust ability to attenuate the effect of channel imperfection, they will suffer 
from larger interference due to the increase in the number of intercell interference

the target SINR level, even if it suffers from a large amount of channel uncertainty

have an outstanding outage probability performance when the user number increases. 
12.6 CONCLUSION 
In this chapter, we introduced a multi-objective optimal H2/H∞ SINR target track￾ing design with a minimum average power consumption scheme for a multicell 
MU-MIMO wireless beamforming system with imperfect channel information. 
A design procedure with an SINR tracking system is considered to satisfy three 
objectives without the information of statistical characteristics and the upper bound 
information of channel uncertainty. First, the original MOP is equivalently trans￾ferred into another MOP by minimizing the corresponding upper bounds and is 
fnally converted into an LMI-constrained MOP. Then a modifed MOEA is pro￾posed to effciently solve the LMI-constrained MOP for control gain and the cor￾responding beamforming matrix. Simulation examples of SINR target tracking 
with imperfect channel coeffcients are provided to illustrate the design aspect and 
to evaluate the SINR target tracking performance of the proposed multi-objective 
optimal robust H2/H∞ beamforming power control scheme with a minimum average

Thus, if the inequality (12.48) holds, then the robust H∞ tracking performance index

Investment Policy for 
a Nonlinear Stochastic 
Financial System 
13.1 INTRODUCTION 
In the felds of fnance, stocks, and social economics, because of the interaction 
between nonlinear factors, all kinds of economic problems have become more and 
more complicated today. Different types of mathematical models for fnancial sys￾tems have been widely studied. In recent years, researchers have focused on the 
system dynamic model to describe real economic and fnancial systems [132, 191, 
377, 378]. However, in practical cases, the fnancial dynamic system is a nonlin￾ear stochastic system and may suffer from continuous and discontinuous parametric 
fuctuations due to national and international situation changes, oil price changes, 
the surplus between investment and savings, variable interest rates, false economy 
policies, and so on. Thus, using a nonlinear stochastic dynamic model to describe a 
real fnancial system would be more appealing [129, 379–381]. Stochastic paramet￾ric fuctuations can be decomposed as continuous state-dependent fuctuations and 
discontinuous (jump) state-dependent fuctuations. Both of them will infuence the 
stability of the stochastic fnancial dynamic system. Moreover, external investment 
disturbance due to unpredictable investment-environmental changes or a worldwide 
event, such as war, natural disaster, fatal epidemic disease, and so on, can also affect 
the fuctuations of fnancial systems. Thus, in this chapter, a nonlinear stochastic 
jump diffusion system with internal random fuctuation and external disturbance is 
employed to describe a nonlinear stochastic fnancial system. 
Managers and investors always expect their investment policies to have not only 
higher return on investment but also lower risk. Because ROI and lower investment 
risks normally confict with each other, investment policy can be regarded as a multi￾objective optimization problem. Thus, multi-objective investment policies appear 
naturally and are also widely applied in fnancial systems [137]. For a fnancial sys￾tem, the multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy design for a nonlinear stochastic 
jump diffusion fnancial system can be seen as how to search a management policy 
to maximize ROI (H2 management policy) and minimize investment risk (H∞ man￾agement policy) simultaneously. 
Robust regulation control is to design a state feedback controller to ensure that 
the trajectories of the controlled system gradually converge to desired trajectories 326 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
(target) despite intrinsic noise and extrinsic disturbance [32, 86, 382–384]. It is par￾ticularly appropriate to employ in fnancial systems. The most two important top￾ics of robust optimal regulation control are how to minimize the regulation error to 
achieve the desired target despite intrinsic fuctuation and how to increase the system 
robustness to reject effects due to environmental disturbance. The optimal H2 man￾agement policy is proposed to minimize the regulation error to achieve the desired 
reference target despite intrinsic fuctuation [385–387]. A robust H∞ management 
policy is introduced to reduce the effects of external disturbances on the regulation 
performance. For a fnancial system, H2 optimal regulation control can be regarded 
as how to design an investment policy to ensure that the fnancial system can gradu￾ally converge to the expected trajectories of managers or investors and minimize the 
investment cost, that is, a higher ROI policy. On the other hand, robust H∞ regulation 
control for a fnancial system can be seen as how to design a manageable policy 
to minimize investment risk due to intrinsic continuous and discontinuous random 
fuctuations and external disturbance. However, both optimal H2 and robust H∞ man￾agement policy need to solve a diffcult Hamilton–Jacobi inequality (a second-order 
nonlinear partial differential equation) to achieve a desired steady state (target) of 
the nonlinear stochastic fnancial system. To overcome this diffcult problem, that is, 
solving HJI, the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model is employed to simplify the multi-ob￾jective H2/H∞ investment policy problem of nonlinear stochastic fnancial systems. 
Recently, the T–S fuzzy model has been widely used to effciently approximate 
nonlinear systems [171, 190, 382, 388], and a T–S fuzzy controller has also been 
successfully applied to stabilization control design for nonlinear systems. To avoid 
solving the annoying HJIs, the T–S fuzzy model is employed to approximate a non￾linear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial system by interpolating several local lin￾ear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial systems at different operation points. When 
a nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial system is represented by an inter￾polation of a set of linear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial systems, a T–S fuzzy 
model–based regulation method can also be developed to achieve the multi-objective 
H2/H∞ investment policy. Thus, the HJIs can be replaced by a set of linear matrix 
inequalities. These LMIs can be effciently solved by a convex optimization method 
to complete the multi-objective H2/H∞ fuzzy investment policy design. Therefore, the 
multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy problem of the nonlinear stochastic jump 
diffusion fnancial system becomes to how to solve an LMI-constrained MOP. 
Although a number of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been dis￾cussed for their ability to effciently search for the Pareto optimal solutions of MOP 
in a single run [2, 77, 206, 389, 390, 391], most of them focus on the multi-objective 
problem with algebraic functional systems or constraints. Few of these studies 
discuss the system dynamically constrained MOP for nonlinear stochastic fnancial 
systems, in which robust stability must be guaranteed beforehand. More effort is still 
needed to apply MOEAs to solve MOPs for the multi-objective H2/H∞ investment 
policy of nonlinear stochastic fnancial systems. Based on the T–S fuzzy model, the 
multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy problem of the nonlinear stochastic jump 
diffusion fnancial system can be transformed into an LMI-constrained MOP. In 
general, there exists no unique solution for the LMI-constrained MOP. The multi￾ple solutions of MOP are called Pareto optimal solutions. To effciently solve the  
 
Investment Policy for a Nonlinear Stochastic Financial System 327 
multi-objective H2/H investment policy problem of a nonlinear fnancial system, ∞ 
an indirect method is introduced to help us approach the Pareto optimal solutions 
at the Pareto front of the LMI-constrained MOP by gradually decreasing the upper 
bound of H2 and H∞ performance indices; that is, a nondominating search scheme is 
employed to fnd the Pareto front for the Pareto optimal solutions of management 
policy without violating the stability of nonlinear stochastic system simultaneously. 
The proposed LMI-constrained MOEA combines the LMI technique with MOEA 
to solve the LMI-constrained MOP for the multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy of 
nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial systems. The LMI-constrained MOEA 
search algorithm using a number of genetic operations, such as selection, mutation, 
and crossover, is proposed with the help of the LMI toolbox in MATLAB to eff￾ciently search for the Pareto front of Pareto optimal solutions and the corresponding 
fuzzy regulation gains { }i K from the LMI constraints to meet the robust stability 
and multi-objective H2/H∞ policy optimization of nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion 
fnancial systems simultaneously. As long as the Pareto front can be obtained, the 
multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy problem for a nonlinear stochastic jump dif￾fusion fnancial system can also be solved, and the manager (or investor) can select a 
mutual beneft policy according to their preference.

where a ³ 0 is the savings amount, b ³ 0 is the per-investment cost, and c ³ 0 is the 
elasticity of commercial demands. In the nonlinear fnancial model (13.1), the inter￾est rate x t( ) can be infuenced by the surplus between investment and saving as well 
as adjustments of prices. The investment demand y t( ) is proportional to the rate of 
investment and inversely proportional to the cost of investment and the interest rate. 328 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
The price index z t( ) depends on the difference between supply and demand in the 
market, and it is also infuenced by the infation rate. 
However, in practice, most fnancial systems are stochastic systems, and the 
dynamic model in (13.1) may suffer from parametric fuctuations due to the surplus 
between investment and savings, oil prices, rumors, or government policy changes. 
To mimic a real fnancial system, the dynamic model in (13.1) should be modifed 
by continuous and discontinuous intrinsic random fuctuations and environmental 
disturbance. In the following, the Wiener process (i.e., Brownian motion) and the 
marked Poisson process are introduced to model the continuous and discontinuous 
random fuctuations in a real fnancial system (see Figure 13.1). More precisely 
speaking, a fnancial market, which refers to buying and selling behavior, can be 
FIGURE 13.1 System diagram for the multi-objective investment policy problem of the 
nonlinear fnancial system. The nonlinear stochastic system in (13.3) is to be controlled to 
achieve the desired steady state xd by the multi-objective H2/H∞ regulator. In order to achieve 
the desired steady state xd, the original nonlinear stochastic fnancial system in (13.3) is shifted 
to xd so that the regulation problem to xd becomes a stabilization problem of the nonlinear 
stochastic system in (13.5). When the shifted stochastic fnancial system in (13.5) is com￾pletely approximated by the T-S fuzzy model, the multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy 
problem in (13.18) can be regarded as the LMI-constrained MOP in (13.20) by employing the 
proposed indirect method in Lemma 13.2. Since the LMI-constrained MOP in (13.20) is dif￾fcult to solve by directly calculating, we proposed the LMI-constrained MOEA to effciently 
solve the LMI-constrained MOP in (13.20). Thus, the multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy 
problem for a nonlinear stochastic fnancial system can be effciently solved by MATLAB.

described as a stochastic dynamic fnancial system. Thus, a stochastic dynamic sys￾tem can be employed to describe the price changes of objects of transaction (like 
stocks, bonds, futures, and oil) or economic index changes (investment rate, price 
index, and investment demand) [392, 393]. One of the most famous stochastic fnan￾cial systems is the stochastic stock price system [392]. 
Let (, FF , ,t P) be a fltration probability space with F = Ft W {: t ³ 0}. F is gener￾ated by the following two mutually independent stochastic processes: (1) one-dimen￾sional standard Wiener process W t( ) and (2) marked Poisson processes N t( ;qk ) for 
k = 1 2, ,...,m, and the fltration Ft
 is also generated by σ-algebra of W s( ) and σ-alge￾bra of marked Poisson processes N s( ;qk ), where k = 1 2, ,...,m for s t < . 
The nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial system with continuous and dis￾continuous random fuctuation in (13.1) can be described as follows: 
( ( )( () +s1 dx( )t = z t + y t - a) ( x t))dt ( ( xt ), yt ( ), (z t)) dW

Thus, the stochastic nonlinear autonomous controlled system for the fnancial sys￾tem in (13.2) can be written as follows (see system diagram in Figure 13.1):

disturbance and denotes the external disturbance caused by an international situation 
like war or natural disaster. Since 1-D standard Wiener process W t( ) is a continuous 
but nondifferentiable stochastic process, the term s o ( ( xt ))dW t( ) can be regarded as a 
continuous state-dependent internal random fuctuation, that is, the fnancial system 
random fuctuation dependent on the current magnitude of investment rate, price 
index, and investment demand. The term Q = {, ,...,q } Ì 1 qq ˙ is the mark space of 1 2 m 
Poisson random processes and denotes the set of all possible fnancial emergencies, 
which will cause discontinuous changes of the system in (13.3); the mark qk denotes 
a fnancial emergency in the fnancial system such as fnancial tsunami, company 
merger, hot money infow, or collapse of a bank; and the term G o xt qk ( ( ), ) denotes a
sudden violent change (magnitude jump) of investment rate, price index, or invest￾ment demand of the stochastic fnancial system in (13.3) when a fnancial emergency 
å m 
1 happens. Thus, the summation term G ( ( xt ),q )( dN t; ) q denotes all the possi- o k k k= 
ble nonlinear stochastic discontinuous changes of the system in (13.3) at the time 
instant t, whose jump amplitudes depend on the corresponding jump coeffcient func￾tion G o xt qk ( ( ), ). It is necessary to note that in this chapter, we assume all emergen￾cies are mutually exclusive events (i.e., when the jump occurs at time instant t, there 
is only one mark qk to be assigned). In this chapter, we use a 3-D nonlinear fnancial 
system (13.1) to illustrate the fnancial multi-objective design. However, the fnancial 
stochastic system in (13.2) or (13.3) can be extended to any n-dimensional nonlin-
( ( ), x t T n ear stochastic fnancial system. In this situation, x t() = xt x t( ),..., ( )) Î ˙ . 1 2 n n n n n n n ´ In this case, we have f : ˙ ® ˙ , s : ˙ ® ˙ , G : ˙ ´ ® ˙ , and B n p Q : ˙ o o o o 2 + p when ut Î LF () (˙ ˙, ).
Some important properties of the Poisson jump process are given as follows [379]: 
(1) E d{ ( N t; ) q } = l dt where the fnite scalar number l > 0 is the Poisson jump k k k 
intensity for mark qk . 
(2) E dN t( ;qk {[ )] dt } = 0 for all k .
(3) E dN t( ;qk {[ )] dW } = 0 for all k .
(4) E d {[ N t( ;q )][ dN t ( ;q )]} = 0 for all k ¹ k . k k 1 2 1 2 
(5) E d {[ N t(; q )][ dN( ;t q )]} = l dt for all k = k . k k k 1 2 1 2 1 
In fact, managers or investors always expect that the dynamic behaviors of the 
invested fnancial system satisfy their expectations. Thus, multi-objective optimal 
control theories are particularly suited for multi-objective investment policy prob￾lems of fnancial systems. 
å
From the system diagram in Figure 13.1, the regulation purpose of the sto￾chastic fnancial system in (13.3) is to design regulation effort u t() so that (1) the 
intrinsic random continuous and discontinuous fuctuations s o ( ( xt ))dW t( ) and m 
1 
G ( ( xt ),q ) ( dN t ; ) q can be tolerated by the stochastic fnancial system; (2) the o k k k= 
effect of external disturbance v t( ) on the regulation performance of the fnancial sys￾tem should be as small as possible, that is, with less risk; and (3) the desired target xd 
can fnally be achieved with a low cost. 
In order to regulate x t( ) to the desired steady state (target) xd, for the convenience 
of control design, the origin of the nonlinear stochastic fnancial system in (13.3)  
)
Investment Policy for a Nonlinear Stochastic Financial System 331 
should be shifted to xd at frst. In such a situation, if the shifted nonlinear stochastic 
fnancial system is robustly stabilized at the origin, then the robust regulation of x t() 
to the desired state(target) xd will be equivalently achieved. This will simplify the 
regulation control design procedure of the stochastic nonlinear fnancial system. Let 
us denote 
x t () = x t() - xd (13.4) 
Then, we get the following shifted nonlinear stochastic fnancial system in (13.3): 
dx t () = (( f xt ( )) + Bu( ) t + v(t d )) t +s ( ( x t d )) W 
(13.5)
+ m G(x t qk dN t qk å ( ),) ( ; ) k=1 
where f x( ( t)) = f ( ( x t  ) + x ), s ( ( xt  )) = s ( ( x t  ) + x ), G ( ( x t  ), q ) = G ( xt  () + x , ) q . o d o d k o d k 
Thus, the origin xt () = 0 of the nonlinear stochastic fnancial system in (13.5) is at
the desired steady state (target) xd of the original nonlinear stochastic fnancial sys￾tem in (13.3); that is, the investment policy problem of regulating nonlinear stochas￾tic fnancial system in (13.3) to the desired xd is transformed into the stabilization 
problem of the shifted nonlinear stochastic fnancial system in (13.5). 
In order to achieve the desired state xd with less regulation effort u t( ) in spite 
of continuous and discontinuous random fuctuation, the H2 control performance 
J u t 2 (( )) index for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion system in (13.5) without 
consideration of J u t 2 (( )) is defned as follows:

considered the worst-case investment risk from external disturbance. Since the exter￾nal disturbance is unpredictable, the worst-case effect of external disturbance is con￾sidered in the investment risk.

In this chapter, from the system diagram of the nonlinear stochastic fnancial sys￾tem in Figure 13.1, we want to design a multi-objective H2/H∞ robust investment 
policy for system state x t() to achieve a desired state xd from the perspective of 
minimum H2 regulation error with minimum investment effort u t( ) in (13.6) and 
minimum H∞ investment risk in (13.7) under intrinsic fuctuations and external dis￾turbance. A more detailed design procedure of the multi-objective H2/H robust ∞

FOR NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC FINANCIAL JUMP 
SYSTEMS VIA FUZZY INTERPOLATION METHOD 
In general, construction of the multi-objective H2/H∞ regulation control for a nonlin￾ear stochastic system needs to solve an HJI-constrained MOP, which is diffcult to 
solve analytically or numerically. To overcome this diffcult problem, the T–S fuzzy 
interpolation method is employed here to approximate the nonlinear stochastic jump 
diffusion fnancial system in (13.5). The T–S fuzzy dynamic model is proposed to 
approximate the nonlinear stochastic system in (13.5) by interpolating several local 
linearized stochastic jump diffusion fnancial systems around some operation points 
[171, 190, 382, 388, 394–396]. The T–S fuzzifed model is described by a group of 
if–then rules and is used to simplify the multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy
design problem of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial system. The ith

rule of the T–S fuzzy model for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial 
system in (13.5) is described by

The overall fuzzy system in (13.10) can be inferred as follows [190]:

The physical meaning of the fuzzy model in (13.11) is that the following l locally

Similarly, the multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy ut () = K x((  t)) for the non￾linear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial system could be approximated by the fol￾lowing fuzzy investment policy: 
Investment Policy i : 
For i = 1 2, ,...,l 
(13.15) if z 1 is G i1 and a ... nd z g is Gig 
then ut () = K x( )t ,for i = , ,..., i

The overall multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy u t( ) for the nonlinear sto￾chastic jump diffusion fnancial system can be represented by 
l 
u t() = åh z() K x() t (13.16) i i 
i=1 
where h z( ) is designed as (13.11), and K is the regulation gain for the ith fuzzy i i 
linearized system for i = 1 2, ,...,l. 
The fuzzy parameters Ai
, Ci
, and Ei qk () of l local linear fnancial systems in
(13.11) can be easily identifed by the system identifcation toolbox in MATLAB. If 
an adequate number of fuzzy rules is used in the T–S fuzzy system in (13.11), then 
the fuzzy approximation error could be considered one kind of parametric fuctua￾tion, and the proposed robust H2/H∞ multi-objective investment policy can effciently 
override these parametric fuctuations due to fuzzy approximation. Therefore, the 
multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy problem can be regarded as how to design 
fuzzy investment policy u t( ) in (13.16) so that the T–S stochastic fnancial system in 
(13.11) can achieve the multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy in (13.6) and (13.7). 
Higher-beneft investment behavior always comes with higher risk and capital 
cost. The optimal H2 regulation in (13.6) expects the energy of regulation error xt ( )
and admissible investment policy u t( ) to be as low as possible, that is, use minimum 
capital to earn a desired beneft. However, for robust H∞ regulation design, a better 
(lower) H∞ performance index is always coupled with a higher capital cost to reject 
intrinsic continuous and discontinuous fuctuation as well as external disturbance to 
achieve the desired target xd with less risk. It is clear that the optimal H2 and robust 
H∞ regulation design are mutually conficting. Thus, designing a controller (invest￾ment policy) to optimize the H2 performance index J u( (t)) and the H∞ performance 2 
index J u(( t)) is indeed an MOP of fnancial regulation systems. The defnition of ¥ 
the multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffu￾sion fnancial system is given in the following. 
Defnition 13.1: The multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy of a given nonlinear 
stochastic Poisson jump diffusion fnancial system in (13.11) is to design an admis￾sible investment policy u t( ) in (16), which can make the H2 and H∞ performance 
indices minimum in the Pareto optimal sense simultaneously, that is 
min ( J u(t) ,) J u t ))s.t. (13.11) (13.17) 2 ( ¥ ( () u t( )ÎU Investment Policy for a Nonlinear Stochastic Financial System 335 
where U is the set of all the admissible investment policies for the given nonlin￾ear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial system; the objective functions J u t 2 ( ( )) and 
J u(( t)) are defned in (13.6) and (13.7), respectively; the vector of the objective ¥ 
functions ( ( 2 ( )), ¥ J u t J ( ( u t)))is the objective vector of ut ( ).
Lemma 13.2 ([15]): Suppose a and b are the upper bounds of the H2 and H∞ 
performance indices, respectively, that is, J u( (t )) £ a and J u( (t)) £ b . The MOP 2 ¥ 
in (13.17) is equivalent to the MOP given in the following: 
min(a b,) s.t. J u( (t )) £ a and J (( ut )) £ b (13.18) u t( )ÎU 2 ¥ 
Proof: The proof of this lemma is straightforward. One only needs to prove that 
both inequalities contained in the multi-objective problem in (13.18) become equal 
for Pareto optimal solutions. We will show this by contradiction. Given a 3-tuple * * * Pareto optimal solution (( ut ),a b, )of the MOP in (13.18), we assume that either
of the inequalities in (13.18) remains a strict inequality at the Pareto optimal solution. 
Without loss of generality, suppose that J u( (t)) < a* 
2 . As the result, there exists a1 
such that a < a* ( ( )) = a . Now, for the same ut a b* and J u t ( ), the solution ( , ) dom- 1 2 1 
inates the Pareto optimal solution ( , * * a b ) , leading to a contradiction. This implies 
that both inequality constraints in MOP (13.18) indeed become equality for Pareto 
optimal solutions. The optimization problem in (13.18) is, hence, equivalent to the 
MOP described in (13.17). 
In this study, Lemma 2 provides an indirect method to solve the multi-objective 
H2/H∞ investment policy problem of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial 
system. 
Lemma 13.3 ([90]): For any two real matrices A, B with appropriate dimensions, 
we have 
T T 2 T 1 T AB + B A £ g A A + BB

where g is any nonzero real number.

Then the following theorems will provide suffcient conditions for the fuzzy 
investment policy u t( ) in (13.16) to solve the multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy 
problem for the nonlinear stochastic jump fnancial system in (13.5). In the follow￾ing, according to two kinds of Poisson noise in stochastic fnancial systems, marked

13.4 MULTI-OBJECTIVE H2/H∞ INVESTMENT POLICY 
OF NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC FINANCIAL SYSTEM 
DESIGN VIA LMI-CONSTRAINED MOEA 
The MOEA is a stochastic search method simulating natural selection in natural 
evolution. It is also particularly suitable for solving the multi-objective investment 
optimization problem of nonlinear stochastic fnancial systems due to its popula￾tion-based nature, permitting a set of Pareto optimal solutions to be obtained in a 
single run. For a multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy problem of a nonlinear sto￾chastic jump diffusion fnancial system, the MOPs in Theorems 13.1 and 13.3 with 
LMI constraints to guarantee the robust stability of the nonlinear stochastic fnancial 
system in (13.5) or (13.11) under continuous and discontinuous parametric fuctua￾tions and external disturbance. It is not easy to solve the MOP in Theorem 13.1 or 
13.3 directly. In this section, an LMI-constrained MOEA search algorithm is devel￾oped to help us solve the MOP in Theorem 13.1 or 13.3 iteratively. Before further 
discussion, some important defnitions of Pareto optimality of an LMI-constrained 
MOP for nonlinear stochastic fnancial systems are given as follows: 
Defnition 13.3 ([77, 205]): Consider the LMI-constrained MOP in (13.19). 
A feasible objective vector ( , 1 1 ab ) is said to dominate another feasible 2 2 1 2 1 2 objective vector ( , ab ) if and only if a £ a and b £ b for at least one 
inequality as a strict inequality.  
Investment Policy for a Nonlinear Stochastic Financial System 345 
1 1 1 2 2 2 Defnition 13.4 ([77, 205]): Let (, P K ,..., K )and ( , P K ,..., K ) be the fea- 1 l 1 l 
1 1 2 2 sible solution corresponding to the objective value ( , a b ) and ( , a b ) 
subject to the LMIs in (13.20)–(13.22) for all i j , = 1,...,l, respectively. 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 ( , P K ,..., K ) P K ,..., K ) if a £ a2
 and b £ 2
1 l is said to dominate (, 1 l b
for at least one inequality as a strict inequality. * * * Defnition 13.5 ([77, 205]): A solution ( , P K1 ,..., Kl ) with objective value 
( , * * a b )is said to be a Pareto optimal solution of (13.19) if there does not 
exist another feasible solution ( , P K1,..., Kl) with objective value ( , a b ), 
such that (, a b )dominates ( , a b ). * * 
Defnition 13.6 ([77, 205]): For the LMI-constrained MOP of the nonlinear 
stochastic fnancial system in (13.19), the Pareto front PF is defned as 
* * * * * * * PF = {( , a b )( P , , K ..., K ) a b ) is 1 l is a Pareto optimal solution and (, * * * generated by ( , P K1 ,..., Kl ) subject to the LMIs in (13.20), (13.21), and 
(13.22) for i j , = 1,...,l} 
The LMI-constrained MOP for the nonlinear stochastic fnancial system concerns an 
evolution algorithm. For the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA, the EA operates on 
a number of encoding feasible objective vectors called a population so that, for a fea- k sible objective vector ( , a bk
), it should be encoded into a chromosome Ck . A feasi￾ble chromosome Ck is defned as a coded feasible objective vector. The chromosome 
of the EA for the LMI-constrained MOEA employs the real-value representation to 
avoid long binary strings and a large search space in the EA for the multi-objective 
H2/H∞ investment policy of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial system. 
In general, EA takes a population to be the algorithm input and returns the chro￾mosomes with ft performance to be the next population. The LMI constraints in 
(13.20)–(13.22) to guarantee the robust stability of the fnancial system and the two 
upper bounds a and b are just like the environments in natural evolution. Only the 
adaptive chromosomes survive. To guarantee that all of these chromosomes can be 
decoded as feasible objective vectors for the MOP in (13.19), each chromosome Ck k k k should be examined for the existence of a feasible solution ( , P K1 ,..., Kl ) in LMIs 
in (13.20)–(13.22) with the LMI toolbox in MATLAB after the mating operation. 
If some chromosomes are not feasible, these chromosomes need to be removed 
from the candidate chromosomes. It is worth mentioning that the LMI constraints 
in (13.20)–(13.22) impose more restrictions on searching the feasible chromosomes 
than the conventional MOEA approach. Besides, using the LMI toolbox in MAT￾LAB can help effciently examine whether these chromosomes satisfy the LMIs in 
(13.20)–(13.22), which accelerates the selection speed of the initial populations via 
the initialization scheme. 
Design procedure of multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy of nonlinear 
stochastic financial systems:
Step 1: Select the search range S = ( , a b ) ( ´ a b, ) for the feasible objective 0 0 
vector ( , a b ) and set the iteration number N, the population number Np, the 
crossover ration Nc, and the mutation ratio Nm in the LMI-constrained MOEA.  
346 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
Step 2: Select Np feasible chromosomes from the feasible chromosome set 
randomly to be the initial population P1. 
Step 3: Set iteration index Ni = 1. 
Step 4: Operate the EA with the crossover ratio Nc and mutation ratio Nm 
and generate 2Np feasible chromosomes by examining whether their cor￾responding objective vectors are feasible objective vectors for the LMIs in 
(13.20)–(13.22). 
Step 5: Set the iteration index N = N +1 and select N chromosomes from i i p 
the 2Np feasible chromosomes in Step 4 through the nondominated sorting 
method as the population PN . 
i 
Step 6: Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until iteration number N is reached. If iteration 
number N is satisfed, then we set PN = PF . i 
† † Step 7: Select a preferable feasible objective individual ( , ab ) Î PF accord￾ing to the designer’s preference. Once the preferable feasible objective indi￾vidual is selected, the corresponding Pareto optimal solution

13.5 SIMULATION RESULTS 
To illustrate the design procedure and to confrm the performance of the proposed 
optimal investment policy for the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial sys￾tem, we introduce a nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial system to mimic 
an emerging market in (13.2). In general, an emerging market always suffers from 
continuous and discontinuous intrinsic random fuctuations due to national and inter￾national situation changes, oil price changes, surplus between investments and sav￾ings, variable interest rates, and so on. External investment disturbance is caused by 
unpredictable investment changes or worldwide events such as war, nature disaster, 
fatal epidemic, and so on. Investment Policy for a Nonlinear Stochastic Financial System 347

z t( ) of the nonlinear stochastic fnancial system fuctuate with random jumps. There￾fore, the multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy of the MOP in (13.17) is employed 
by the government to design an investment policy to regulate the stochastic fnancial 
system to achieve the following desired steady state: 
xd = ( . 0145 ,. ,. -02 ) (13.53) 
that is, the government of the emerging market expects its fnancial system to be 
regulated to achieve a desired fnancial steady state with interest rate 0.1, investment 
demand 4.5, and price index −0.2 to coordinate infation rate, supply, and demand in 
the emerging market to stimulate the recovery of emerging market under continuous 
and discontinuous random fuctuation. 
In this example, we assume the vector of premise variables 
z = [ ( x t x ), t T = [z t z t T ( )] ( ), ( )] in (13.11) and (13.16) is available in the regulation 1 2 1 2

weighting matrices:

Based on the proposed design procedure of the multi-objective H2/H∞ optimal 
investment policy, the MOEA is employed to solve the MOP in (19). In the MOEA, 
the search region G is set as G = [0 70]´[ . 0 41 . ] 2 , the maximum number of indi￾viduals Np = 80, iteration number Ni = 100, crossover rate Nc = 0 8. , and mutation 
ratio Nm = 0 2. . 
Once the iteration number N = 100 is achieved, the Pareto front PF for the Pareto 
optimal solutions of the MOP for the investment policy of the nonlinear stochastic 
jump diffusion fnancial system of the emerging market in (5) or (11) can be obtained 
as shown in Figure 13.4. 
In order to illustrate how to select the preferable solution of the investment pol￾icy, we choose three Pareto optimal solutions from the Pareto front for comparison, 
whose Pareto objective vectors are given in Table 13.1. Moreover, in Figures 13.5– 
13.7, the simulation results of the nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial 
system for the emerging market are given to illustrate the performance of the

Pareto solutions are also given in Table 13.2. In Figures 13.5–13.7, Pareto optimal 
solution 1 has the best J∞ performance index of the three chosen Pareto optimal 
solutions so that the trajectory of Pareto optimal solution 1 has the minimum per￾turbation but has the maximum J2 performance index. However, Pareto optimal 
solution 3 has the minimum J2 performance index, but its trajectory has the maxi￾mum perturbation of the three because it has the maximum J2 performance index. 
It is easy to observe that Pareto solution 2 is the preferable regulation solution of 
the three chosen Pareto solutions because Pareto solution 2 is a compromise solu￾tion for J2 and J∞ in the multi-objective investment policy problem of the nonlinear 
stochastic jump diffusion fnancial system. However, these three Pareto optimal 
solutions have satisfactory regulation results to achieve the desired steady states 
of the fnancial system in spite of intrinsic continuous and discontinuous random 
fuctuation and external disturbance, respectively.

system dynamic-constrained MOP, the T–S fuzzy model interpolation method is 
employed such that the nonlinear system dynamic constraints can be replaced by two 
sets of LMI constraints. If there exist feasible solutions for the LMI constraints in 
(13.20)–(13.22), the LMI-constrained MOP can be solved more easily by the pro￾posed LMI-constrained MOEA. Thus, the multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy 
for nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial systems can be solved effciently with 
the help of MATLAB via the LMI toolbox. When the Pareto front is obtained for the 
Pareto optimal solutions of the MOP in (13.19), the manager can select a fuzzy invest￾ment policy from the set of Pareto optimal fuzzy investment policies according to their 
preference and fnish the multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy design of the non￾linear stochastic fnancial system. Finally, an example is given to confrm the satisfac￾tory performance of the proposed multi-objective H2/H∞ investment policy design for 
nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion fnancial systems through computer simulation.

Smart Grid Network 
14.1 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, power demand is increasing along with the deployment of tech￾nology and industry, and there have arisen a lot of challenges for traditional power 
systems, such as the integration of renewable energy sources (RESs), energy eff￾ciency, and the reliability of power systems. In this situation, issues of smart grids 
have attracted much attention. Smart grid networks have changed the conventional 
operation of power systems from power generation, transmission, and distribution in 
the last several years by integrating advanced control technology, sensing technol￾ogy, and the topology of communication. The main characteristics of a smart grid are 
consumer friendliness, self-healing, support of multiple types of generation, storage 
options, effcient electricity market-based operation, and high power quality [398]. 
In a smart grid network, energy management methods play an important role and 
can help solve many problems of energy management with various methods, such as 
power fow management [399, 400] and demand side management [325, 401–404]. 
Smart pricing, which is an energy management method, has been intensively investi￾gated [325, 401–404], because it can effectively control the balance between power 
supply and demand based on the electricity market mechanism. It is worth pointing 
out that although RESs can provide extra clean energy in a grid network, the gener￾ation of energy from RESs is usually unpredictable and intermittent given weather 
conditions. This will infuence the reliability of the power system or the quality of 
the power supply, and it could even lead to blackouts in the case of an event in 
which the power supply cannot meet the demand. Therefore, integration of RESs is 
also an important issue for smart pricing in smart grid networks. A practical pricing 
scheme [401] is proposed to encourage different consumers to participate in smart 
grid demand response with a nonlinear programming problem that aims at minimiz￾ing the overall operation cost. A robust dynamic pricing scheme [402] is proposed 
to minimize the imbalance between power supply and demand in a smart grid net￾work under a worst-case disturbance due to the uncertainty of RESs. An advanced 
metering infrastructure (AMI) is the deployment of interconnected smart meters 356 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
that enable two-way communication to exchange information among the agents in 
a power system, and the interactions of agents in the grid are not like the traditional 
ones [405]. With a smart meter in a smart grid, the users of microgrids access their 
real-time information such as the price policy of the grid. Moreover, smart meters 
have a certain amount of computation capability. Users can actively participate in the 
operation of the power market. Thus, the consideration of these interactions in the 
smart grid is important. There have been several studies to discuss these interactions 
in smart grid networks [406, 407]. 
In general, a manager of a grid network expects to design a pricing policy to bal￾ance the stored energy of the microgrid at a desired level for operation in emergen￾cies and also that the smart grid network can have robust energy management against 
external disturbances from RESs. For the energy management systems in smart grid 
networks, the H2 pricing policy management scheme can be regarded as how to 
design a pricing policy to ensure that the stored energy of the microgrids could be 
driven to a desired reference level with a minimum mean square price perturbation. 
In general, H2 pricing policy ignores the effect of external disturbance on the desired 
reference-level tracking of the management policy of the smart grid network. On 
the other hand, a robust H∞ pricing policy in a smart grid network could be seen as a 
management scheme to design a dynamic pricing policy to minimize the worst-case 
effect of intermittent and unpredictable power input from RESs on the tracking per￾formance of the desired energy storage reference level. The H∞ pricing management 
policy can effectively attenuate the worst-case effect of external disturbance from 
RESs on the reference tracking performance of energy management, but it usually 
leads to a higher price perturbation, which is not wanted by the market operator. 
Because there is a partial confict between the objectives of the H2 and H∞ pric￾ing management policies, the pricing management policy to simultaneously achieve 
multi-objective H2/H∞ pricing management policy can be regarded as an MOP. 
To start up or shut down the current load, the users of a smart grid may pay extra 
when they adjust their power demands according to the price signal. The average 
of the power demand can provide valuable information for the price forecast of the 
users in the smart grid network. Thus, the collective (average) demand behaviors 
will also infuence the users’ power demand behaviors in these situations. Mean feld 
theory has attracted a considerable attention and has studied collective behaviors 
resulting from mutual interaction in various research areas [408–411]. In general, 
in the mean feld game, there exist the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) 
equation and Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov (FPK) equation to represent the opti￾mal response of players and the dynamic evolution of the population distribution, 
respectively [410]. Mean feld theory has also been applied in the feld of smart grids 
[412–415]. In [414], agents in the smart grid can submit their graphs of supply and 
demand to bid according to the price signal and the average effect calculated by sta￾tistical information. 
In previous work on mean feld smart grid network systems [412–415], they do 
not consider the integration of RESs in the smart grid. The integration of RESs is an 
important issue for a smart grid network. On the other hand, in the real world, the 
power market system may also suffer from continuous or discontinuous paramet￾ric fuctuations due to changes in natural or economic situations [416, 417]. In this  
 
Multi-Objective Optimal H 357 2/H∞ Dynamic Pricing Management 
situation, the smart grid network system should be modeled as a stochastic jump 
diffusion system with the consideration of RESs as an uncertain external disturbance. 
We propose a dynamic stochastic mean feld smart grid network system to describe 
the interacting and collective behavior of microgrids equipped with energy storage 
devices and RESs. Moreover, when each microgrid changes its own demand behav￾ior, it interacts with the others through the dynamic price policy to infuence the 
overall demand. Thus, by using the mean feld theory, the total infuence of microgrid 
actions can be considered collective behaviors (mean feld term) of microgrids in the 
smart grid network. 
In this chapter, a multi-objective H2/H∞ dynamic pricing scheme is proposed to 
design a pricing strategy to manage the energy in a mean feld stochastic smart grid 
network, with an optimal H2 tracking strategy to achieve the desired stored energy 
working levels of microgrids with parsimonious management effort and the optimal 
H∞ tracking strategy to attenuate the worst-case effect of external disturbance due to 
unpredictable and intermittent RESs. Since the initial producer and consumer’s mar￾ginal beneft is constant and cannot be easily attenuated by the conventional H∞ state 
feedback tracking control method, an integration-based state feedback control scheme 
is proposed to eliminate constant disturbances due to the constant initial producer 
marginal cost and initial consumer marginal beneft to achieve asymptotic tracking of 
the desired stored energy working level of the microgrids. However, it is still diffcult 
to directly solve the multi-objective H2/H∞ dynamic pricing management problem for 
the desired reference tracking control of microgrids in the mean feld stochastic smart 
grid network system. An indirect method is proposed to solve the design problem of 
the multi-objective H2/H∞ pricing management policy for the mean feld stochastic 
smart grid network by simultaneously minimizing the upper bounds of the H2 and H∞ 
dynamic pricing management performance to achieve Pareto multi-objective optimal￾ity. By the indirect method, the multi-objective H2/H∞ dynamic pricing management 
problem can be transformed into a linear matrix inequality–constrained MOP from 
which we can fnd a set of control gains for integration-based state feedback control to 
minimize the upper bound of the H2 and H∞ pricing management policy performance 
subject to a set of LMI constraints in the Pareto multi-objective optimal sense. These 
LMIs can be effciently solved by the LMI toolbox in MATLAB. 
Furthermore, we propose an LMI-constrained multi-objective evolutionary algo￾rithm to effciently solve the LMI-constrained MOP for the multi-objective H2/H∞ 
dynamic pricing management scheme for the mean feld stochastic smart grid net￾work system. The LMI-constrained MOEA search via a number of genetic opera￾tions includes selection, mutation, and crossover to effciently search the Pareto front 
of the Pareto optimal solutions and its corresponding control strategy to achieve the 
H2 and H∞ dynamic pricing management policy with the help of the LMI toolbox in 
MATLAB for the mean feld stochastic smart grid network system simultaneously. 
The objectives of this chapter are summarized as follows: 
• A dynamic stochastic mean feld smart grid network system, in which each 
microgrid is infuenced by the collective demand behaviors and unpredict￾able and intermittent RESs, is introduced with continuous and discontinu￾ous random fuctuation to mimic a realistic networked power system.  
 
358 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
• Since the initial producer and consumer marginal beneft are constant and 
cannot be easily attenuated by the conventional state feedback tracking 
control method, an integration-based state feedback control strategy is pro￾posed to eliminate constant disturbances due to constant initial producer 
marginal cost and initial consumer marginal beneft in the mean feld sto￾chastic smart grid network system. 
• To achieve the desired energy storage level of each microgrid, a multi￾objective H2/H∞ dynamic pricing management policy is proposed based on 
the state and integrative state feedback control for the smart grid network to 
achieve the optimal desired reference storage tracking with a parsimonious 
price policy and optimal attenuation of external disturbance mainly due to 
unpredictable and intermittent RESs and constant initial producer marginal 
cost and initial consumer marginal beneft. 
• An indirect method is introduced to transform the multi-objective H2/H∞ 
dynamic pricing management problem of the stochastic mean feld smart 
grid network system into an LMI-constrained MOP, and an LMI-constrained 
MOEA is also proposed to effciently solve the LMI-constrained MOP with 
the help of the MATLAB toolbox. 
This chapter is divided into six sections as follows: in Section 14.2, the mean feld 
stochastic smart grid network system is introduced, and the MO H2/H∞ dynamic pric￾ing management problem is formulated. In Section 14.3, using the proposed indirect 
method, the MO H2/H∞ state feedback controller design problem is transformed into 
an equivalent LMI-constrained MOP. In Section 14.4, an LMI-constrained MOEA is 
developed to effciently solve the LMI-constrained MOP. A design example with the 
simulation results is given in Section 14.5. The chapter is concluded in Section 14.6.

We consider the following smart grid network model consisting of a power grid and 
N microgrids [5]:

where p t d

g

d > d pricing policy; b 0 is the initial marginal beneft of the nth microgrid; c > 0 is the n b n q demand elasticity of the nth microgrid; > N 0 is the initial marginal cost of the dis￾tributed power; cg > 0 is the demand elasticity of the distributed power; t g and t n
d are 
time constants; s t( ) denotes the stored energy state of the nth microgrid; and t s t( ) n kn g with t > 0 is considered the additional cost for the excess power supply p t( ). k n 
In the model in (14.1), the nth microgrid would adjust one’s own power demand d p t( ) according to the pricing policy u t( ). When the marginal beneft of the nth micro- n d d d grid b + c p t( ) exceeds the pricing policy u t( ), the user of the nth microgrid would n n n 
increase their power demand rate, and vice versa. The power grid adjusts the distributed g power of the nth microgrid p t( ) in the way that increases/decreases the distributed n 
power rate of the nth microgrid, when the pricing policy N 
1 u t( ) exceeds/less than the 
g g sum of the distributed power marginal cost function b 
+ c p ( )t and the additional N gn 
cost t k n s t( ) of the excess power supply of the nth microgrid to ensure the stability of 
the smart grid network system. For storage energy s t( ) in the nth microgrid, each n 
microgrid is equipped with a stored energy device and local energy harvesting device g so that each microgrid can receive power from distributed power p t( ) and the RES n 
r t( ) from the local energy harvesting device. Since the solar panels or wind turbine n 
are infuenced by weather disturbance, the RES r t( ) is always unpredictable and n 
intermittent, so it can be regarded as an external disturbance for each microgrid in 
the smart grid system [403]. 
In the real world, a power market system always suffers from random parametric 
fuctuations due to the behaviors of consumers and sudden political or economic 
events in the market. The power demand behavior of each microgrid will impact the 
pricing policy, and users of the microgrid will adjust their power demands accord￾ing to the pricing policy. However, the users of a smart grid may pay high costs for 
the startup or shutdown of the current load when they adjust their power demand 
according to the pricing policy. We assume that the average of the power demands 
of all microgrids can provide valuable information on the trend of collective power 
demand and the price forecast for the users of the smart grid. Thus, the user of each 
microgrid will also consider the mean behavior of power demands of microgrids to 
adjust their own power demand. The dynamic of the power demand of the nth micro￾grid can be reformulated as follows

To mimic a real power market system, the power market dynamic model should be 
modifed by continuous and discontinuous intrinsic random fuctuations [416, 417]. 
In (14.2), the term ( s p t( ) + Ep td ( ) d sm d
( )) W t can be deemed a continuous state-de- n n n n n 
pendent intrinsic random fuctuation to describe the users of the microgrid changing 
their demand behavior because of random factors like rumors in the power market d rm d and weather changes; the Poisson random processes (r pt ( ) + Ep ( td )) N t( ) are n n n n n 
discontinuous sudden random fuctuations such as policy changes or instantaneous 
loads when the users of the smart grid use high-power appliances. 
In order to maintain normal operation of the microgrid in an emergency, the energy 
storage system of the microgrid must be maintained at a working level; that is, the 
market operator needs to have the energy storage state track a desired working level. 
Suppose a desired energy storage state of the nth microgrid can be generated by the 
following reference model 
d d ds ( )t = (a s t( ) + b t( )) dt,n = 1 2, ,..., N (14.3) n n n n 
d where s t() is the desired energy state to be tracked by s t( ), a is a specifed con- n n n d stant to model the transient behavior of s t( ), and b t( ) is a bounded reference input. n n d If we specify a = -1 at the steady state s t() = b t( ), b t( ) denotes the desired steady n n n n 
working state of energy storage in the nth microgrid. 
The error state dynamic of the energy storage of microgrid n can be expressed as 
g d d de t() = ( ( p t) - p t( ) - a s t( ) + r t( ) - b t( ))dt (14.4) n n n n n n n 
for i = 1 2, ,..., N 
d where the error state e t() = s t() - s t( ). n n n 
g The distributed power p t( ) from the power grid to each microgrid can be refor- n 
mulated as follows 
g 1 g g () ( ) ( b 
t dp t = ( u t - + c pt ( )) -t e t( )) dt (14.5) g n N N gn kn 
for i = 1 2, ,..., N 
Thus, the dynamic system of the overall mean feld stochastic smart grid network 
in (14.2), (14.3), (14.4), and (14.5) can be expressed in the following:

Remark 14.1: Some important properties of the Wiener process and Poisson jump 
process are given as follows: 
(1) EW t = E dW t i { (i )} { ( )} = 0 ,for i = 1, 2,..., N.
(2) E d{ N t( )} dt = 0,for i = 1,2,..., N. i 
(3) E d{ N t i( )} = li

Since the term Ex( )t appears in (14.6), robust tracking control design problems for 
mean feld stochastic smart grid systems are more diffcult than the classical tracking 
control design problem of stochastic smart grid systems. To overcome this diffcult 
problem, a decouple method is proposed to solve the robust tracking control problem 
of the mean feld stochastic smart grid system by separating the smart grid network 
system into two orthogonal subsystems, a mean subsystem and a variation subsystem. 
By applying the expectation operator to (14.6), we have the mean subsystem as 
follows 
˙ N 
dExt = [(A + () ål q Dq Ex t + ( ) + E ( ) + b d ˙ ) ( ) BEx t vt ] t (14.7) q=1 
m ˆ m whereAˆ = (A + A ), D = (D + D ) , Eu() t ˆ E{( ut )}, and Ev() t ˆ E{ ( vt )}. q q q 
Subtracting the system in (14.6) from the mean subsystem in (14.7), the variation 
subsystem x t ˇ() = x t() - Ex( )t can be obtained as follows 
N ˙ dxˇ() t = [(Ax t ˇ() -ål q DE q xt () + Buˇ() t + ˇ v( )td ] t q=1

deˇ() t = Mx t ˇ() (14.9) 
m where Cˆ = C + C , u t ˇ() = u t() - Eu( )t and v t ˇ() = v t() - Ev( )t . r r r 
The effect of constant vector b due to the initial marginal cost and beneft on the 
power grid and microgrids is still in (14.7), and it cannot be easily attenuated asymp￾totically by conventional state feedback control alone. Thus, an additional integration 
state feedback control of (14.7) is necessary to achieve asymptotic tracking. Let z t() 
denote the integration of Ee() t
dz() t = Ee t() dt = ME x t( )dt (14.10) 
For convenience of design, the following augmented mean subsystem is introduced 
as follows

Even if the H2 optimal quadratic tracking design could achieve the optimal refer￾ence tracking of desired stored energy state, it could not treat the external disturbance

Multi-Objective Optimal H 365 2/H∞ Dynamic Pricing Management 
The multi-objective H2/H∞ dynamic pricing management problem can be regarded 
as how to design the pricing policy v( )t in (14.13) so that the mean feld stochastic 
smart grid system in (14.6) can achieve the multi-objective H2/H dynamic pric- ∞ 
ing optimization performance in (14.14) and (14.15) simultaneously. The optimal 
H2 pricing policy in (14.14) expects the imbalanced energy in each microgrid and 
admissible pricing policy u t( ) as lower as possible. However, for robust H∞ pricing 
management design, the H∞ pricing policy is always coupled with a higher price u t() 
to reject external disturbance from RESs and constant b to achieve the desired energy 
storage s t( ) of the working level for each microgrid. It is clear that the optimal d

Defnition 14.1: The multi-objective H2/H dynamic pricing management ∞ 
for the augmented mean feld stochastic smart grid system in (14.12) is to

are defned in (14.14) and (14.15), respectively. The vector of the objective functions

14.3 MULTI-OBJECTIVE H2/H∞ DYNAMIC PRICING POLICY DESIGN 
FOR MEAN FIELD STOCHASTIC SMART GRID SYSTEMS 
In this section, we want to design a multi-objective H2/H∞ optimal dynamic pricing 
policy u t() for the mean feld stochastic smart grid network system from the optimal 
H2 working level tracking perspective to achieve the minimum quadratic tracking 
error under intrinsic random fuctuation and from the optimal robust H working ∞ 
level tracking perspective to minimize the worst-case effect of external disturbance 
from RESs and the constant vector b simultaneously. 
However, it is still diffcult to solve the multi-objective H2/H∞ dynamic pricing pol￾icy design problem in (14.16) directly. An indirect method is proposed to minimize 
the corresponding upper bounds simultaneously. 
Theorem 14.1: Suppose a b, are the upper bounds of the H2 and H∞ tracking per￾formance, respectively, that is, J u t a and J u( ( )) £ b . The MOP in (14.16) is 2 ( ( )) £ ¥ t

Before the proof of the theorem, the following defnitions for the MOP are given: 
Defnition 14.2: ([15]) Consider the MOP in (14.17). A feasible objective vec￾tor ( , a b1 ) a b2 ) 1 is said to dominate another feasible objective vector ( , 2 if 
and only if a1 £ a2 and b1 £ b2 for at least one inequality that is a strict 
inequality. * Defnition 14.3: ([15]) The solution u t( ) of the MOP in (14.17) is called a 
Pareto optimal solution with the corresponding objective vector ( , * * a b )if * ( , a b*
) is not dominated by another feasible objective vector ( , a b ). 
Proof: The proof of this theorem is straightforward. One only needs to prove that 
both inequality constraints on the MOP in (14.17) become equality for the Pareto 
optimal solution. We will show this by contradiction. Given a Pareto optimal solution 
* * u t( ) of the MOP in (14.17) with objective vector (, * a b ) , we assume that any one of
the inequalities in (14.17) remains a strict inequality in the optimal solution. Without 
loss of generality, suppose J u t a¢, such that a a a b ) dom- 2 ( ( )) = ¢ < * . As a result, ( ,¢ * 
inates the Pareto optimal solution ( , * * a b ) , leading to a contradiction of the previous
defnitions. This implies that both inequality constraints in (14.17) indeed become 
equalities for the Pareto optimal solution. The MOP in (14.17) is equivalent to the 
MOP in (14.16). 
Lemma 14.1: ([90]) For any real matrices A and B with appropriate dimensions, 
we have the following inequality for any nonzero real positive number g

Lemma 14.2: ([129]) Consider a Lyapunov function V( ( X t )) = XT ( )t PX( )t for the 
energy of the augmented mean feld stochastic smart grid network system in (14.12), 
and P P = T > 0. Then, the Itô-Lévy formula of V( ( X t)) is given as follows: 
E d{( V X(t ))} = E {( X t P X t u t ( )) ( ) Gu t ( ) ( ) T ( ) ( ( ) + G ( ) + Lv t + (FX t + ( ) + Lv t )

14.4 THE REVERSE-ORDER LMI-CONSTRAINED MOEA FOR 
MULTI-OBJECTIVE H2/H∞ DYNAMIC PRICING POLICY 
OF MEAN FIELD STOCHASTIC SMART GRID SYSTEMS 
For the multi-objective H2/H∞ dynamic pricing problem of the mean feld stochastic 
smart grid network system, it is not easy to solve the MOP in (14.23)–(14.28) by 
the conventional MOEA directly. In this section, a reverse-order LMI-constrained 
MOEA search is developed to help us solve the MOP in (14.23)–(14.28), that is, to 
update (, a b ) to search for { W > 0 ,W > 0 , , Y Y } using the LMI toolbox in MAT- 1 2 1 2 
LAB instead of updating the complex { W > 0 ,W > 0 ,, Y Y } to search for ( , a b ) in 1 2 1 2 
the conventional MOEA. Some important defnitions of Pareto optimality are given 
as follows: 
Defnition 14.4: ([15]) Let (, Y W , , Y W )and ( , Y W¢ ¢ ¢ , , Y W ¢) be the feasible 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 
solutions of MOP in (14.23) corresponding to the objective value ( , a b ) 
and ( , a b¢ ¢) subject to the LMIs in (24)–(28), respectively. If a a£ ¢ and 
b b £¢ with at least one inequality being a strict inequality, the solution
( , Y W ,, Y W ) is said to dominate the solution ( , Y W¢ ¢ ¢ , , Y W ¢). 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 
* * * * Defnition 14.5: ([15]) A solution (, YWYW , , ) with the objective value 1 1 2 2 
( , * * a b ) is said to be a Pareto optimal solution of (14.23) if there does not
exist any feasible solution (, Y W ,, Y W ) with the objective value ( , a b ) 1 1 2 2 
such that (, a b ) dominates ( , a b ) * * .

Defnition 14.6: ([15]) For the LMI-constrained MOP in (14.23)–(14.28) of the 
mean feld stochastic smart grid network system in (14.12), the Pareto front 
P is defned as: F 
ìï * * PF = í(, a b )
îï 
* * * * ( , YWYW ) ü 1 1 2 2 ,, is the Pareto optimal solution of MOP ï
ý in (14.23) with the corresponding objective vector ( , * * a b )þ ï
For the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA, the EA operates on a number of fea￾sible encoding objective vectors called a population so that a feasible objective k k vector ( , a b ) can be encoded into a chromosome Ck . The chromosome for the 
reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA uses the real-value representation to avoid 
long binary strings and a large search space. In general, the chromosomes perform 
the EA with ftness to generate the next population. To guarantee that all of these 
chromosomes can be decoded as feasible objective vectors for the MOP in (14.23), 
each chromosome Ck should be examined for the existence of a feasible solution 
( W > 0 ,W > 0 , , Y Y ) in (14.24)–(14.28) with the LMI toolbox in MATLAB after 1 2 1 2 
the mating operators. If the chromosomes are not feasible so that they cannot satisfy 
the LMIs in (14.24)–(14.28), the chromosomes will be deleted from the candidate 
chromosomes. 
The design procedure of the reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA for the MO 
H2/H∞ dynamic pricing policy of the mean feld stochastic smart grid system is pro￾posed as follows: 
Step 1: Select the search range S = [a ,a ] [ ´ b , b ] for the feasible min max min max 
objective vector ( , a b ) and set the iteration number N , the population N , max p 
the crossover rate Nc , and the mutation rate Nm in the reverse-order LMI￾constrained MOEA. 
Step 2: Randomly select Np feasible chromosomes from search region S as the 
initial population P1. 
Step 3: Set the iteration index Ni = 1. 
Step 4: Execute the EA operation with the crossover rate Nc and the muta￾tion rate Nm to PN and generate Np feasible chromosomes by examining i 
whether their corresponding objective vectors are feasible objective vectors 
for the LMIs in (14.24)–(14.28). 
Step 5: Set the iteration index N = N +1 and select N chromosomes from the i i p 
2Np feasible chromosomes in Step 4 through nondominated sorting method 
as the population PN . 
i 
Step 6: Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until the iteration number Nmax is reached. If the 
iteration number N is satisfed, then we set P = P . max N F i 
Step 7: Select a preferable feasible objective individual ( , * * Î F a b ) P according
to the designer’s preference. Once the preferable feasible objective individ￾ual is selected, the corresponding Pareto optimal solution is obtained. The * proposed multi-objective H2/H∞ dynamic pricing policy u() t = K X() t * * *- with K = Y W 1

14.5 SIMULATION RESULTS 
To illustrate the design procedure and to confrm the performance of the proposed 
MO H2/H∞ dynamic pricing policy for the stochastic mean feld smart grid network 
system, we introduce a stochastic mean feld smart grid network with continuous and 
discontinuous random fuctuation to mimic the real-world power market in (14.6). 
We consider the smart network consisting of a power grid and three microgrids in 
industrial, residential, and commercial areas, respectively. In order to mimic the real 
situation, we assume microgrids n = 12 ,, 3are industrial, residential, and commercial
areas, respectively, to construct a mean feld smart grid network. In general, the users 
of microgrids in industrial and commercial areas will consider a higher marginal ben￾eft function than the users of the microgrid in residential areas. Therefore, the related 
smart grid network parameters of the stochastic mean feld smart grid network are 
given in Table 14.1. 
To mimic a real power market system, the power market dynamic model should be 
modifed by continuous and discontinuous intrinsic random fuctuations [416, 417]. 
The Wiener process is used to describe the users of the microgrid randomly changing 
their demand behavior due to random factors like rumors in the power market and 
weather changes, and the Poisson counting process is used to describe sudden ran￾dom fuctuations like economic events and policy changes, with the jump intensity 
of three microgrids as: l = 0 0., 5 l = 0 03 . ., l = 0 05. 1 2 3 
Due to continuous and discontinuous fuctuations, the power demand in the power 
market system will be disturbed, and power demand information cannot be directly 
used for pricing policy design. In the proposed mean feld stochastic smart grid net￾work system, collective behavior is introduced to mimic the average (mean) behavior 
of each microgrid. As a result, by using the information of states and mean states, 
the designed MO H2/H∞ pricing policy can not only achieve great reference tracking 
performance but also have a certain attenuation of the stochastic effect. The matrix 
for the effect of mean demand on each microgrid in (14.6) is given as follows:

In the real situation, each microgrid may need its own desired working level to 
maintain operation in a stage of emergency. For example, the microgrids in the res￾idential area do not need a higher working level between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. because 
residential users of the microgrid are working in other areas. However, commercial 
and industrial areas need to maintain a higher working level between 8 a.m. and 6 
p.m. because they are at the peak of electricity consumption. The users of microgrids 
in industrial, residential, and business areas have their own desired working levels, 
which are generated by the reference model in (14.3) with a = a = a = -1 and 1 2 3

The MO H2/H∞ pricing policy of the MOP in (14.6) is employed by the manager 
of the smart grid to design a pricing policy to make the stored energy s t( ) of each n

( ) in (14.3) such that the microgrids can 
maintain operation in an emergency. The weighting matrices for the H2 performance 
in (14.14) and H∞ performance in (14.15) are given as follows: 
m z m Q = Q = Q = diag( , 101, ,1), R = R = 0.1 1 1 1 1 1 (14.29) m z m Q = Q = Q = diag(, 101, ,1 ), R = R = 0 0. 5 2 2 2 2 2 
According to the weighting matrices in (14.29), the weighting parameters in the 
frst and third states are greater than the weighting parameter in the second state. This 
reveals the pricing policy design strategy will focus more on the tracking error of the 
microgrids in the industrial and commercial areas.

Wind generation is considered for the generation of RESs in each microgrid. To 
mimic the real-world wind generation of the RESs, the data of the wind generation 
in three different regions are employed from PJM Interconnection [418], which is a 
regional transmission organization that coordinates the movement of wholesale elec￾tricity. The generation of wind power of r t( ), n = , , n 12 3 MW in 50 hours is shown in 
Figure 14.1. 
Based on the proposed design procedure of MO H2/H dynamic pricing pol- ∞ 
icy, the reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA is employed to solve the MOP in 
Theorem 14.3. In the reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA, the search region 
S = [900 1000, ][ , ] ´ i 1000 1200 , the iteration number N = 50, the population number 
N = 500, crossover rate N = 0 9. , and mutation rate N = 0 1. are given. When the p c m 
iteration number is achieved, the Pareto front PF for the MOP of the pricing pol￾icy for the mean feld smart grid network in (14.6) can be obtained, as shown in 
Figure 14.2. 
In this simulation, the knee solution in Pareto front is chosen as the dynamic pric￾ing policy of the mean feld smart grid network system since the knee point has 
balanced performance between H2 and H∞, and the dynamic pricing policy in (14.13) * * * can be obtained. The corresponding controller gain KKK , , can be given as 1 2 3

The dynamic pricing policy plays an important role in managing imbalanced energy 
in the mean feld smart grid network. In general, it is expected that the pricing policy 
has an appropriate effect on the power demand and supply of each microgrid to meet 
their desired stored energy levels. In general, in the conventional power market, the 
power price is a positive value depending on the buying and selling behavior of the 
power market. However, in the smart grid system, due to the higher cost of shutdown 
and ramp-up of a power plant, the power grid will send surplus power that cannot be 
stored to the microgrid with a negative price to encourage consumers to consume the 
microgrid surplus power [419–421]. Due to the uncertain initial conditions in each 
microgrid, the effect of negative prices appears in Figure 14.3 at the beginning; that 
is, the pricing policy oscillates at the beginning. Then the proposed pricing policy 
achieves the desired reference working level due to the proposed integrator-based 
state feedback control but with price fuctuation due to the uncertainty of the RESs 
and random fuctuation. It is worth pointing out that the pricing policy for the mean 
feld smart grid network system and price vibration are used to against external dis￾turbance from RESs and continuous and discontinuous random fuctuations. 
FIGURE 14.2 After the iteration number of the dynamic H2/H∞ pricing policy is achieved, 
the corresponding Pareto front of the Pareto optimal solution set is plotted. Each point in the 
Pareto front is a Pareto optimal solution. The marked point is the knee point.  
Multi-Objective Optimal H 375 2/H∞ Dynamic Pricing Management 
FIGURE 14.3 The proposed MO H2/H∞ dynamic pricing policy for the mean feld stochas￾tic smart grid network. 
Figures 14.4–14.6 show the tracking performance of proposed pricing policy for the 
mean feld smart grid network. Due to the effect of negative price by the designed MO 
H2/H∞ pricing policy, the three microgrids receive high power at frst. For the microgrids 
in industrial and commercial areas, the designed MO H2/H∞ pricing policy can achieve 
great tracking performance to achieve the desired reference stored energy; that is, the 
stored energy states s t() and s t() can achieve their desired reference stored energy 1 3 d d states s t() and s t( ), respectively. Thus, the proposed MO H2/H∞ pricing policy can 1 3 
effectively adjust the power demand and supply of the microgrids in the industrial and 
commercial areas to achieve the desired stored energy level. For the microgrid in the res￾idential area, there exists a large transient tracking response during the tracking process. 
This phenomenon is caused by the weighting matrices in (14.29) since the designed pric￾ing policy puts much emphasis on the microgrids in the industrial and commercial areas. 
On other hand, if we pay more attention to the desired work tracking performance 
of the microgrid in the residential area than to those of the other microgrids, the 
weighting matrices in (14.29) can be redesigned as follows: 
m z m Q = Q = Q = diag( . 01101 ,, , ), R = R = 0 1. 1 1 1 1 1 (14.30) m z m Q = Q = Q = diag( . 0 1, , 1, 01 ), R = R = 0 0. 5 2 2 2 2 2 
Based on the weighting matrices in (14.30), the pricing policy design strategy will 
focus more on the tracking error of the microgrids in the residential area. 376 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

Multi-Objective Optimal H 379 2/H∞ Dynamic Pricing Management 
the designed pricing policy focuses on the tracking performance of microgrid 2, 
and the desired working level in the residential area can be achieved. As a result, 
microgrid 2 (residential) has better tracking performance of stored energy than 
microgrids 1 and 3. 
14.6 CONCLUSION 
In this chapter, we consider a mean feld stochastic smart grid network to describe 
the power demand behavior of microgrids, which interact through collective (mean) 
demand behavior with external disturbance from RESs and continuous and discon￾tinuous random fuctuations. The managers of a smart grid network always expect 
that the stored energy state of each microgrid not only can track the desired working 
level to maintain normal operation in emergence with a parsimonious price but also 
attenuate the effect of the external disturbance from the RESs. Thus, a novel MO 
H2/H∞ pricing policy for energy management in a mean feld smart grid network has 
been proposed for microgrids to achieve their own desired reference working lev￾els. In order to effectively eliminate the effect of constants in the marginal cost and 
beneft function, an integrator-based state feedback control is employed for the MO 
H2/H∞ dynamic pricing policy design. An indirect method is proposed to simplify 
the design problem of the MO H2/H∞ dynamic pricing policy. Finally, the LMI-con￾strained MOP can be solved effciently by the proposed LMI-constrained MOEA to 
fnd the Pareto front for the Pareto optimal solutions of the MOP. The managers of 
the smart grid can select their own preferred pricing policy from the set of Pareto 
optimal pricing policies. Finally, a simulation example of a power grid with three 
microgrids in different areas is given to confrm the tracking performance of the 
desired stored energy state with the proposed MO H2/H∞ pricing policy design for 
mean feld stochastic smart grid network systems. From the simulation results, with 
the chosen weighting matrices, the specifc microgrids in the smart grid network can 
access their own desired tracking performance for stored energy.

Mean Field Stochastic 
Systems: Multi-Objective 
Optimization Evolutionary 
Algorithm Approach 
15.1 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, mean feld stochastic systems and investigations on them have gained 
widespread attention [422–424]. The appearance of the mean term in the system or 
the cost function makes the optimal design of the system more complicated than 
that of the classical stochastic system. Many researchers have studied the mean feld 
stochastic system [7, 105, 107, 159, 425–427] and applied it to diverse areas like 
fnance [428], biology [429, 430], and smart grids [431, 432]. A mean feld stochas￾tic system was used to model inter-bank borrowing and lending between N banks in 
[428], and the authors investigated the system risk problem and Nash equilibrium of 
the fnancial system. Algorithms to sample scale-free networks in molecular biology 
have been analyzed in the mean feld sense [429]. The growth and evolution of a pro￾tein–protein interaction network were investigated by a mean feld approach [430]. 
A stochastic noncooperative mean feld game in a mean feld stochastic system can 
describe competitiveness in smart grids [431]. Economic analysis of electric vehi￾cles in a smart grid used a tool from a mean feld stochastic system [432]. In most 
of these applications, individuals considered the effect of the mean feld term as the 
collective behaviors resulting from all individuals’ mutual interaction in the social 
system through the internet to be marvelous nowadays. These applications can also 
be classifed as applications of cyber-social systems. Cyber-social systems comprise 
various social interactions in society, such as social welfare optimization problems, 
386 DOI: 10.1201/9781003362142-19 Multi-Player Noncooperative and Cooperative Game Strategies 387 
markets, and transportation. However, there is not a method to consider a general￾ized cyber-social system by a mean feld stochastic system because the category of 
cyber-social systems is too large. 
Another common tool to consider the collective behaviors of all individuals in 
a large-population system is game theory. It is an effective approach to analyze 
the behaviors of multiple players based on their goals or interests. Game theory 
has been applied to diverse areas, such as the design of population biological net￾works [433], bandwidth allocation in 4G heterogeneous wireless access networks 
[434], and optimal scheduling of parking-lot electric vehicle charging systems 
[435]. Based on the different relations between individuals (players) in the game, 
games can be classifed into two types: noncooperative and cooperative. In nonco￾operative games, players compete with each other to pursue their maximum bene￾fts [433, 436–439]. In cooperative games, players reach a compromise due to the 
enforcement of rules by external authorities [440–442]. In noncooperative games, 
it is notoriously diffcult to design optimal strategies for each player because it is 
hard to design strategies to control the system to achieve multiple desired goals for 
each player. 
Further, in noncooperative games, the concept of Nash equilibrium is crucial to 
analyze the performance of players’ strategies. A strategy profle is a Nash equilib￾rium solution if none of the players can obtain more benefts by unilaterally changing 
strategy. To fnd the Nash equilibrium solution for noncooperative games in stochas￾tic systems, many iteratively updating algorithms like the extreme seeking method 
have been presented [443–447]. In the aforementioned updating algorithm, the time 
of convergence of the iterative approximation to Nash equilibrium can be extremely 
long if the initial approximation is far from the Nash equilibrium. Further, these iter￾ative algorithms cannot search all Nash equilibrium points. If there is a direct method 
to compute all Nash equilibrium solutions, the Nash equilibrium solutions can be 
guaranteed after a certain amount of computational effort. There are few studies on 
fnding Nash equilibrium solutions for noncooperative game strategy in mean feld 
stochastic systems by direct methods. 
Up to now, in the feld of mean feld control, many studies only consider the effect 
of continuous random fuctuations and external disturbance; few consider discontin￾uous random fuctuations. In general, the effect of discontinuous random fuctuations 
is not negligible in the real world. On the other hand, many researchers have studied 
control and applications of noncooperative and cooperative games, but noncoopera￾tive and cooperative games under collective (mean) behaviors are rarely discussed. 
To get a thorough understanding of the interactions of the players in a stochastic 
system under the infuence of collective behavior, noncooperative and cooperative 
games for the MFSJD system are discussed. 
In this chapter, stochastic noncooperative and cooperative H∞ tracking game 
strategy problems are discussed for a class of MFSJD system with m players suffer￾ing from unknown external disturbance and continuous and discontinuous random 
fuctuations. First, a novel utility function based on minimax H∞ model reference 
tracking performance is proposed for each player in the noncooperative and coop￾erative games to achieve their own desired model reference trajectory. If the util￾ity functions are minimized, then the Nash equilibrium solutions of the stochastic 388 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
noncooperative and cooperative H∞ tracking games can be found. To fnd the Nash 
equilibrium solutions, an indirect approach is introduced to transform the noncoop￾erative and cooperative H∞ model reference tracking game strategy design problems 
to an LMI-constrained MOP and SOP of the MFSJD system, respectively. We also 
prove the Pareto optimal solutions of the LMI-constrained MOP are the Nash equi￾librium solutions of the stochastic noncooperative H∞ tracking game strategy design 
problems for the MFSJD system, respectively. Due to the convexity of LMIs, the 
Pareto optimal solutions of the LMI-constrained MOP could be obtained by a paral￾lel search scheme via the proposed reverse-order LMI-constrained multi-objective 
evolution algorithm with the help of the convex optimization toolbox in MAT￾LAB. Since the number of parameters of all noncooperative game strategies is very 
large, especially for a large number of players, the proposed reverse-order LMI￾constrained MOEA method can effciently solve all the Nash equilibrium solutions 
of the stochastic noncooperative H∞ tracking game strategy design problem. Two 
simulation examples of market share allocation and network security strategy in a 
cyber-social system are given to illustrate the design procedure and validate the per￾formance of the noncooperative and cooperative H∞ tracking games in an MFSJD 
system, respectively. 
The purposes of this chapter can be summarized as follows: 
• In this chapter, the MFSJD system takes a continuous Wiener process, dis￾continuous Poisson process, and external disturbance into account simul￾taneously to mimic more realistic phenomena in mean feld stochastic 
systems. Based on the MFSJD system, unlike the conventional stabilization 
game in [444–447], the multi-player noncooperative and cooperative H∞ 
model reference tracking game strategy design problems are studied. 
• By the proposed indirect method, the multi-player noncooperative and 
cooperative H∞ tracking game strategy design problem in the MFSJD sys￾tem can be transformed into an equivalent LMI-constrained MOP and SOP 
for the MFSJD system, respectively. By solving the LMI-constrained MOP 
and SOP, the multi-player noncooperative and cooperative H∞ tracking 
game strategies in the MFSJD system can be effciently obtained without 
solving the minimax cost function directly. 
• Different from the previous iteratively updating algorithm to search for the 
Nash equilibrium solution, the reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA is 
proposed to parallel search for the Pareto front to obtain all Nash equi￾librium solutions of the multi-player noncooperative H∞ model reference 
tracking game strategies, which can be effciently applied to the market 
share allocation and network security strategy in cyber-social systems. 
This chapter is divided into seven sections as follows. Section 15.2 is dedicated 
to the noncooperative H∞ tracking game problem formulation of the MFSJD system. 
The strategy design of the noncooperative H∞ tracking game is given in Section 15.3. 
Section 15.4 presents the cooperative H∞ tracking game problem formulation and its 
solution. Section 15.5 introduces the reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA and its 
design procedure for the multi-player noncooperative H∞ tracking game strategy of

the MFSJD system. In Section 15.6, two simulation examples of noncooperative and 
cooperative H∞ tracking games are given to validate the accuracy and effciency of 
the proposed reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA and design strategy. Finally, the 
conclusion is given in Section 15.7.

15.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND PROBLEM FORMULATION 
Consider the following MFSJD system with m players defned on the fltration prob￾ability space (, , t W F F P)[448]:
dx t() = [ ( Axt ) + AEx( ) t +å 
m
B u t( ) + v t( )]dt ii 
i=1 
+ (( Lx t) + LE xt ( )) dw t N () + ( ( xt xt ) + NE ( )) dp t ( ) (15.1) 
x( ) 0 = x0 
n where the càdlàg process x t() Î ˜ denotes the state vector of a mean feld stochastic m system; Ex( )t represents the expected value of the state vector x t( ); u t() Î ˜ is i 2 + n the admissible control strategy of the ith player; v t() Î LF ( , ˜ ˜ ) indicates the un￾known fnite energy external disturbance; w t( ) is the standard 1-dimensional Wiener 
process; and p t( ) denotes the standard 1-dimensional Poisson counting process with 
jump intensity l in a unit time. The term (( Lx t ) + L Ex( td )) w t() indicates continuous 
state and mean state-dependent random fuctuations; the term (( Nx t ) + NEx( t d )) p t() 
represents discontinuous and mean state-dependent random fuctuations. The Pois￾son counting process p t( ) and the Wiener process w t( ) are assumed to be independ￾ent of each other. AB , ,i A,, L L,N and N are deterministic real-value system matrices 
with appropriate dimensions. 
Remark 15.1: The important properties of the Poisson counting process p t( ) and 
the Wiener process w t( ) are listed as follows [20]: E d{ ( p t)} = ldt, where the fnite 
scalar number l > 0 is the Poisson jump intensity; E d{ ( p t)} dt = 0; E d{ ( p t) ( dw t )} = 0;
E d{ ( wt )} = 0; and E d{ ( w t)} dt = 0. 
In (15.1), both the state vector x t( ) and the mean (collective) term Ex( )t affect 
the system dynamic of the MFSJD system. It makes the MFSJD system more com￾plicated to design than a conventional stochastic system because the designer has to 
take two dynamic system states x t( ) and Ex( )t into account. To simplify the game 
strategy design procedure of the MFSJD system, the decoupling method is employed 
to separate the MFSJD system in (15.1) into two orthogonal subsystems: a mean 
subsystem Ex( )t and variation subsystem xt ˇ() = xt () - Ex( )t .
By taking the expectation of the MFSJD system in (15.1), then the mean subsys￾tem Ex( )t is given as follows:  
 -

dExt = [( + + l(NN Ex t + Evt +å 
m 
() A A + )) ( ) ( ) B Eu t( )]dt (15.2) i i 
i=1 
where Eui( )t is the mean of the control strategy u t( ) of the ith player. Then the vari- i 
ation subsystem x t ˇ( ) can be obtained by subtracting the MFSJD system in (15.1) by 
the mean subsystem in (15.2) as follows: 
N N Ex t å 
m
dxˇ( )t = [ ( Ax t ˇ ) - l( + ) ( ) + B u t ˇ ( )] i i( ) + v t ˇ dt i=1 (15.3) 
+ ( ( Lx t ) + L Ex(t d )) wt () + ( ( Nx t ) + NEx(t d )) p t() 
where ut ˇ () = ut () - Eu ( )t and vt ˇ() = vt () - Ev( )t . i i i 
In the noncooperative game, the players try to apply their strategy to pursue their 
maximum proft. However, the objectives of the players are conficting, and the play￾ers have to compete with each other to beneft most [436]. The players are assumed 
to be incapable of communicating with each other, so the strategy of each player is 
unavailable to their competitors. In the MFSJD system, the goal of the ith player is 
to drive the mean term Ex( )t to track their desired trajectory and eliminate the var￾iations around the mean in (15.3). Suppose the reference trajectory x t( ) of the ith ri 
player is generated by a reference model as follows: 
dx ( )t = (A x t( ) + r t( ))dt (15.4) r r r i i i i 
where A is a deterministic asymptotically stable matrix, and r t( ) is a bounded ref- r i i
erence input. Ar i and rt ( ) are both given by the ith player. In general, A and r t( ) r i i i 
determine the transient and steady state of the reference model. At the steady state, -1 the reference system state x t( ) is equal to -A r ( )t . For example, if we choose r r i i i 
A = -I in (15.4), then x t() = r t( ) at the steady state. In this situation, r t( ) could r r i i i i 
be set as the desired target of the ith player to simplify the design procedure of track￾ing game strategy of the MFSJD system. If the reference system x t( ) in (15.4) is ri 
subtracted from mean subsystem Ex( )t in (15.2), then the tracking error dynamic of 
mean e t() = Ex() t - x ( )t is given as follows: i ri 
i )) ( ) Ev t B Eu t i de t() = [(A + A + l(N + N Ext + ( ) +å ( )
m
i 
i=1 (15.5) 
- ( ( ) Ax t + r( t d ))] t r r i i i 
After two subsystems, the variation subsystem xt ˇ( ) in (15.3) and the subsystem of
tracking error e t( ) in (15.5), have been obtained, the noncooperative game strategies i 
of the MFSJD system will be designed as follows: For each player, if the mean of the 
MFSJD system Ex( )t in (15.2) can optimally track one’s desired trajectory x t( ) in ri 
(15.4) as possible and the variation x t ˇ( ) in (15.3) around the mean Ex( )t of the MFS￾JD system is simultaneously minimized despite competitive strategies and external 
disturbance, then each player will beneft most.

In the stochastic noncooperative game strategy design problem of the MFSJD sys￾tem, to be on the safe side, the ith player designs and decomposes their strategy u t( ) i

ative minimax H∞ game of the MFSJD system in (15.6) is that the worst-case effect 
of competitive strategies u t( ), uncertain external disturbance v t( ), and reference -i 
signal r t() should be minimized with parsimonious mean control effort Eui( )t and i 
variation control strategy ˇi ut ( ).
Remark 15.2: In the conventional noncooperative dynamic game, each player 
considers the stabilization problem only with different weighting matrices in their 
cost function. For the proposed mean-feld noncooperative tracking game strategy, 
each player has a respective desired tracking target. This means each player wants 
to achieve their optimal tracking control performance despite the effect of the com￾petitive strategies of other players. Also, to be on the safe side, the worst-case effect 
of the competitive strategies, external disturbance, and variation between the system 
state and mean state on the target tracking performance is to be minimized. 
For simplicity of design, the variation subsystem x t ˇ( ) in (15.3), tracking error 
subsystem e t( ) in (15.5), and reference system x t( ) in (15.4) can be combined as i ri

noncooperative game strategy design problem in (15.9) for an MFSJD system in 
(15.7) or (15.8) directly. Therefore, the following indirect approach or the so-called 
stochastic suboptimal approach is applied to simplify the design procedure of the 
stochastic noncooperative game strategy in (15.9). Suppose there exists an upper

where gi

minimax noncooperative H game problem is equivalent to the following multi- ∞ 
objective optimization problem by minimizing gi

The solution of the MOP in (15.11) and (15.12) is not unique, and all solutions are 
called Pareto optimal solutions. The following defnitions are needed to defne the 
Pareto optimal solutions for the MOP. 
Defnition 15.1 (Pareto Dominance) [2, 77, 205 206, 389]: For the MOP in 1 1 1 (15.11) and (15.12), a feasible solution (( Ut ),...,U t( ),...,Ut ( )) correspond- 1 i m 
1 1 1 ing to the objective vector ( , g g ..., g ,..., ) is said to dominate another 1 i m 
2 2 2 feasible solution (( Ut ),...,U t( ),...,U t( )) corresponding to the objective 1 i m 
2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 vector ( , g ..., g ,..., g ) if g £ g ,..., g £ g ,..., g £ g and at least one of 1 i m 1 1 i i m m 
the inequalities is a strict inequality. 
Defnition 15.2 (Pareto Optimal Solution) [2, 77, 205 206, 389]: A feasible * * * solution (( Ut ),...,U t( ),...,U t( )) of the MOP in (15.11) and (15.12) is said 1 i m 
to be a Pareto optimal solution if there does not exist another feasible solu￾tion (( Ut ),...,U t( ),...,U t( )) that can dominate it. 1 i m 
Defnition 15.3 (Pareto Optimal Set) [2, 77, 205 206, 389]: For the

solution in (15.11) and (15.12)}. 
Defnition 15.4 (Pareto Front) [2, 77, 205 206, 389]: For the 
MOP in (15.11) and (15.12), the Pareto front is defned as * * * * * * * T ˆ {(g ,..., g ,..., g ) (U t( ),...,U t( ),...,U t( )) Îs }; that is, the Pareto F 1 i m 1 i m 
front collects the objective vector of Pareto optimal solution. 
Remark 15.3: The concept of the Nash equilibrium solution is introduced to con￾sider the solution of the noncooperative minimax H game in (15.9) [436, 449]. ∞ 
In the game theory, if each player has chosen a strategy, and no player can beneft 
by changing their own strategy while other players keep their strategies unchanged, 
then the current set of strategies and their corresponding pay-off constitutes a Nash 
equilibrium solution. In general, there exist a large number of Nash equilibrium solu- * * * tions. In this chapter, the Nash equilibrium game strategy ( ( U t),...,U t( ),...,U t( )) 1 i m * * * constitutes a Nash equilibrium objective vector ( , g g ..., g ,..., ) if and only if the 1 i m 
following inequalities are established: 
* * * * * * * ( , g 1 ..., gi m ,..., g )( £ g1 ,..., gi-1 , , g g i i+1 ,..., gm ),i = 1,2,...,m
* * * To fnd the Nash equilibrium solutions (( Ut ),...,U t( ),...,U t( )) and their cor- 1 i m 
* * * responding Nash equilibrium objective vectors ( , g g ..., g ,..., ) of the stochastic 1 i m 
* * * multi-player noncooperative H∞ game problem in (15.9), ( , g ..., g ,..., g ) can be 1 i m 
obtained indirectly by minimizing the corresponding upper bounds gi by solving the 
MOP in (15.11) and (15.12). 
Theorem 15.1: The MOP in (15.11) and (15.12) is equivalent to the multi-player 
noncooperative minimax H∞ reference tracking game in (15.9) for the MFSJD sys￾tem in (15.7) if the MOP solution in (15.11) and (15.12) is obtained. 
Proof: We only need to prove the inequality constraints in (15.12) will dis￾appear when the Pareto optimal solutions are obtained. This can be proven by * * * contradiction. Let ( , g g ..., g ,..., ) be a Pareto optimal solution of (15.11), and 1 i m 
suppose one of the inequality constraints in (15.12) strictly holds; that is, there 
exists gi such that

g = min max 0 < g *

* * * * * Then ( , g ..., g ,..., g ) dominates ( , g ..., g ,..., g ) However, according to Defni- 1 i m 1 i m 
* * * tion 15.1, the Pareto optimal objective vector ( , g g ..., g ,..., ) is not dominated by 1 i m 
another objective vector, which leads to a contradiction of the assumption. Thus, 
when the Pareto optimal solution of the MOP in (15.11) and (15.12) is obtained, 
the inequalities in (15.12) all disappear, and the solution of the MOP is equal to the 
solution of the multiplayer noncooperative game in (15.9).  
 
Multi-Player Noncooperative and Cooperative Game Strategies 395 
Based on Defnitions 15.1–15.4 and Theorem 15.1, the simultaneous minimization 
of ( , 1 ..., gi ,..., m g g ) for MOP in (15.11) is to fnd the Pareto optimal objective vector * * * ( , g g ..., g ,..., ). Since the minimization of the numerator in (15.12) is independent 1 i m 
of U t( ), the MOP in (15.11) with m minimax constraints in (15.12) is equivalent to -i 
the following MOP with m constrained stochastic Nash quadratic game inequalities 
[34, 436, 450, 451, 452]:

then two steps are required to solve the m constrained stochastic Nash quadratic

game problems: 
J * = min max ( J U t( ), U t( )),i = 1 2, ,...,m (15.16) i i i -i i () Ut U-i ( )t 
and the second step is to solve the inequality-constrained problem

By solving (15.16) and (15.17) for the constrained stochastic Nash quadratic game 
in (15.14), the m-player noncooperative stochastic game strategies in (15.9) can be 
found by solving an MOP with the constraints of m Riccati-like inequalities in the 
sequel. The following two lemmas are introduced to help us solve m constrained 
stochastic Nash quadratic games in (15.14) or (15.16) and (15.17):

optimal solutions are equal to the Nash equilibrium solutions, the following theorem 
is needed.

and P*
 in (15.20) are the Nash equilibrium solutions of the m-player noncooperative 
stochastic game in (15.9) for the MFSJD system in (15.7). 
Proof: It will be proven by contradiction. Suppose the condition of the Nash 
equilibrium solution in Remark 15.3 is violated for a Pareto optimal solution * * * * * * (( U t),...,U t( ),..., Ut ( )) in (12) with the objective vector ( , g ..., g ,..., g ) for the 1 i m 1 i m 
ith inequality; that is, there exists a gi such that 
* * * * * * * ( , g ..., g ,..., g )( £ g ,..., g g, ,g ,..., g ) 1 i m 1 i-1 i i+1 m 
* * Then, there exists a solution (( Ut ),...,U ( )t ,...,U t( )) in (15.12) with ob- 1 i m 
jective vector ( , * ..., g ,..., g * g ) that dominates the Pareto optimal solution 1 i m 
* * * * * * U t Ut Ut m ( ( 1 ),...,U t i ( ),..., m ( )). However, it reveals (( ),...,U t i ( ),...,U t( )) is not the 1 
Pareto optimal solution in (15.12), and it leads to a contradiction to the assumption. 
Thus, this shows that the Pareto optimal solution in (15.12) is the Nash equilibrium 
solution in (15.9). 
Remark 15.4: To solve the Riccati-like inequalities in (15.21), we apply a Schur 
complement transformation [212] to transform (15.21) into the following LMIs after 
multiplying W P 1 = by both sides of (15.21): -

Therefore, the MOP in (15.20) for the noncooperative H∞ reference tracking game

15.4 COOPERATIVE H∞ TRACKING GAME STRATEGY 
DESIGN FOR MFSJD SYSTEMS 
If m players in (15.1) have reached a consensus to achieve a common desired tra￾jectory x t() with each other at the beginning of the game, then all players will col- r 
laborate with each other to control the mean of state vector Ex( )t to track common 
desired trajectory x t( ), which is generated by the following reference model. r 
dxr t = (A xt r () ( ) r + r t( ))dt (15.26) 
In the cooperative stochastic game, players cooperate together with their strat- T T T egies ut = [( ut ),..., m ( )] to minimize the tracking error (( Ex t ) - xr () t 1 ut ( )) and the 
deviation (( xt ) - Ex( t)) under the worst-case effect of external disturbance v t( ) and 
reference input r t( ) despite continuous and discontinuous intrinsic random fuctua￾tions. Let us denote x t ˇ() = x t() - Ex( )t , e t() = Ex() t - x ( )t , and u t ˇ() = u t() - Eu( )t . c r 
Then the stochastic cooperative minimax H∞ tracking game of the MFSJD system is 
formulated as follows: 
ò f T T E t 
[ ( xˇ t Q) x t ˇ( ) + e t( )Q e ( )t 1 c 2 0 c

where Q1 > 0 is the corresponding weighting matrix on the deviation xt ˇ( ), Q2 > 0

the corresponding weighting matrix on the deviation of the strategy u t ˇ( ), and 
R2 > 0 is the corresponding weighting matrix on the mean of the strategy Eu( )t . 
E xT ()() x 0 ) + ( c
T ( )ec ( ˇ 0 ˇ E e 0 ( ) 0 ) considers the effect of the uncertain initial condition 
of x t ˇ( ) and e t c ( ) on the reference tracking performance. g0
 denotes the performance 
of the cooperative minimax H∞ tracking game of the MFSJD system. The physical 
meaning of the stochastic cooperative minimax H∞ tracking game in (15.27) is that 
the worst-case effect of uncertain external disturbance v t( ) and reference trajectory 
r t( ) on the MFSJD system should be minimized by the parsimonious mean strategy 
Eu( )t and deviation strategy u t ˇ( ). 
Similar to the augmented MFSJD system X t i ( ) in (15.7), an augmented MFSJD T T T system for the cooperative game Xt () ˆ [ ( x t ˇ ),e t( ), ( x t)] could also be obtained as c r

15.5 LMI-CONSTRAINED MOEA OF NONCOOPERATIVE 
MINMAX H∞ GAME STRATEGY FOR MULTI-PLAYER 
TARGET TRACKING OF MFSJD SYSTEMS 
The MOEA has long been a popular algorithm to solve MOPs [453, 454]. It is a 
stochastic algorithm inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, muta￾tion, recombination, and selection. Based on the MOEA, we can search the global 
optimal solutions with multiple conficting objectives at the same time and do not 
need to divide the original problem into several sub-problems to parallel search 
[436, 450]. There are many MOEAs adapted from NSGA-II, but most of them 
have algebraic functional constraints [133, 455, 456]. With conventional MOEAs, 
we need to search the parameters of W* > 0 to solve the MOP in (15.25). For the 
noncooperative H∞ reference tracking game strategy, the Pareto optimal solutions * -1 * * *-1 3 3´ U t() = -R B P X ( )t i, = 1 2, ,...,m P, = W . Since W R Î n n, it is very diffcult i i i i 
to search all components of the W* > 0 from the MOP in (15.25) by conventional 
MOEAs when n becomes large. To simplify the solving procedure of the MOP in 
(15.25), a reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA is proposed to simplify the MOP 
in (15.25) by searching ( , 1 ..., gi ,..., m g g ) indirectly and then solving W from LMIs
in (15.23) and (15.24) via the LMI toolbox in MATLAB instead of searching W * * * directly to solve ( , g ..., g ,..., g ). After solving ( , g ..., g ,..., g ), we can solve the 1 i m 1 i m 
corresponding W* > 0 from (15.23) and (15.24) with the LMI toolbox in MATLAB 402 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications 
indirectly. The detailed design procedure of the reverse-order LMI-constrained 
MOEA approach for the MOP in (15.25) of the m-player noncooperative minimax 
H∞ game strategy design problem in the MFSJD system in (15.1) is given as follows: 
Reverse-Order LMI-Constrained MOEA for the m-Player Noncooperative 
Reference Tracking Game Strategy of the MFSJD System 
L U L U L U Step 1: Select the search range S = [, g g ]´°´[g , g ]´°´ [, g g ], where 1 1 i i m m 
U gL
 and g i, = 1 2, ,...,m represent the lower bound and upper bound of the i i 
* * * Pareto optimal solution ( , g ..., g ,..., g ). Choose the population number N , 1 i m p 
iteration number NI , crossover rate Rc , and mutation rate Rm , and set the 
initial iteration number I = 1. 
Step 2: Choose Np feasible individuals as the initial populations K1 from the 
search regions. 
Step 3: Employ the mutation and crossover operators to generate another Np 
feasible individuals and add to the initial population by checking the LMIs 
in (15.23) and (15.24) to see if their corresponding ( , 1 ..., gi ,..., m g g ) are 
feasible. 
Step 4: Choose Np elite individuals from 2Np feasible individuals generated 
in step 3 via the nondominated sorting scheme and the crowded compari￾son method. Place the iteration number I I = +1 and update the population 
as KI . 
Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until I N> I ; then set the fnal population KI F = T
as the Pareto front and stop the iteration. * * * Step 6: Choose a desired feasible objective vector ( , g1 ..., gi m F ,..., g ) ÎT * * - according to the designer’s preference with the optimal W P = () 1
, where 
W*
 is the preferable optimal solution of the MOP in (15.25). Moreover, the * * * * -1 T * corresponding control strategy ( , U ...,U ,...,U ), U t() = -R B P X ( )t 1 i m i 1 i i 
is obtained for the noncooperative minimax H∞ reference tracking game 
strategy in (15.6) for an MFSJD system in (15.1) 
Remark 15.5: For the proposed MOEA, the search region S can be chosen as L U L U L m S = [, g g ]´°´[g , g ] . In general, the lower bound { } g can be obtained by 1 1 m m j i=1 
solving the SOP, which is constructed by selecting one objective with correspond￾ing constraints of the MOP in (15.23)–(15.25). On the other hand, the upper bound U m L m U L { } g can be chosen as several times of {} g ; that is, g = ag , for some a > 1. j i=1 j i=1 j j 
Remark 15.6: In the proposed reverse-order LMI-constrained MOEA, the con￾straints are limited to a class of linear matrix inequality constraints. Hence, before 
using the proposed algorithm for nonlinear constrained MOPs, the nonlinear con￾straints should be linearized as a set of linear inequality constraints in different local 
regions. Recently, in the feld of control system design, several local linearization 
interpolation methods have been utilized for controller synthesis of nonlinear sys￾tems, such as the fuzzy interpolation method, global linearization method, and so 
on. Thus, based on these local linearization interpolation methods, the proposed 
LMI-constrained MOEA can be further applied to solve the multi-objective control￾ler design problem of nonlinear systems.

15.6 SIMULATION EXAMPLES IN CYBER-SOCIAL SYSTEMS 
In this section, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LMI-constrained 
MOEA for the following MOP of the noncooperative minimax H∞ tracking game 
strategy and the SOP of the cooperative minimax H∞ tracking game strategy for the 
MFSJD system, we give two simulation examples of cyber-social system based on 
previous research.

(1) Noncooperative H∞ Reference Tracking Game Strategy: Consider a fnan￾cial resource allocation problem for market share adapted from [457], in
which two frms and the government compete with each other for the mar￾ket share. For such a noncooperative game, the two frms can be seen as
players 1 and 2, and the government can be seen as player 3. Players hope
they can get the maximum proft by controlling the share price via their
purchase or sale of the share. However, the market share suffers from the
competitive strategy of the other players, external disturbance, and contin￾uous and discontinuous random events like rumors in the market, changes
of policy, tariff impositions, and oil price changes. The market share is
also infuenced by the average behavior and collective predictions about
the market share. A noncooperative minimax H∞ tracking game in (15.6)
with three players on the MFSJD system is used to describe the competi￾tiveness of the market share. The MFSJD system of the market share in
[457] is given as follows:
3 
dx t() = [ ( Axt ) + AEx( ) t + å B u t i i( ) + v t( )]dt i=1 
+ (( Lx t) + LExt ( )) dw t N () + ( ( xt xt ) + NE ( )) dp t ( ) (15.43) 
[ , ] , T Ex = [, .5]T x0 = 20 15 0 23 14 5 
where the system state x t() x t( ), ( x t) denotes the share price of frms 1 and 2. The 
mean term Ex( )t denotes the average effect of collective prediction on the market share. 
The term ( ( ) + L ( )) wt 
= [ 1 2 ]
T 
Lx t Ex td ( ) can be regarded as the continuous intrinsic fuctuation 
due to random incidents like persistently fuctuating unemployment in the market share. 
The term ( ( Nx t ) + N Ex( td )) p t( ) can be regarded as discontinuous intrinsic fuctuation 
due to abrupt events like a change of tax rate in the market share. The trajectories of 
the Wiener process and the Poisson counting process are shown in Figure 15.1. The 
external disturbance vector v t() = 0 01. [n t( ), n t( )]
T
 denotes the effect of environmental 1 2 
events like economic recession and recovery, and n t( ) represents white Gaussian noise. k

The objectives of the frms and the government are to control the share price to 
track their desired trajectories. The desired trajectory is represented by x t( ), gener- ri 
ated by the following reference model:

In Figure 15.2, the desired transient and steady state trajectories of player 1, player 
2, and player 3 in (15.44) are presented. Players 1 and 2 both want to increase their 
own share price but for their share price to be higher than each other’s, and player 3 
wants players 1 and 2 both to have the same share price. 
For the MFSJD fnancial system in (15.43), suppose the noncooperative minimax 
H∞ tracking game strategy design u t( ) is selected by player i with a parsimonious i 
effort to minimize the worst-case effect of other competitive strategies to control the 
share price. The payoff function of the noncooperative minimax H∞ tracking game 
strategy is given in (15.9) with the weighting matrices as follows: 
1 (, . , , . ,, . ), 1 Q = diag 101101101 R = diag(01101 . , , . ,) 1
2 g 01101101 1 Q = 2 dia ( . , , . ,, . , ), R = diag( , 101101 ., ,. ) (15.45)

FIGURE 15.2 The desired trajectories x t( ) of each player in the noncooperative H∞ track￾ing game in the MFSJD fnancial system. ri 
where the diagonal weightings in Qi and Ri
 mean the punishment on the corre￾sponding tracking error and cost of the ith strategy, respectively. If a weighting in 
Qi increases, the punishment on the corresponding tracking error increases, and vice 
versa. If a weighting in Ri decreases, the punishment on the corresponding cost of 
the ith strategy decreases, and vice versa. The players have to trade off between the 
tracking error and the cost of a control effort. In general, a high weighting in Qi and 
a low weighting in Ri will lead player i to a lower tracking error but higher control 
effort. In this noncooperative H∞ tracking game strategy, two frms pay most of their 
funds to focus on their own share price, and the government is fair with both frms. 
By setting the search range 0 £ gi £ 100,i = 1,...,3, the population number 
N = 1500, the iteration number N = 300, the crossover rate C = 0 9. , and the muta- p I r 
tion rate mr = 0 1. , the MOP in (15.25) can be solved via the proposed reverse-order 
LMI-constrained MOEA. Once the iteration number NI = 300 is achieved, all the 
Nash equilibrium solutions are on the Pareto front in Figure 15.3. Then, we select * * * ( , ggg,) = ( . 2 2212 ,. ,. 109 2 028) at the knee solution as preferable solution. Under 1 2 3 
the concept of Pareto optimality, there are many solutions in a multi-objective prob￾lem, and it is diffcult to pick the best solution among these Pareto optimal solu￾tions. Within the Pareto optimal solutions of the MOP, the knee solution is a solution 
that has balanced performance on each objective. Further, the corresponding Pareto * -1 T * optimal strategy U t() = -R B P X ( )t in (15.19) of the MOP in (15.25) can be i i i i

to zero. This means that the share price decreases with no investment from the frms 
and the government.

From the steady states of the reference model in (15.46), it is obvious that these 
players have less suppression on their competitive players than in (15.44). The tra￾jectories of the MFSJD system of the market share by the noncooperative minimax 
H∞ tracking game strategy are shown in Figure 15.7. It can be seen that the players 
still cannot achieve their desired goals, but the share prices of their frms are closer to 
their desired trajectories compared to the noncooperative minimax H∞ tracking game

(2) Cooperative H∞ Reference Tracking Game Strategy: 
Consider the same MFSJD fnancial system in the previous three-player 
noncooperative game. Suppose frms 1 and 2 and the government are able 
to communicate with each other, and they had compromised with a com￾mon reference target before the design of the cooperative minimax H∞ 
tracking game strategy. Firms 1 and 2 will have the same share price, and 
the three players will collaborate with each other to reach the common 
reference target. Since we consider the cooperative minimax H∞ reference 
tracking game on the same MFSJD fnancial resource allocation system in 
market share, the MFSJD system of market share in (15.43) is modifed as 
follows. 
dx t() = [ ( Axt ) + AEx( ) t + But ( ) + vt ( )]dt 
+ ( ( Lx t ) + LEx( t))dw t() (15.47)
+ ( ( Nx t ) + NEx( t d )) p t() 
T ]
T x = [ , 20 15], Ex0 = [ 3 14 5 0 23,. 
The objective of the two frms and the government is to control the share price to 
track the common trajectory x t( ), which is generated by the following reference r 
model: 
dx ( )t = (A x t( ) + r t( ))dt r r r 
é150ù (15.48) 
xr ( ) 0 = x( ) 0 , , ( At r ) = -I r 2 () t = ê ú ë û 150 
The payoff function of the cooperative H∞ tracking game strategy is given in (15.29), 
and the weighting matrices are given as Q I = 6, R I = 12 . 
Compared to the noncooperative minimax H∞ tracking game, all players choose 
the same Q and R because these players will collaborate with each other to increase 
the share of both frms to the same price. We obtain the optimal solution g0 = 2 0506 . 
from the SOP in (15.40)–(15.42). The corresponding trajectory of the MFSJD system 
in market share by the proposed cooperative minimax H∞ tracking game strategy 
ut ∞ tracking game strategy 0
( ) is given in Figure 15.8. The cooperative minimax H 
u t 0
( ) of the MFSJD system of market share is shown in Figure 15.9. 
It can be seen that the share prices of both frms in the cooperative minimax H∞ 
tracking game strategy are higher than those in the noncooperative minimax H∞ 
tracking game strategy. The control effort of the cooperative minimax H∞ tracking 
game strategy in Figure 15.9 is apparently less than that of the noncooperative min￾imax H∞ tracking game strategy in Figure 15.6. This means if players collaborate 
with each other, they will gain more proft with less control effort. However, how 
to compromise on a common reference target is a complicated and time-consuming 
process because some players need to suffer a loss to achieve a compromise on a 
common target. 410 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

15.6.1.1 Non-Cooperative Minmax H∞ Tracking Game Strategy 
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the rapid growth of the internet has changed 
the world and has dramatically revolutionized many different felds. However, cyber 
attacks on networks and platforms also invade our privacy, destroy our properties,  
Multi-Player Noncooperative and Cooperative Game Strategies 411 
and even put our lives in danger. Therefore, network security has become an active 
research feld [458, 459]. In the real world, systems like networks and platforms 
often suffer external disturbances and continuous and discontinuous parameter fuc￾tuations due to attacks by hackers, the persistent interference of computer worms, 
or sudden slowdowns of the computers in the network. In a noncooperative game 
strategy, users attack each other to beneft. Individual users can invest money, time, 
or human resources in their own computer security like anti-virus software or attacks 
on specifc users like denial-of-service attacks. In this noncooperative game strategy, 
we assume fve users are attacking each other to steal each others’ properties and 
protecting their properties. If the security level increases, the properties will be more 
safe. The MFSJD system of network security is given as follows [460]:

persistent signal interference inside the network. The term (( Nx t ) + N Ex( td )) p t() 
can be regarded as the discontinuous intrinsic change due to abrupt computer 
slowdown events. The Wiener process and the Poisson counting process in the net￾work security system are given in Figure 15.10. The external disturbance vector

Multi-Player Noncooperative and Cooperative Game Strategies 413 
The desired security levels generated by the reference model in (15.50) selected 
by these players are shown in Figure 15.11. In the noncooperative minmax H∞ track￾ing game strategy, each player is an attacker and defender at the same time, so they 
will try to decrease competitive players’ security levels and achieve their desired 
security levels. 
For the MFSJD network security system, the noncooperative minmax H∞ tracking 
game strategy design could be seen as the Pareto optimal strategy u t i 
* ( ) to reach 
the desired security level despite the worst-case effect of competitive strategy and

By solving the MOP in (15.25) subject to (15.23) and (15.24) via the proposed 
LMI-constrained MOEA, we get the Nash equilibrium solutions for the noncooper￾ative minmax H∞ tracking strategy of the MFSJD network security system. We set 
the search range 0 £ gi £ 100,i = 1,...,5, the population number Np = 6000, iteration 
number N = 600, crossover rate C = 0 9. , and mutation rate m = 0 1. . Once the iter- i r r * * * * * * ation number N = 600 is achieved, we get ( gggg ,,, , ) g , P , the noncooperative i 1 2 3 4 5

to a low security level and suffer from continuous and discontinuous random fuc￾tuations. Figure 15.13 shows the security levels of the MFSJD network security

15.6.1.2 Cooperative Minmax H∞ Tracking Game Strategy 
Consider the cooperative minmax H∞ tracking game strategy with the same MFSJD 
network security (15.49). Users may cooperate with each other to protect the net￾work. The users are interdependent, so if an individual user’s security level increases, 
the other players will also beneft. If an individual user’s security level decreases, 
the probability of other players being infected with a virus will increase. However, 
individual users may tend to shirk from their duties of maintaining the security level,

which results in vulnerability of the network. To secure the basic level of network 
security, we assume the users in the network communicate with each other at frst 
to reach a compromise on the security level; then they are obligated to protect the

network system. In this situation, the MFSJD network security system in (15.49) is 
modifed as follows: 
dx() t = [ ( Axt ) + AEx(t) + Bu t( ) + v t( )]dt
+ ( ( Lx t ) ( + LEx t dw )) (t )( + N xt () + NExt ( ))( dp t ) (15.53)

All users with the cooperative minmax H∞ tracking game strategy are defending 
each other, so they want to have the same security level. For the MFSJD network 
security system, the cooperative minmax H∞ tracking game strategy design could 
be seen as the optimal strategy u t( ) to reach the same security level despite exter￾nal disturbance and continuous and discontinuous intrinsic fuctuations. The payoff 
function of the cooperative H∞ tracking game strategy is given in (15.29) with the 
weighting matrices as QI = 15 , R I = 50 . 
We solve the optimal solution ( ) 0 = 2.8674 g ∞for the cooperative minmax H 
tracking game from the LMI-constrained SOP in (15.40). Figure 15.16 shows the 
security levels of the MFSJD network security system by the cooperative min￾max H∞ tracking game strategy Ut ∞ tracking game 0
( ). The cooperative minmax H 
strategy U t 0 ( ) employed by players is shown in Figure 15.17. Similar to the pre￾vious example, the cooperative H∞ tracking game can have a higher security level 
with less control effort. This means the users in the network can be safer with less 
investment. 418 Multi-Objective Optimization System Designs and Applications

Multi-Player Noncooperative and Cooperative Game Strategies 419 
15.7 CONCLUSION 
This chapter has investigated multi-player stochastic noncooperative minimax H∞ 
tracking games with a partially conficting target strategy and cooperative minimax 
H∞ tracking game with a common target strategy in MFSJD systems with exter￾nal disturbance. With the proposed indirect method, the multi-player noncooper￾ative and cooperative minimax H∞ tracking game strategy design problems in the 
MFSJD system can be transformed into an equivalent LMI-constrained MOP and 
SOP for the MFSJD system, respectively. To effciently search the Pareto optimal 
solutions of the LMI-constrained MOP for all the Nash equilibrium solutions of the 
multi-player noncooperative H∞ tracking game, the LMI-constrained MOEA is also 
proposed. From the simulation results of two cyber-social systems, the proposed 
Pareto optimal solution is effective, and all players in the minimax H∞ noncooper￾ative and cooperative tracking games have a reasonable result. In the future, due to 
the large number agents in cyber-social systems, the behavior of large cyber-social 
systems can be described as a mean-feld system and should be considered in the 
system design of the individual agent. From a practical point of view, the proposed 
stochastic mean-feld system can be used to describe a more realistic cyber-social 
system with a large population (agents), such as a power grid system, autonomous 
vehicle network system, and so on. Meanwhile, the proposed noncooperative and 
cooperative tracking strategy design can be directly applied to the investment and 
management of these realistic large-scale cyber-social systems. Future research will 
focus on the mean-feld game-based control strategy design for these large-scale 
cyber-social systems. 
15.8 APPENDIX 
15.8.1 Proof of Theorem 15.2 
Because of the variation subsystem x t ˇ( ) in (15.3) and the tracking error dynamic e t i() 
of the mean subsystem in (15.5), the Lyapunov energy function of the augmented 
linear MFSJD system in (15.7) is united by energy functions of three subsystems T T T T as L X t = x ( )t P x t + i () 2 () + xr tP () = X t i ( ) i ( ( )) ( ) where P > 0, i ˇ 1 ˇ() e t P e t i () 3 x t r PX t 1 i i 
P2 > 0, and P > 0 = ia (, 2 , ). 3 are positive-defnite symmetric matrices and Pd g P1 P P3 
Then, from (15.15), the function J Ui( (t U), -i t i ( )) can be rewritten as follows: 
J U( (tU ), ( )t ) i i -i
