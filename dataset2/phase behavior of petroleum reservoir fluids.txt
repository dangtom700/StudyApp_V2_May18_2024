Phase Behavior of Petroleum 
Reservoir Fluids
Developed in conjunction with several oil companies using experimental data for real reservoir 
fluids, Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids introduces industry standard methods for 
modeling the phase behavior of petroleum reservoir fluids at different stages in the process. Keeping 
mathematics to a minimum, this book discusses sampling, characterization, compositional analyses, 
and equations of state used to simulate various pressure–volume–temperature (PVT) properties of 
reservoir fluids. The Third Edition has been updated throughout.

Preface
New data and new models have become available since the previous edition of this book and contrib￾ute to an ever-improving understanding of the phase behavior of oil and gas mixtures. In that light, it 
is noteworthy that the van der Waals equation of state presented in 1873, with minor modifications, 
remains the standard in the petroleum industry for describing the properties and phase behavior of 
oils and gases. The equation expresses that the phase behavior in the entire gas and liquid range is 
determined by the location of the critical points of the individual components. Also, for a multicom￾ponent reservoir fluid, the location of the critical point greatly influences the phase behavior of the 
fluid far away from the critical point. It is described in this edition how this observation can be used 
to simplify the determination of the optimum equation of state parameters. When the focus is on 
specific components or mixtures, other equations may be more accurate. The Span–Wagner equa￾tion was developed for pure carbon dioxide and the GERG-2008 equation for natural gas mixtures. 
For mixtures with aqueous components, the CPA equation is a good alternative to the non-classical 
mixing rules that have long been used to handle mixtures of water and hydrocarbon fluids.
The composition varies with the depth of a petroleum reservoir through the influence of gravity 
and a vertical temperature gradient. A recent observation is that for heavy oils, there is an additional 
contribution from viscosity.
Asphaltene precipitation from reservoir fluids has until recently not been fully understood, but 
thanks to extensive data for asphaltene precipitation from live oils becoming available, it has been 
possible to establish that an asphaltene phase can be described as a heavy liquid phase using a cubic 
equation of state. This has enabled the development of algorithms for the determination of a com￾plete asphaltene phase diagram.
Wax data and modeling have long focused on the wax appearance point. Equally interesting is 
the amount of wax precipitated at lower temperatures, especially from live oils. We are pleased to be 
able to present that kind of data and would like to extend special thanks to Equinor for making such 
data available and for many years of fruitful collaboration with the authors of this book.
We are grateful for the many exciting tasks within phase equilibria we have had the opportunity 
to solve in collaboration with people in the oil industry, which have given substance and inspiration 
to this Third Edition of Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids.

Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
1.1 RESERVOIR FLUID CONSTITUENTS
Petroleum reservoir fluids are multicomponent mixtures consisting primarily of hydrocarbons. 
Methane (CH4) is the simplest of all hydrocarbons and also the most common component in petro￾leum reservoir fluids. Because methane contains one carbon atom, it is often referred to as C1. 
Similarly, the term C2 is used for ethane (C2H6), C3 for propane (C3H8), and so on. Hydrocarbons 
with seven and more carbon atoms are called C7+ components, and the entity of all C7+ components 
is called the C7+ fraction. Petroleum reservoir fluids may contain hydrocarbons as heavy as C200. A 
particular C7+ component will belong to one of the following component classes:
Paraffins: A paraffinic compound consists of hydrocarbon segments of the type C, CH, CH2, 
or CH3. The carbon atoms are connected by single bonds. Paraffins are divided into normal 
paraffins (n-paraffins) and iso-paraffins (i-paraffins). In an n-paraffin, the carbon atoms 
form straight chains, whereas an i-paraffin contains at least one side chain. Paraffins are 
sometimes also referred to as alkanes. Figure 1.1 shows the structure of methane (C1), eth￾ane (C2), and n-hexane (nC6), which are all examples of paraffinic compounds.
Naphthenes: These compounds are similar to paraffins in the sense that they are built of the 
same types of hydrocarbon segments, but they differ from paraffins in that they contain 
one or more cyclic structures. The segments in the ring structures (e.g., CH2) are con￾nected by single bonds. Most naphthenic ring structures contain six carbon atoms, but 
naphthenic compounds with either five or seven carbon atoms connected in ring structures 
are also common in petroleum reservoir fluids. Naphthenes are also called cycloalkanes. 
Cyclohexane and methyl cyclopentane shown in Figure 1.1 are examples of naphthenic 
components.
Aromatics: Similar to naphthenes, aromatics contain one or more cyclic structures, but the 
carbon atoms in an aromatic compound are connected by aromatic double bonds. Benzene 
(C6H6), the simplest aromatic component, is shown in Figure 1.1. Polycyclic aromatic com￾pounds with two or more ring structures are also found in petroleum reservoir fluids. An 
example of the latter type of components is naphthalene (C10H8), whose structure is also 
shown in Figure 1.1.
The percentage of paraffinic (P), naphthenic (N), and aromatic (A) components in a reservoir 
fluid is often referred to as the PNA distribution.
Petroleum reservoir fluids may also contain inorganic compounds, of which nitrogen (N2), car￾bon dioxide (CO2), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are the most common. Water (H2O) is another impor￾tant constituent of reservoir fluids. As water has limited miscibility with hydrocarbons and a higher 
density, most of the water in a reservoir is usually found in a separate water zone located beneath 
the gas and oil zones.
1.2 PROPERTIES OF RESERVOIR FLUID CONSTITUENTS
Table 1.1 shows selected physical properties of some constituents found in naturally occurring oil 
and gas mixtures. By comparing, for example, the normal boiling points, it is evident that hydro￾carbons in petroleum reservoir fluids cover a wide range of component properties. At atmospheric 
pressure, pure methane will be in gaseous form at temperatures above the normal boiling point of 
12 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
−161.6°C, whereas at the same pressure the temperature must be raised to 218.0°C before naph￾thalene evaporates. The properties of hydrocarbons with the same number of carbon atoms may 
also differ substantially. n-hexane (nC6), methyl cyclopentane (m-cC5), and benzene all contain six 
carbon atoms. However, the properties of these three components are quite different. For example, 
it can be seen in Table 1.1 that the density of nC6 at atmospheric conditions is lower than that of 
m-cC5, which component has a lower density than that of benzene. This suggests that densities of 
components with the same carbon number will increase in the order P → N → A. It is rare to see a 
measured PNA distribution, and, in the absence of experimental information about the predominant 
molecular structures, the trend in component densities may be used to give an idea about the distri￾bution of P, N, and A components in a given C7+ fraction.
The pure component vapor pressures and critical points (CPs) are essential in calculations of 
component and mixture properties. The pure component vapor pressures are experimentally deter￾mined by measuring the corresponding values of temperature (T) and pressure (P) at which the 
substance undergoes a transition from liquid to gas. Figure 1.2 shows the vapor pressure curves of 
methane and benzene, both of which are common constituents of oil and gas mixtures. The vapor 
pressure curve ends at the CP, above which no liquid-to-gas phase transition can take place. The CP 
of methane is −82.6°C and 46.0 bar and that of benzene 289°C and 48.9 bar. The temperature at CP 
is called TC and the pressure PC.
As illustrated in the right-hand-side plot in Figure 1.3, the phase behavior of a pure component 
at a given temperature, T1, may be studied by placing a fixed amount of this component in a cell 
at temperature T1. The cell volume may be varied by moving the piston up and down. At position 
A, the cell contents are in the gaseous state. If the piston is moved downward, the volume will 
decrease, and the pressure increases. At position B, a liquid phase starts to form. By moving the 
piston further downward, the volume will further decrease, but the pressure remains constant 
until all gas is converted into liquid. This happens at position C. A further decrease in the cell 
volume will result in a rapidly increasing pressure. The left-hand-side curve in Figure 1.3 illus￾trates the phase changes when crossing a vapor pressure curve. A pure component can only exist 
in the form of two phases in equilibrium right at the vapor pressure curve. When the vapor pres￾sure curve is reached, a conversion from either gas to liquid or liquid to gas will start. This phase

transition is associated with volumetric changes at constant T and P. At the point B, the compo￾nent is said to be at its dew point or in the form of a saturated gas. At position C, the component 
is at its bubble point or in the form of a saturated liquid. At position A, the state is undersaturated 
gas, and at D, it is undersaturated liquid.
Another important property is the acentric factor, ω, as defined by Pitzer (1955):

where Psat stands for vapor pressure (or saturation pressure). The idea behind this definition is 
outlined in Figure 1.4. A plot of the logarithm of the reduced pure component vapor pressure, 
P P r P sat sat = c / , against the reciprocal of the reduced temperature, Tr
 = T/Tc, will for most pure sub￾stances give an approximately straight line. Figure 1.4 shows plots of log10 Pr
sat versus 1/Tr
 for argon 
(Ar) and n-decane (nC10). For Tr
 = 0.7 (1/Tr
 = 1.43), log10 Pr
sat = −1.0 for argon and −1.489 for nC10. 
Argon is used as a reference and assigned an acentric factor of 0. In general, the acentric factor of 
a component equals the difference between ( ) . log Pr
sat
Tr 10 =0 7 for argon and for the actual substance. 
With this definition, the acentric factor of nC10 equals [−1 − (−1.489)] = 0.489, which is consistent 
with the acentric factor given for nC10 in Table 1.1.
The acentric factor got its name because the acentric factor of n-paraffins increases with 
carbon number. Methane (C1) has an acentric factor of 0.008, ethane (C2) 0.098, propane (C3) 
0.152, and so on. With increasing carbon number, molecules of this component class get more 
elongated (less spherical). More fundamentally, the acentric factor can be seen as a measure of 
the curvature of the pure component vapor pressure curve. Figure 1.5 shows the vapor pressure 
curves of three hypothetical substances, all having the same critical temperature and pressure 
as nC10 (344.5°C and 21.1 bar), whereas the acentric factors are 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0, respectively 
(the acentric factor of nC10 is 0.489). With the CP locked, the vapor pressure curves are bound 
to end at the same point, whereas the bend on the curve is determined by the acentric factor. 
For an acentric factor of 1.0, the vapor pressure curve is relatively flat at low temperatures 
and then increases steeply when approaching the critical temperature. If the acentric factor 
is lower, a more even increase is seen in vapor pressure with temperature. The vapor pressure 
curves in Figure 1.5 have been calculated using the Peng–Robinson equation of state presented 
in Chapter 4.

1.3 PHASE ENVELOPES
Petroleum reservoir fluids are multicomponent mixtures; therefore, it is of much interest to find a 
mixture equivalent of the pure component vapor pressure curve. With two or more components 
present, the two-phase region is not restricted to a single line in a PT diagram. As is illustrated in 
Figure 1.2 for a mixture of 25 mol% methane and 75 mol% benzene, the two-phase region for a 
mixture forms a closed area in P and T. The line surrounding this area is called the phase envelope.
Figure 1.6 shows the phase envelope for a natural gas mixture with the composition given in 
Table 1.2. The phase envelope consists of a dew point branch and a bubble point branch meeting at 
the CP of the mixture. On the dew point branch, the mixture is in gaseous form and in equilibrium 
with an incipient amount of liquid. Under these conditions, the gas (or vapor) is said to be saturated. 6 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

At higher temperatures and the same pressure, there is no liquid present. By contrast, the gas may 
take up liquid components without liquid precipitation taking place. The gas is therefore said to be 
undersaturated. On the bubble point branch, the mixture is in liquid form and in equilibrium with an 
incipient amount of gas, and the liquid is said to be saturated. At lower temperatures and the same 
pressure, the liquid (or oil) is undersaturated. At the CP, two identical phases are in equilibrium, 
both having a composition equal to the overall composition. At temperatures close to the critical 
temperature and pressures above the critical pressure, there is only one phase present, but it can be 
difficult to tell whether it is a gas or a liquid. The term super-critical fluid is often used. Phase iden￾tification in the super-critical region is discussed in more detail in Chapter 6. The highest pressure at 
which two phases can exist is called the cricondenbar, and the highest temperature with two phases 
present is called the cricondentherm.
The phenomenon called retrograde condensation is illustrated in Figure 1.6 as a dashed vertical 
line at T = −30°C. At this temperature, the mixture is in gaseous form at pressures above the upper Petroleum Reservoir Fluids 7
dew point pressure, that is, at pressures above approximately 75 bar. At lower pressures, the mixture 
will split into two phases, a gas and a liquid. Liquid formation taking place as the result of falling 
pressure is called retrograde condensation. If the pressure at a constant temperature is decreased to 
below the lower dew point pressure of approximately 15 bar, the liquid phase will disappear, and the 
entire mixture will be in gaseous form again.
1.4 CLASSIFICATION OF PETROLEUM RESERVOIR FLUIDS
Petroleum reservoir fluids may be divided into:
Natural gas mixtures
Gas condensate mixtures
Near-critical mixtures or volatile oils
Black oils
Heavy oils
Tables 1.2–1.7 give examples of each of these fluid types. The various fluid types are distin￾guished by the position of the mixture’s critical temperature relative to the reservoir temperature.

FIGURE 1.7 Phase envelopes of various types of reservoir fluids. The molar compositions are shown in Table 
1.2 (natural gas), Table 1.3 (gas condensate), Table 1.4 (near-critical fluid), and Table 1.5 (black oil). The phase 
envelopes have been calculated using the Peng–Robinson equation of state presented in Chapter 4. The reser￾voir fluid compositions have been characterized using the procedure of Pedersen et al. presented in Chapter 5.
This is illustrated in Figure 1.7. During production of oil and gas from a reservoir, the tempera￾ture remains approximately constant at the initial reservoir temperature, Tres, whereas the pressure 
decreases as material is removed from the reservoir. For a natural gas, this pressure decrease will 
have no impact on the number of phases. The gas will remain single phase at all pressures. For a 
gas condensate, a decreasing pressure will, at some stage, lead to the formation of a second phase. 
This happens when the pressure reaches the dew point branch at temperature Tres. The second phase 
formed will be a liquid phase with a higher density than that of the original phase.Petroleum Reservoir Fluids 11
For a near-critical mixture, a pressure decrease will also, at some stage, lead to the formation of 
a second phase. If the reservoir temperature is Tres, as shown in Figure 1.7, the second phase will be 
a gas phase, because the point at which the phase envelope is reached is located at the bubble point 
branch. Such a mixture is classified as a volatile oil. If the reservoir temperature is slightly higher, as 
indicated by T′
res in Figure 1.7, the entry into the two-phase region will take place in the dew point 
branch, and the mixture is classified as a gas condensate. Near-critical reservoir fluids are mixtures 
with critical temperatures close to the reservoir temperature. Inside the phase envelope, the compo￾sitions and properties of the gas and liquid phases are similar.
Finally, for black oils and heavy oils, entry into the two-phase region at the reservoir temperature 
will always take place at the bubble point branch, and, accordingly, the new phase formed is a gas.
Figure 1.8 shows a close-up of the near-critical region of a Chinese reservoir fluid (Yang et al. 
1997), whose composition is given in Table 1.6. The liquid volume percentages plotted in Figure 1.8

liquid change rapidly with pressure and temperature in the vicinity of the CP. For example, at a tem￾perature of around 100°C, only a marginal change in pressure is needed to change the liquid-phase 
amount from 50 vol% to 100 vol%.
The heavy oil in Table 1.7 is an example of a biodegraded oil. It lacks C5–C6 components and 
has low contents of C7–~C15 components. Microorganisms have broken down the n-paraffins in that 
carbon number range. Figure 1.9 shows the simulated phase envelope of the heavy oil in Table 1.7. 
Because of the relatively low content of gaseous components, the bubble point pressures are rela￾tively low. The high C7+ molecular weight signals a significant concentration of C100+ components, 
which makes the dew point temperatures higher than those of the black oil, as can be seen by com￾paring with Figure 1.7. Biodegraded oils are further dealt with in Section 5.7.1.
1.5 SHALE FLUIDS
Shale oil and gas are hydrocarbon reservoir fluids found trapped within shale formations. Oil 
shale has been known for centuries and has in the United States since the early twentieth century 
occasionally been mentioned as a potential additional energy resource. Extensive development 
of shale fluids started in the United States around 2000 and has since then increased almost 
exponentially. Shale fluids belong to the group of unconventional resources, but not because 
they chemically deviate from other petroleum reservoir fluids. They differ by being contained 
in very tight formations, so unconventional production strategies, including fracking, must be 
applied. Getting a representative sample is a challenge, and the produced fluid will often be 
depleted because of the pressure drop (draw down) in the near-well bore area. Major shale reser￾voirs in North America are Eagle Ford in Texas and Bakken in Montana and North Dakota and 
spreading into Canada. Other shale reservoirs that could potentially be recovered are located 
in Russia, China, Argentina, Libya, and Australia. Table 1.9 shows a shale gas condensate fluid 
from Argentina.

Sampling, Quality Control, 
and Compositional Analyses
The quality of an experimental pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) study depends heavily on the 
quality of the samples collected from the field. A PVT study will only reflect the reservoir fluid if 
performed on fluid samples that are representative of the fluid at down-hole conditions. Figure 2.1
shows the workflow from the time a fluid sample is taken until an equation of state (EoS) model is 
developed, which matches the observed fluid behavior and can be used as input to compositional 
reservoir, process, and flow simulations.
2.1 FLUID SAMPLING
To collect representative samples, the flow into the well must be single phase. That will only be 
the case if the saturation pressure of the reservoir fluid is lower than the reservoir pressure. It must 
further be taken into consideration that the bottom hole flowing pressure (BHFP) will in general be 
lower than the reservoir pressure. It is therefore a further requirement that the saturation pressure be 
lower than the BHFP at which the sample was taken.
The samples can be

Bottom hole sampling (subsurface) is well suited for undersaturated oil reservoirs, that is, oil 
reservoirs with a reservoir pressure exceeding the saturation pressure. A bottom hole sample is 
taken by lowering a single-phase sampler into the well using wire line technology, as sketched in 
Figure 2.2, and making sure the samples are captured at the desired depth. Subsurface sampling is 
appropriate for black oils, volatile oils, and dry gases. Because the samples are taken at or close to 
the reservoir pressure, it is the preferred technique for samples to undergo an asphaltene study. At 
a lower sampling pressure, asphaltenes might precipitate, and that would cause irreversible damage 
of the samples.
For gas condensate fluids, a bottom hole sample may be “contaminated” by liquid dropping 
out higher up in the well where the pressure is lower and the fluid has split into two phases. It is 
therefore advisable for gas condensate type of fluids to carry out surface or separator sampling. As 
illustrated in Figure 2.3, the reservoir fluid is let through a separator operating at a particular tem￾perature and pressure. Separator oil and gas are sampled at the same time. This pair of separator 
samples is then recombined to the producing gas/oil ratio (GOR) to give a representative reservoir 
FIGURE 2.2 Bottom hole sampling technique. A single-phase sample cylinder is lowered into the well using 
wire line technology.
FIGURE 2.3 Separator sampling. Samples are taken at the gas and liquid outlets.16 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
fluid composition. Separator sampling is applicable for black oils, volatile oils, gas condensates, wet 
gases, and dry gases.
Separator sampling is further recommended for reservoirs that have been in production long 
enough to have the reservoir pressure drop to below the saturation pressure of the original reservoir 
fluid (depleted reservoirs). For such reservoirs, bottom hole sampling is unlikely to provide a repre￾sentative sample.
Wellhead sampling, as sketched in Figure 2.4, is the preferred method for any fluid that is single 
phase at the wellhead conditions. When that condition is fulfilled, wellhead sampling is a very reli￾able and cost-effective method of sampling.
No matter which sampling technique is used, it is important to condition the well properly. Well 
conditioning has the purpose of cleaning the well and reducing the pressure drop (drawdown) from 
the reservoir to the wellbore to a minimum. The area with a pressure drop is called the drainage 
area and is illustrated in Figure 2.5. Omitting well conditioning can result in two-phase flow in the 
FIGURE 2.4 Wellhead sampling. A single-phase sample is taken at wellhead conditions.

wellbore or near the perforations. The fluid entering into the wellbore will in that case be different 
from the original reservoir fluid in the reservoir outside the drainage area. Well conditioning is par￾ticularly important when the reservoir pressure is approaching the saturation pressure.
If bottom hole samples are to be collected, well conditioning is to be performed as follows:
Start off with a high flow rate to clean up the well. This will almost certainly increase the 
drainage area, and free gas will form.
To afterwards reduce the drainage area, flow the fluid at the lowest possible flow rate for about 
4 days.
Shut in the well for a period of 1 week to force the released gas into solution in the oil, thus 
raising the saturation pressure and obtaining a representative fluid in the wellbore.
Before collecting separator samples, it is important to measure the gas and liquid flow rates con￾tinuously. The flow rate should be stable and as low as possible.
2.2 QUALITY CONTROL OF FLUID SAMPLES
The compositional analyses and fluid studies are carried out by a PVT laboratory, which will ini￾tially perform a sample validation (quality control) to check whether the samples represent the res￾ervoir fluid. The actual validation process depends on whether bottom hole, wellhead, or separator 
samples have been collected.
For all types of samples, the sample chamber is initially heated to approximately 90°C to redis￾solve any wax that may have precipitated during sampling or shipping.
2.2.1 Bottom Hole/Wellhead Samples
The quality control of a bottom hole oil sample is carried out as follows:
The preferred type of chamber to collect bottom hole and wellhead samples has a mechanism 
for retaining the pressure high enough to also keep the fluid single phase at temperatures 
lower than the reservoir temperature. At the PVT laboratory, the opening pressure of the 
sample cylinder at ambient temperature is recorded. As schematically shown in Figure 2.6, 
this can be done by attaching a pressure gauge to the bottom of the chamber and then open￾ing the bottom valve of the chamber to record the pressure. The opening pressure must 
comply with the shutting pressure at the sample site.
To detect whether the sample contains water, approximately 5 ml of sample is removed from 
each side. If water comes out, the fluid displacement is continued until reservoir fluid 
comes out.
Approximately 10 ml of sample is displaced and released to atmospheric conditions. The den￾sities of different flashed oil samples are compared to check for consistency. The density 
may possibly also be compared to the density of oil samples from neighboring wells. A 
sample of a higher density than other samples from the same field could be contaminated 
by water.
An initial gas chromatographic (GC) analysis is carried out to check whether the fluid sample 
is contaminated by base oil from drilling mud. This analysis is called a fingerprint analy￾sis. The purpose is not to determine the fluid composition but to look for peaks in the 
chromatogram originating from oil contained in drilling mud. If a sample of the drilling 
fluid exists, the chromatogram of the reservoir fluid sample may be compared with that 
of the drilling fluid. Any similarity in peaks may indicate that the sample is contami￾nated. Section 2.4.1 has more on GC analyses and Section 2.7 more on mud-contaminated 
samples.18 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
A partial constant composition expansion (CCE) test is performed to determine the satura￾tion pressure of the fluid at the reservoir temperature. This test is performed by charging 
approximately 50 ml of sample to a high-pressure PVT cell. After stabilization at the res￾ervoir temperature, the sample pressure is reduced until the saturation pressure is observed 
either visually or as a sharp change in the slope of the pressure–volume (PV) curve. CCE 
experiments are further dealt with in Section 3.1.1. The saturation pressure may be known 
from other sources or from other bottom hole samples taken from the same reservoir. If the 
saturation point of the actual sample deviates significantly from the established saturation 
point, the sample quality may be questionable.
The sample is flashed to atmospheric pressure and 15°C. The volumes of the flashed gas and 
residual liquid are measured. The residual liquid is also called stock tank oil (STO). The 
GOR at atmospheric conditions is called the single-stage GOR. The ratio of the oil volume 
at reservoir and atmospheric conditions is called shrinkage. The measured GOR, shrink￾age, and STO density should be consistent between samples and agree reasonably with 
data for neighboring fields. The compositions of the evolved gas and liquid are analyzed 
using GC (see Section 2.4.1) and checked for impurities from atmospheric air.
2.2.2 Separator Samples
A separator sample consists of an oil and a gas sample taken from a separator, both at the same time. 
The process the separator sample undergoes from field to compositional analysis in the PVT labora￾tory is shown schematically in Figure 2.7. The samples must be collected at equilibrium conditions

at which the separator gas is at its dew point and the separator oil at its bubble point. As illustrated 
in Figure 2.8, this means that the phase envelopes of the separator gas and liquid will intersect at 
the separator conditions.
2.2.2.1 Quality Control of Separator Gas
Figure 2.9 shows how a separator gas is quality controlled (QCed).
The laboratory will measure the opening pressure to see whether it complies with the shutting 
pressure at the field. Because the sample cylinder is opened at a lower temperature than 
the separator temperature, the opening pressure will be lower than the shutting pressure. 20 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
A quantitative check of compliance between the shutting and opening pressure can be 
performed using a PVT simulation package. A pressure–temperature (PT) flash calcula￾tion at separator conditions will give the molar volume of the fluid in the sample chamber. 
The opening pressure can be found by a volume–temperature (VT) flash for the laboratory 
temperature. Flash calculations are further dealt with in Chapter 6.
If heated to above the separator temperature, the separator gas sample is not to contain any 
liquid. This is checked by heating the gas cylinder to a temperature at least 10°C above the 
separator temperature. If the cylinder contains any liquid at these conditions, it suggests 
either liquid carryover from the separator liquid or that the sampling temperature was 
incorrect. It could also be that the cylinder was not cleaned before taking the sample. Such 
a sample must be discarded.
If the separator gas passes the quality check, its composition is measured using GC, as further 
described in Section 2.4.1.
2.2.2.2 QC of Separator Liquid
A separator liquid is QCed as shown in Figure 2.10.
At the laboratory, it is checked whether the opening pressure complies with the shutting pres￾sure at the field. This can be done by subsequent PT and VT flash calculations, as for a 
separator gas.

The separator liquid cylinder is heated to least 10°C above the separator temperature. To 
detect whether the sample contains water, approximately 5 ml of sample is removed. If 
water comes out, the fluid displacement is continued until reservoir fluid starts coming out. 
If the water content is more than 10%, the fluid sample is discarded.
The separator liquid should be at its bubble point at the separator temperature. The bub￾ble point is determined by a partial CCE test (not shown in Figure 2.10) carried out 
at separator temperature. The partial CCE is performed as for a bottom hole sample 
(Section 2.2.1).
The sample is flashed to atmospheric pressure and 15°C. The volumes of the flashed gas and 
residual liquid (STO) are measured. The compositions of the evolved gas and liquid are 
analyzed using GC (see Section 2.4.1).
When the reservoir fluid composition is established, it is possible to carry out a PT flash 
calculation at separator conditions using a PVT simulation package. The gas and oil com￾positions from the flash should ideally be identical to those of the sampled separator gas 
and liquid. It is often found to be more convenient to compare the K-factors than phase 
compositions. The K-factor of component i is the ratio of the mole fraction of component 
i in the separator gas (yi
) and the mole fraction of component i in the separator liquid (xi
). 
A plot of the simulated K-factors against the experimental ones should give a straight line 
expressed as y = x. An example of such a plot is shown in Figure 2.11.

2.3 HOFFMANN PLOT
The Hoffmann plot (Hoffmann et al. 1953) is much used in oil industry as a method to validate 
whether gas and liquid separator samples are in equilibrium at separator conditions. As outlined in 
the following, the Hoffmann plot is based on simple and approximate correlations that are otherwise 
no longer used in the oil industry.
Table 2.1 shows the composition of a volatile oil reservoir fluid obtained by recombing the shown 
gas and liquid compositions from a separator operating at 69 bar and 65°C. The recombined reser￾voir fluid composition will only be representative of the reservoir fluid if the separator gas and sepa￾rator liquid compositions are in thermodynamic equilibrium at separator conditions. The Hoffmann 
plot is intended to clarify whether that is the case.

not completely fulfilled in Figure 2.12.

This is a special case of the Hoffmann relation, where the straight line assumed in the Hoffmann 
method follows the equation y = x. The right-hand side is independent of pressure, and a pressure 
correction is needed to arrive at the final Hoffmann relation.
Poynting (1905) introduced a pressure correction through what he called a modified saturation

Several questionable approximations have been made, which makes the Hoffmann relation 
uncertain:
• The pure component vapor pressure does not in general follow the simplified Antoine 
equation.
• A separator gas is not an ideal gas.
• A separator oil is not an ideal mixture.
• The Poynting correction is an approximation and component dependent.
At first glance, the Hoffmann plot in Figure 2.12 might give the impression that the assumed 
linear relationship is close to being fulfilled, but this is not the case. Table 2.2 shows the composi￾tion of the sampled separator gas and of the gas composition according to the Hoffman relation; 
that is, Table 2.2 shows what the plot would look like if all the dots in Figure 2.12 had been on the 
dashed line. The concentrations of the gas components according to the Hoffmann relation deviate 
significantly from the measured ones.

The Hoffmann method was good practice at a time when computers and cubic equations of 
state had not yet made their way into oil industry. Cubic equations were known at the time (1953) 
Hoffmann et al. presented their method, but phase equilibrium calculations using cubic equations 
were out of reach until computers in the 1970s became a widely used engineering tool in the oil 
industry.
With a cubic equation, it is straightforward to perform a PT flash calculation of the recombined 
reservoir fluid composition at separator conditions and compare the simulated K-factors with those 
derived from the sampled separator compositions. A plot of experimental K-factors versus simu￾lated K-factors should give a straight line with y = x, as illustrated in Figure 2.11. As illustrated 
in Figure 2.8, the phase envelopes of the separator gas and separator liquid are to intersect at the 
separator P and T, which can be used as a further quality check.
2.4 COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSES
Oil and gas condensate mixtures consist of thousands of different components, which makes it 
almost impossible to carry out a complete component analysis. Instead, components heavier than 
nC5 are grouped into boiling point fractions, often referred to as carbon number fractions. Table 2.3
shows the boiling point temperatures separating the carbon number fractions (Katz and Firoozabadi 
1978). The cut points are determined from the boiling points (TB) of n-paraffins. The C7 fraction, 
for example, consists of the hydrocarbons with a boiling point from 0.5°C above TB of nC6 to 0.5°C 
above TB of nC7. The C8 fraction consists of the hydrocarbons with a boiling point from 0.5°C 
above TB of nC7 to 0.5°C above TB of nC8, and so on. Table 2.3 also shows generalized densities and 
molecular weights of each carbon number fraction up to C45. These are based on a US study about 
gas condensate mixtures by Bergman et al. (1975).
Two standard analytical techniques are used in compositional analyses:
Gas chromatography (GC)
True boiling point (TBP) analysis or carbon number distillation
2.4.1 Gas Chromatography
2.4.1.1 Preparation of Oil Mixtures
The gas and liquid phases to be analyzed using GC are prepared using a spike flash technique. A 
spike flash apparatus is shown schematically in Figure 2.13 and consists of an oven with a flask 
inside where the reservoir fluid is flashed to atmospheric pressure and approximately 49°C (120°F). 
This will separate the single-phase fluid into a gas and an oil phase. The spike flash can also be 
performed at ambient temperature, but the oil phase is easier to handle if the separation takes place 
at an elevated temperature. The evolved gas resulting from the flash is collected in a coiled metal 
tube, which is placed in an oven at approximately 65°C (~150°F). A gas meter is attached to this 
coil, and the volume of gas collected is noted. The residual liquid from the flask and the evolved gas 
are analyzed separately.
2.4.1.2 Preparation of Gas Condensate Mixtures
Cryogenic distillation is an appropriate technique for preparing gas condensate samples for chro￾matographic analyses. It has an advantage over the spike flash technique because it requires less 
sample volume. The operating principle is sketched in Figure 2.14. A sub-sample of single phase 
reservoir fluid is pumped into a glass receiver, which is submerged in liquid nitrogen. Because of 
the low temperature, the entire sample will condense. This liquid phase is then allowed to warm to 
ambient temperature, and the evolved gas is collected into a cylinder also held in liquid nitrogen. 
This process is continued until the temperature is just above ambient temperature. The gas and liq￾uid separated in this manner are analyzed separately.Sampling, Quality Control, and Compositional Analyses 27

2.4.1.3 Gas Chromatograph
A gas chromatograph (GC) can be used to analyze gas and liquid compositions. A GC consists of 
an injector, a column, and a detector. A typical GC is sketched in Figure 2.15.
2.4.1.3.1 Injector
A subsample of either a gas or a liquid is injected into the column of the GC. A valve system is used 
for gases and a syringe for liquids.
2.4.1.3.2 Column
The column of a GC contains a stationary phase over which a carrier gas is continuously moving 
to effect separation. If the fluid is liquid, a capillary column is used, which is made of fused silica 
bonded with a liquid phase. If the fluid is a gas, three different sequential columns are used with 
different packing—one made of a porous polymer, the next one with a molecular sieve, and finally 
one with a liquid phase (capillary). The GC utilizes three columns to clearly identify all eluted 
components.
2.4.1.3.3 Detector
Once the separation of components is done in the column, the carrier gas flows into the detector, 
which produces an electrical signal proportional to the weight concentration of each component in 
the sample. For liquid chromatograms, a flame ionization detector is used, whereas for gas samples, 
a thermal conductivity detector is used along with the flame ionization detector.
Because each component in the sample elutes at a particular temperature, the sample injector, 
column, and detectors are enclosed in a temperature-controlled environment (oven).
2.4.1.3.4 GC Analyses
A GC analysis provides a weight percent composition. Table 2.4 shows an example of the composi￾tions of a gas and a liquid from a flash of a reservoir fluid to standard conditions and of the recom￾bined reservoir fluid composition (Sah et al. 2011). The components between C6 and C7 are called C7
isomers, those between C7 and C8 are C8 isomers, and those between C8 and C9 are C9 isomers. Some

components, for example, benzene, are not classified according to their carbon number. A benzene 
molecule contains six carbon atoms, but because the boiling point of benzene is in the C7 cut (see 
Tables 1.1 and 2.3), benzene is classified as a C7 component. From C10 to C35, all components are 
lumped into carbon number fractions according to the boiling ranges in Table 2.3. The last fraction 
is C36+ and contains C36 and heavier components.
The C7+ isomers are also called BTEX components. While it can be desirable to have these com￾ponents quantified in process simulations, they provide an unnecessary overhead in compositional 
reservoir simulations. Prior to assigning equation of state model parameters to a reservoir fluid to 
be used in compositional reservoir simulation studies, the C7+ isomers will be combined with the 
respective carbon number fraction, as shown in the last two columns of Table 2.4. Table 2.5 shows 
a typical GC analysis as reported from a commercial PVT laboratory. It has most, but not all, com￾ponents identified to C9 and a single defined C10 component.

GC is a non-preparative technique, which does not allow the molecular weights of individual 
carbon number fractions to be quantitatively determined. Because in general no component iden￾tification takes place for the fractions above C9, the GC technique provides no information about 
molecular weights of the heavier fractions. For C10–C35, the molecular weights in Table 2.3 are gen￾erally accepted. The PVT laboratory will measure the average molecular weight, Moil, of the stable 
oil from the flash to atmospheric pressure (Figures 2.13 and 2.14). The molecular weight, M+, of a

where ρoil is the density of the stable oil, and ρi
 is the liquid density of component (or carbon

which are gaseous at standard conditions (see Section 2.5). When a C36+ density is reported for a 
GC composition, the densities assumed for C7–C35 are in most cases those in Table 2.3. This is 
unfortunate, as the actual densities of the C7–C35 fractions in most reservoir fluids are higher than 
those in Table 2.3. Assuming C7–C35 densities that are too low will result in a too high C36+ density 
being reported.
Table 2.6 shows the composition to C12+ of a heavy gas condensate with relatively high concen￾trations of CO2 and H2S (Takeshi et al. 2020). A fluid with high concentrations of CO2 and H2S is 
called an acid fluid.
High-temperature capillary GC is a technique permitting compositional analyses of oil samples 
to around C80+ (Curvers and van den Engel 1989). Table 2.7 shows a composition to C80+ analyzed 
by this technique.

Often the same GC column is used to perform consecutive GC analyses for black oils and gas con￾densates. Black oils have a large concentration of C30+ components, and part of the C30+ fraction may

“get delayed” in the column and not reported for the oil. Mawlod et al. (2021) have reported such 
case in a Round Robin study, and Stephen et al. (2008) have reported similar issues. If the same col￾umn is subsequently used to analyze a gas condensate, the delayed C30+ fraction from the previous 
black oil analysis might come out and be reported as belonging to the gas condensate. Too high a 
C30+ concentration will in such case be reported for the gas condensate. To the extent possible, dif￾ferent GC columns should be used for analyses of black oils and gas condensates, or the GC column 
should be thoroughly cleaned between a black oil and a gas condensate analysis.
2.4.2 TBP Analysis
A TBP analysis separates the components of a stable oil into boiling point cuts. A TBP distilla￾tion column is sketched in Figure 2.16. The cut points are given in Table 2.3. Each distillation 
cut contains sufficient material to measure the density and molecular weight. Because there is 
a limited span in molecular weight within a carbon number fraction, its molecular weight can 
be measured with a higher accuracy than the average molecular weight of the oil sample as a 
whole. An example of data from a TBP analysis is given in Table 2.8. Up to C10+, the distillation 
has been carried out at atmospheric pressure. From C10 to C19, the pressure was 26.6 mbar and, 
finally, the fractions C20–C29 were separated at a pressure of 2.66 mbar. The pressure is reduced 
to avoid decomposition (cracking). Even though the distillation of C10 and heavier fractions 
takes place at a reduced pressure, it is still customary to report the boiling point temperature at 
atmospheric pressure (second column of Table 2.8). The densities in Table 2.8 are at atmospheric 
pressure (1.01 bar) and 15°C. Figure 2.17 shows the percentage of weight distilled off as a func￾tion of temperature.
2.4.2.1 Molecular Weight from Freezing Point Depression
Appendix A introduces the phase equilibrium criterion between gas and liquid. At equilibrium, 
component i will have the same fugacity in the vapor phase and in the liquid phase. Similarly, at 
equilibrium between a liquid phase and a solid phase, component i will have the same fugacity in 
the liquid phase (l) as in the solid phase (s):

The mole fraction of benzene in the benzene–oil solution can be found by using the depressed 
freezing point of benzene (T) in Equation 2.22. The molar fraction of oil in solution equals (1 − xi
). 
With the molar amount of benzene known, the molar amount of oil is also known. The average 
molecular weight of the oil can therefore be found as the ratio of the weight and molar amounts of 
oil in solution.
The uncertainty on the molecular weight of the individual carbon number fractions is around 2%, 
whereas it is around 5% for a C20+ fraction. The uncertainty on the molecular weight of a stable oil 
from a flash of a bottom hole sample to standard conditions will be at least 10%.
2.5 RESERVOIR FLUID COMPOSITION FROM BOTTOM HOLE SAMPLE
This section details the steps required to generate a compositional analysis of a bottom hole sample. 
The composition considered ends at C10+, but the same principle will apply for a composition to a 
higher carbon number.
Consider a bottom hole sample taken at 104°C and 340 bar, at which conditions the sample vol￾ume is 1 l (= 1000 cm3
). In the laboratory, the sample is flashed to standard conditions (1.01 bar and 
15°C), giving a liquid of the volume 0.462 l and a gas of the volume 175.2 l. The density of the oil at 
standard conditions is 0.836 g/cm3, and it has an average molecular weight of 187.1.
A GC analysis to C10+ is carried out for the oil sample giving the composition in Table 2.9. The 
composition is measured as a weight composition. The weight fraction (w) of each component con￾tained in the fractions from C7 to C9 is determined, and the C10+ molecular weight is calculated from 
Equation 2.16. Moil is the average molecular weight of the oil sample, which is 187.1. Similarly, the 
density of the C10+ fraction is calculated from Equation 2.17, where the overall density of the oil, 
ρoil, at standard conditions equals 0.836 g/cm3. The densities of the components N2, CO2, and C1–C6
in Table 2.9 are the pure component densities recommended by the American Petroleum Institute 
(1982) for use in calculations of densities of oil mixtures at standard conditions. The densities of 
C7–C10 are at 1.01 bar and 15°C. The molar composition is calculated using Equation 2.15.
The number of moles contained in the oil at standard conditions is calculated:

All components present in significant amounts are identified, permitting calculation of the average 
molecular weights of each of the fractions C7, C8, C9, and C10+. The average molecular weight of the

The total number of moles in the bottom hole sample is then:

 the

2.6 RESERVOIR FLUID COMPOSITION FROM SEPARATOR SAMPLES
Consider a gas and a liquid sample taken from a separator operating at 70 bar and 50°C. The GOR 
equals 215.2 Sm3/m3. It is defined as the volume of gas from the separator after a flash to standard 
conditions divided by volume of oil at separator conditions. In the laboratory, the separator gas and 
the separator oil are flashed to standard conditions. Usually, a small amount of liquid is formed 
when flashing the gas to standard conditions, but this is neglected in the following calculation. This 
gives three compositions to analyze:
Gas from the flash of separator gas to standard conditions
Gas from the flash of separator oil to standard conditions
Oil from the flash of separator oil to standard conditions

Each composition is analyzed separately. Table 2.12 shows the various gas and oil volumes, 
Table 2.13 the composition of separator gas, and Table 2.14 the composition of gas from the flash of 
separator oil to standard conditions.
The density of oil at standard conditions is 0.825 g/cm3. A GC analysis to C10+ is carried out for 
the oil sample from the flash of separator oil to standard conditions, resulting in the composition 
shown in Table 2.15. The densities of the components N2, CO2, and C1–C6 are the pure component 
densities from Table 2.9. The densities of C7–C10 are at 1.01 bar and 15°C. The molecular weight and 
density of the C10+ fraction are calculated from Equations 2.16 and 2.17, respectively.
Furthermore, a true boiling point analysis is carried out for the oil from the flash of separator oil 
to standard conditions. The resulting composition is seen in Table 2.16. The compositions in Tables 
2.15 and 2.16 are combined (<C5 from Table 2.15 and C5+ from Table 2.16) to give the oil composi￾tion shown in Table 2.17. The mole percentages in the last column are calculated from Equation 
2.15. The average molecular weight of the oil is 176.6.

2.7 MUD-CONTAMINATED SAMPLES
Bottom hole samples collected in wellbore systems using oil-based muds (OBMs) are likely to be 
contaminated by medium to heavy hydrocarbon fractions present in the OBM (Gozalpour et al. 
2002). The OBM generally consists of components in the range C8–C34 and is dominated by the 
paraffinic C11–C18 components.
A plot of ln(mol%) versus carbon number for the fractions C7–C35 will for a clean reservoir fluid 
show an approximately straight line, as is further dealt with in Chapter 5. For a contaminated fluid, 
such a plot will, as sketched in Figure 2.18, show two or three peaks originating from the dominant 
OBM components.
PVT laboratories will usually report the OBM concentration as the weight percent contained in 
the oil from a flash of the reservoir fluid to standard conditions. Otherwise, the content of OBM 
may either be estimated by removing the material above the straight line in a plot of ln(mol%) ver￾sus carbon number. For the fluid in Figure 2.18, that would mean removing the material above the 
straight line.
It is of course preferable to have clean samples. However, when only contaminated samples exist, 
the operator must get the best out of them. PVT measurements, presented in Chapter 3, are used 
to get data for the behavior of a reservoir fluid. If the fluid sampled is contaminated, the PVT data 
measured will be for the contaminated sample and the measured PVT properties may deviate sub￾stantially from those of the clean reservoir fluid. Figure 2.19 shows how OBM will affect the phase 
envelope of reservoir fluids. The OBM will lower the saturation pressure of an oil mixture, whereas 
it will increase the saturation pressure of a gas condensate fluid.
To get a true picture of the reservoir fluid in a field from which only a mud-contaminated sample 
exists, the contaminated reservoir fluid composition must be numerically cleaned. In general, it is 
impossible to validate whether the cleaned fluid matches the uncontaminated reservoir fluid, but 
Sah et al. (2012) have presented a paper allowing numerical cleaning methods to be tested. A clean 
reservoir sample was intentionally contaminated by OBM. Table 2.20 shows the composition of the 
clean reservoir fluid and of the reservoir fluid with 21 weight% contaminate of the STO oil. Also

shown in Table 2.20 is the composition of the OBM. It contains components from C8 to C34 and is 
dominated by C11–C14. It can be seen that the densities of all OBM carbon number fractions are 
lower than of the corresponding carbon number fractions in the clean reservoir fluid. The OBM 
is dominated by n-paraffins, which have lower densities than the corresponding naphthenic and 
aromatic components present in the reservoir fluid. The numerical cleaning must therefore not only 
correct the component mol% for the presence of OBM but also correct the densities of the contami￾nated fractions for the influence of OBM.
Table 2.21 outlines the procedure used by Sah et al. to numerically clean the contaminated res￾ervoir fluid composition in Table 2.20 for mud contaminate. An almost perfect correspondence was 
seen with the clean reservoir fluid composition also shown in Table 2.20.48 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

PVT Experiments
To optimize production from oil and gas fields, it is essential to have extensive knowledge of the 
volumetric and phase changes the reservoir fluid will undergo on its way from petroleum reservoir 
to oil refinery. Reservoir pressures typically range from 100 to 2000 bar and reservoir temperatures 
from 25°C to 200°C. The well connecting the reservoir to the topside facilities can have a length of 
several kilometers. The pressure and temperature will gradually decrease in the production well, in 
flow lines connecting the well to the process plant, and in the process plant itself. Figure 3.1 illus￾trates schematically the production path of a reservoir fluid.
The conditions in the reservoir will also change during production. A reservoir fluid which in the 
exploration phase was either single-phase gas or single-phase oil may after some time of produc￾tion split into two phases. The phase split is the result of material being removed from the reservoir. 
With more space available for the remaining reservoir fluid, the pressure will decrease and may 
after some time reach the saturation pressure, at which a second phase (gas or oil) will start to form.
PVT properties is the general term used to express the volumetric (V) behavior of a reservoir 
fluid as a function of pressure (P) and temperature (T). An essential PVT property is the saturation 
pressure at the reservoir temperature. From the time the reservoir pressure reaches the saturation 
pressure, and a second phase starts forming, the composition of the produced well stream will 
change because the production comes primarily from either the gas or the liquid zone.
It is customary to use the volumes of oil and gas at atmospheric pressure and 15°C as reference 
values. Atmospheric pressure (1 atm or 1.01325 bar) and 15°C are referred to as standard conditions. 
At standard conditions, a gas will behave approximately like an ideal gas, for which the ideal gas 
law applies:
PV
RT = 1 (3.1)

FIGURE 3.1 Production path of a reservoir fluids.52 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
P stands for pressure, V for molar volume, T for temperature, and R is the gas constant. Any devia￾tion from ideal gas behavior may be expressed through the compressibility factor, Z:
Z PV
RT = (3.2)
For an ideal gas, Z equals 1.0. For a nonideal gas or a liquid, Z may attain values below or 
above 1.
The gas dissolved in an oil at reservoir conditions will start evaporating once the saturation pres￾sure is reached. The oil at standard conditions has little content of gas. The loss of gas components 
makes the oil volume decrease. It seems that the oil shrinks during production.
The volumetric changes taking place in the reservoir, during passage of the well and in the 
process plant, can be studied by performing PVT experiments on the reservoir fluid. This chapter 
describes the most commonly performed PVT experiments. Table 3.1 gives an overview of some 
important PVT properties measured in PVT experiments, all of which are described in more detail 
in the following. Pedersen et al. (1989) and Shaikh and Sah (2011) have given further descriptions 
of PVT experiments.
It is customary to distinguish between routine and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) PVT experi￾ments. The routine PVT experiments emulate the processes taking place in a reservoir that is 
produced through natural depletion, also called primary recovery. As long as the reservoir pres￾sure is higher than the saturation pressure, the fluid is produced in single phase. Pressure will 
drop as a result of the produced fluid being removed from the reservoir. When the pressure goes

below the saturation pressure, the fluid will split into two phases, a gas and a liquid. Due to its 
lower viscosity, the lighter gas phase will in most cases be produced faster than the liquid. If the 
natural depletion process is continued, the total recovery is likely to be low as a significant frac￾tion of the heavier components is left behind in the reservoir. Various techniques exist for EOR, 
one being gas injection. Gas is injected to maintain the reservoir pressure above the saturation 
pressure. The aim is to continue producing a single-phase fluid with a high concentration of 
heavier components.
PVT experiments are heavily dependent on the availability of PVT cells that can provide accu￾rate volumetric information at the relevant pressure and temperature conditions. It is also important 
to be aware how much sample volume is required to perform a PVT study. Table 3.2 provides key 
data for PVT cells in common use by PVT laboratories.
A PVT experiment is started by filling the cell with the pressurizing medium (often water) at the 
temperature and initial pressure of the experiment. The cell is connected to a calibrated pump. The 
sample is introduced in the cell displacing the pressurizing medium. The volume of displaced fluid 
is recorded, whose volume equals the initial cell fluid volume.
3.1 ROUTINE PVT EXPERIMENTS
As can be seen in Table 3.3, the routine PVT experiments to be performed depend on the fluid type. 
Around 600 cc of sample volume at reservoir conditions is required to conduct a routine PVT study. 
Figure 3.2 shows the workflow of a routine PVT study for an oil and a gas condensate mixture.

3.1.1 Constant Mass Expansion Experiment
The constant mass expansion (CME) experiment is also referred to as a constant composition expan￾sion (CCE) or simply as a pressure-volume (PV) test. The CME experiment is performed to inves￾tigate the PV relationship of the reservoir fluid. Irrespective of fluid type, it is common practice to 
at least carry out a CME test at the reservoir temperature. One or two additional CME experiments 
may be carried out at a lower temperature.
3.1.1.1 Oil Mixtures
The CME experiment for an oil mixture is sketched in Figure 3.3. A known volume of single-phase 
sample is charged to a PVT cell and heated to the experimental temperature. At this temperature, 
the fluid is stabilized at single phase conditions at a pressure above the reservoir pressure. Once the 
sample is stable, the volume is noted. The sample is expanded to increase the volume of the fluid, 
which will make the pressure decrease. At a predefined pressure, the sample is stabilized and the

above the reservoir pressure down to an abandonment pressure. The saturation pressure is visually 
observed. For an oil mixture the saturation point is a bubble point. The term Vsat is used for the satu￾ration point volume. At each stage of the experiment, the relative volume is recorded, defined as the 
ratio between the actual volume (Vtot) and the volume at the saturation pressure:

The Y-factor is a measure of the ratio between the relative changes in pressure and total volume 
in the two-phase region. As gas takes up more volume than liquid, the volumetric changes with 
decreasing pressure will be larger in the two-phase region than in the single-phase region. An oil 
that releases much gas with decreasing pressure will have a small Y-factor, whereas an oil that only 
releases small amounts of gas with decreasing pressure will have a large Y-factor.
A CME experiment is usually stopped at a pressure somewhere in the interval from 50 to 100 
bar.
Table 3.4 shows the primary results from a CME experiment performed on an oil mixture. 
Table 3.5 shows CME results for the oil composition in Table 3.6. The Y-factor and relative volume 
results are plotted in Figure 3.4.
The reservoir fluid density is measured at a single-phase pressure. It can be at the reservoir pres￾sure or any other pressure above the saturation pressure. Fluid is pumped into a pre-weighed vessel 
of a known volume and the weight increase is measured at the relevant pressure and temperature. 
The single-phase density is the ratio of mass and volume. The densities at other pressures down to 
the saturation pressure are calculated using this (reference) density and the relative oil volume data.

At this temperature, the fluid is stabilized at a pressure above the reservoir pressure and saturation 
pressure. A CCE is performed as explained earlier for oil mixtures to a final pressure of around 50 
bar. The dew point pressure is visually measured. The relative volume as defined in Equation 3.3 is 
reported at all pressures. The gas phase compressibility factor as defined in Equation 3.2 is recorded 
for pressures above the saturation pressure. Below the saturation pressure, the liquid volume as a

3.1.1.3 Dry Gases
Dry gases will not have a saturation point at the typical reservoir temperature. It is therefore not 
possible to conduct a full CME study on a dry gas. Instead, a PVTZ study is performed, which 
reports gas Z-factors at the relevant temperature and decreasing pressures. For a gas to be used as 
injection gas for EOR purposes, the temperature will most often be equal to the reservoir tempera￾ture. A pressure interval around the reservoir pressure will be covered. The compressibility factors 
of the gas are determined by initially measuring the volume (Vref) of a given amount of gas at the 
temperature in question (Tref) and the highest pressure (Pref) to be considered (reference conditions). 
The gas is flashed to atmospheric (standard) conditions and the gas volume recorded. Assuming that 
the Z-factor is 1.0 at atmospheric conditions, the number of moles of gas, n, contained in the total 
volume at standard conditions (Vstd) can be determined using a slightly rewritten Equation 3.1:
n
P V
RT
std std
std = (3.7)
The same number of moles will be contained in the total volume (Vref) at the reference pressure 
and temperature. That allows the Z-factor (Zref) at reference conditions to be determined from:
Z P V T
P V T
ref
ref ref std
std std ref = (3.8)
The same equation may be used to calculate the Z-factor at other pressures and temperatures for 
which the total volume of the same molar amount of gas has been measured.
Any deviation from 1.0 of the Z-factor at atmospheric conditions will transfer into the Z-factors 
at elevated pressure and temperature. If, for example, the gas Z-factor at standard conditions is not 
1.0 but only 0.99, the reported gas Z-factor at reservoir conditions will be 1% too low.
Table 3.10 shows the composition of a dry gas for which gas Z-factors at 155°C are shown in 
Table 3.11.
Measurements of gas Z-factors are further dealt with in Section 3.1.7.
3.1.2 Differential Liberation Experiment
The differential liberation (DL) experiment is sketched in Figure 3.7. It is also known as a differen￾tial vaporization or differential depletion experiment and is performed on black oil reservoir fluids

and volatile oils. The DL experiment emulates the compositional and volumetric changes that occur 
in oil reservoirs during production.
The experiment is started by transferring reservoir fluid to a cell kept at a fixed temperature, 
most often the reservoir temperature, and a pressure above the reservoir pressure. The DL cell is 
equipped with a valve on top allowing gas to be depleted (removed) during the experiment. The 
experiment is started at the saturation pressure.
The sample is equilibrated at the first selected pressure below the saturation pressure. The 
evolved gas is pumped out of the cell at constant pressure and its volume and composition measured 
at standard conditions. The pressure is further reduced, the evolved gas taken off, and so on in typi￾cally six pressure stages between saturation and atmospheric pressure.
Figure 3.8 illustrates a DL experiment in a pressure–temperature diagram.

FIGURE 3.7 Schematic representation of a differential depletion experiment.62 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
A differential depletion experiment is usually continued down to atmospheric pressure before cool￾ing off the cell to the standard temperature of 15°C. The volume of the cell content at atmospheric 
(standard) conditions is reported as the residual (or standard) oil volume, Vstd
oil
. The liquid volumes at 
the remaining pressure stages are reported relative to the residual oil volume through the oil formation 
volume or shrinkage factor, Bo. If the oil volume at stage N is VN
oil
, Bo is for stage N defined as:
B (N) V
V o
N
oil
std
oil = (3.9)
The oil at standard conditions is often referred to as stable oil to indicate that it can be trans￾ported at standard conditions without further release of gas. The Bo-factor defined in Equation 3.9 
is a measure of how much the oil would shrink during production. Assume an oil has a Bo-factor 
of Bo,x at a reservoir pressure of Px and that it takes up a volume of VOLx at Px. The oil volume 
will at atmospheric conditions have shrunk to VOLx/Bo,x. The oil shrinks because it releases gas 
when the pressure decreases and because of thermal contraction with decreasing temperature. The 
SI unit for Bo is m3/Sm3, where Sm3 indicates that the residual oil volume is in m3 and at standard 
conditions.
The solution gas/oil ratio (GOR), RS, is another important quantity measured in a DL experi￾ment. The gas/oil ratio of the oil at a given stage in a DL experiment is calculated by adding the 
standard volumes of the gas liberated in each of the subsequent stages and then dividing this sum 
of gas volumes by the residual oil volume. For the oil at stage N in a DL experiment with a total of 
NST pressure stages, RS is given by Pressure

The standard volumes of gas are determined by flashing the gas liberated at each stage to stan￾dard conditions. That will cause a small volume of liquid to drop out. The molar volume of the liq￾uid can be determined as the ratio of density and molecular weight. The molar amount, n, is the ratio 
between the actual liquid volume and the molar volume. This volume is converted to an equivalent 
gas volume by solving Equation 3.7 for Vstd. That volume is added to the gas volume entering into 
Equation 3.10.
The volume of the liberated gas is measured at both cell conditions and at standard conditions. 
This enables calculation of the gas formation volume factor, Bg:
B Gas volume at cell conditions
Gas volume at standard conditions g = (3.11)
Cell conditions refer to the pressure and temperature in the cell at the pressure stage at which the 
gas was depleted. The SI unit for Bg is m3/Sm3. S stands for standard and indicates that the volume 
is reported at standard conditions.
The gas gravity is defined as the average molecular weight of the gas divided by the average 
molecular weight of atmospheric air:
Gas gravity Molecular weight of gas
Molecular weight of atmospheri = c air (3.12)
The molecular weight of atmospheric air is usually taken to be equal to 28.964 g/mol. By express￾ing the molecular weight relative to that of atmospheric air, the gas gravity becomes a measure of 
the low-pressure density of the liberated gas relative to that of atmospheric air.
Table 3.12 lists the primary results reported from a DL experiment.
The reservoir pressure will decrease during production. From the time the pressure reaches the 
saturation pressure, two phases will be present, an oil phase and a gas phase. Owing to continu￾ous liberation of gas, the amount of gas dissolved in the oil will decrease with decreasing pres￾sure. This will result in decreasing Bo-factors and solution gas/oil ratios with decreasing pressure. 
Figure 3.9 shows a plot of the Bo-factor of the oil in Table 3.6 against pressure. The results are 
tabulated in Table 3.13. It is seen that the Bo-factor increases with decreasing pressure above the

saturation point. This is because the oil expands with decreasing pressure until it starts releasing 
gas. Figure 3.10 shows a plot of RS towards pressure for the same oil. Above the saturation point, 
RS is constant because the composition of the produced reservoir fluid is constant until the satura￾tion point is reached. Below the saturation point, RS decreases with decreasing pressure. The gas 
liberated from the oil just below the saturation point primarily consists of lighter gas components.

As the pressure is further decreased, the content of heavier compounds in the gas will increase. 
This is reflected in an increasing gas gravity with decreasing pressure, as can be seen in Table 3.13.
3.1.3 Constant-Volume Depletion Experiment
The constant-volume depletion (CVD) experiment is performed on gas condensate and volatile oil 
mixtures. It is sketched for a gas condensate in Figure 3.11 and for a volatile oil in Figure 3.12.
The test consists of a series of volume expansions and constant pressure displacements of excess 
volume of gas to return the cell content to a constant volume. The constant volume is equal to the 
volume at the saturation pressure. This procedure is repeated for typically six stages down to the 
abandonment pressure of approximately 50 bar.
The cell is constructed in the same manner as for a CME experiment but is equipped with a valve 
on top allowing depletion of gas during the experiment. The experiment is started at the saturation 
point. The saturation point pressure, Psat, and the saturation point volume, Vsat, are recorded. The 
volume is increased, which will make the pressure decrease, and two separate phases form in the 
cell. The mixture volume is subsequently decreased to Vsat by letting out the excess gas through the 
valve on top, maintaining a constant pressure. The molar amount of gas depleted as a percentage of 
the gas initially in the cell and the liquid volume in the cell as a percentage of the saturation point 
volume are recorded. The volume is increased again, the excess volume is depleted, and so on until 
the pressure is somewhere between 100 and 40 bar.
The composition of each displaced gas can be determined using the techniques explained in 
Chapter 2. The number of moles of depleted gas is found as the ratio of mass depleted to molecu￾lar weight. The molar volume of the depleted gas at cell conditions equals the volume depleted 
divided by the number of moles. That allows the compressibility factor to be determined from 
Equation 3.2.
The liquid volume at each depletion pressure is measured and expressed as a percentage of the 
sample volume at the saturation pressure.
It is customary to also report the gas viscosity at cell conditions from a CVD experiment. Usually, 
the reported gas viscosities are not measured values but calculated from a correlation, often the one 
of Lee et al. (1966), which is further described in Chapter 10.
The primary results from a constant-volume depletion experiment are summarized in Table 3.14.

The constant-volume depletion experiment has been designed to gain knowledge about the 
changes with time in PVT properties and composition of the produced well streams from gas con￾densate and volatile oil reservoirs. The reservoir is seen as a tank of fixed volume and at a fixed 
temperature. During production the pressure decreases because material is removed from the field, 
whereas the volume and temperature remain (almost) constant. When the pressure reaches the satu￾ration point, the mixture splits into a gas and a liquid phase. If all the production comes from the 
gas zone, the mixture produced will have the same composition as the gas removed from the cell 
in a constant-volume depletion experiment. This gas will gradually become less enriched in heavy 
hydrocarbons, and less liquid will be produced from the topside separation plant.
The amount of reservoir fluid removed from the reservoir from the time the pressure is P1 until it 
has decreased to P2 corresponds to the amount of gas removed through the valve on top of the PVT 
cell in the depletion stage at pressure P2.
Table 3.15 shows the molar composition of a gas condensate mixture that has undergone a con￾stant volume depletion experiment at a temperature of 150.5 °C. The primary data from the CVD 
experiment is shown in Table 3.16. Table 3.17 shows the compositions of the depleted gas at the 
various pressure stages. The C7+ concentration is seen to decrease with decreasing pressure until the 
pressure is below 50 bar. The molecular weight of the C7+ fraction of the depleted gas decreases with 
decreasing pressure until the pressure is below 150 bar.

3.1.4 Separator Test
Separator experiments are carried out for both oil and gas condensate mixtures. A three-stage sepa￾rator test is sketched in Figure 3.13. The separator test is performed to measure the compositional 
and volumetric changes the fluid will undergo during production. The separator test conditions are 
often selected to correspond with those of the field separators.PVT Experiments 69

Experiment at 119.4 °C for the Volatile Oil in Table 3.18
The reservoir fluid is placed in a closed cell (a separator) at pressure and temperature conditions, 
at which the fluid mixture separates in a gas and a liquid phase. Once the two phases are in equilib￾rium, the gas is pumped out of the separator at the test conditions through the top and is transferred 
to standard conditions, where its volume, gas gravity, and composition are measured. As for the DL 
experiment, liquid dropping out from the gas is converted to an equivalent gas volume at standard 
conditions. The liquid from the first stage separator is subjected to a second stage separation at a 
lower pressure and temperature than the first one. More gas will be liberated. As for the first separa￾tor this gas is transferred to standard conditions and its properties measured. The oil from the last 
separator at standard conditions is called stock tank oil, and the volume of this oil is called stock 
tank oil volume. The term stock tank signals that the oil can be stored at atmospheric conditions 
without liberating gas. The stock tank oil is weighed and the density measured at 15°C to calculate 
the volume of stock tank liquid. The composition of the stock tank liquid is determined.
The purpose of a separator experiment is to get a rough idea about the relative volumetric 
amounts of gas and oil produced from a particular petroleum reservoir. Table 3.21 gives a summary 
of the results reported from a separator experiment.
Table 3.22 shows the results of a four-stage separator test on the oil composition in Table 3.23. 
The compositions of the gas liberated in each stage are shown in Table 3.24. The separator results in 
Table 3.22 also include a Bo-factor for the reservoir fluid at 199.7 bar (saturation point) and 97.8°C PVT Experiments 71

temperature to stable oil from a four-stage separation with separator temperatures and pressures 
as in Table 3.22. The remaining Bo-factors in Table 3.22 express the shrinkage of the oil from the 
current stage of the separation down to stock tank conditions. The separator gas/oil ratio equals the 
ratio between the volume of the gas liberated from the current stage taken to standard conditions

for a ball of a given weight and diameter to fall from the top to the bottom of a cell filled with the 
oil under investigation.
A newer and more accurate technique for determining viscosity is by electromagnetic viscom￾eter (EMV) as sketched in Figure 3.15. This instrument is based on the technique in which the 
magnetic force is applied to a piston immersed in the fluid under the test. The motion of the piston 
is resisted by a viscous drag of the fluid and provides the measure of viscosity. The EMV technique 
is applicable to both oil and gas viscosities. To measure gas viscosities, a piston is used with a hol￾low in the center and the chamber is placed horizontally. Most often gas viscosities reported along 
with oil viscosities are not measured, but found from a gas viscosity correlation, often the one of 
Lee et al. (1966) described in Chapter 10.
The approximate development in oil viscosity with pressure is sketched in Figure 3.16. Above 
the saturation pressure, the viscosity decreases with decreasing pressure due to the compressibility 
effect, which increases the distance between the molecules. The minimum viscosity is seen at the 
saturation pressure. Below the saturation point the viscosity increases with decreasing pressure. 
Lighter (gaseous) components are released and the viscosity becomes increasingly influenced by 
heavier components.
Experimental viscosity data is presented in Chapter 10.
3.1.6 Material Balance Tests
For the PVT experiments in which material is being removed, it is customary for PVT labs to 
perform a mass balance test to check whether the mass of the fluid charged to the cell equals the 
mass of the fluid removed from the cell plus the material left in the cell when the test is over. A 
such material balance test is outlined in the following for a differential liberation test as described 
in section 3.1.2.
A differential liberation test is started at the saturation point (stage NSAT) and continued for 
N stages at a constant temperature. The last stage is at atmospheric pressure after which the oil is 
cooled to standard temperature (15°C). In the following mass balance calculation, the reference is

3.1.7 Measurement of Gas Z-Factors
As mentioned in Section 3.1.1.3., PVT laboratories have the practice to assume that the Z-factor 
equals 1.0 for a gas at standard conditions. Table 3.30 shows Z-factors for some pure component 
gases at standard conditions (1.01325 bar and 15°C). For N2 and C1, a Z-factor of 1.0 at standard 
conditions is a good assumption. For the heavier gases, the Z-factors at standard conditions are more 
than 0.5% lower than 1.0. For gas mixtures with a considerable concentration of C2 and heavier, the 
Z-factors reported by PVT labs could therefore be slightly too high.
Accurate Z-factor measurements are conducted in a Burnett cell as sketched in Figure 3.17
(Burnett 1936 and Fredenslund et al. 1973). The cell consists of two thick-walled vessels of a vol￾ume of 125–275 cm3, connected to each other by means of an expansion valve. The Burnett cell 
is located in a thermostat and equipped with a pressure measuring system. Prior to the start of a 
Z-factor measurement, both vessels are evacuated. The valve between the two vessels is closed, 
and one is filled with the gas mixture to be studied. After isothermal conditions are obtained, the 
temperature and pressure are measured. The valve between the two vessels is opened, and the 
pressure and temperature are measured after stabilization. The valve between the two vessels is 
closed and one vessel evacuated. These expansions are continued until a low pressure is reached. 78 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids TABLE 3.27 Component Molar Balance for Differential Liberation Experiment in Tables 3.25 and 3.26 Component Moles In Liberated Gas 63.1 bar 49.3 bar 35.5 bar 21.7 bar 7.9 bar 1.01 bar STO Oil Moles Out Deviation Moles 0.00718100 0.00041400 0.00038400 0.00037700 0.00041400 0.00059500 0.00103200 0.00397800 0.00719400 −0.00001300 N2 0.00002449 0.00000985 0.00000664 0.00000418 0.00000236 0.00000095 0.00000010 0.00000000 0.00002410 0.00000039 CO2 0.00008495 0.00001374 0.00001352 0.00001421 0.00001648 0.00001894 0.00000557 0.00000000 0.00008247 0.00000248 H2S 0.00003167 0.00000269 0.00000361 0.00000407 0.00000493 0.00001382 0.00001166 0.00000000 0.00004078 −0.00000911 C1 0.00131391 0.00030581 0.00027395 0.00025092 0.00023967 0.00019163 0.00003375 0.00000000 0.00129572 0.00001819 C2 0.00030167 0.00003155 0.00003291 0.00003789 0.00005147 0.00008647 0.00004933 0.00000000 0.00028962 0.00001206 C3 0.00035043 0.00002091 0.00002246 0.00002741 0.00004145 0.00009837 0.00012713 0.00000278 0.00034052 0.00000991 iC4 0.00011016 0.00000447 0.00000476 0.00000596 0.00000923 0.00002578 0.00005489 0.00000438 0.00010947 0.00000069 nC4 0.00027396 0.00000907 0.00000975 0.00001214 0.00001909 0.00005651 0.00014839 0.00001949 0.00027445 −0.00000049 iC5 0.00016186 0.00000344 0.00000369 0.00000460 0.00000729 0.00002441 0.00009824 0.00003182 0.00017348 −0.00001162 nC5 0.00020925 0.00000389 0.00000415 0.00000516 0.00000803 0.00002763 0.00012311 0.00005052 0.00022249 −0.00001324 C6 0.00032918 0.00000356 0.00000396 0.00000490 0.00000733 0.00002668 0.00013580 0.00014798 0.00033021 −0.00000103 C7 0.00039574 0.00000273 0.00000269 0.00000328 0.00000451 0.00001620 0.00010701 0.00025937 0.00039578 −0.00000004 C8 0.00042346 0.00000145 0.00000134 0.00000158 0.00000174 0.00000625 0.00006965 0.00034529 0.00042731 −0.00000385 C9 0.00038325 0.00000058 0.00000046 0.00000049 0.00000037 0.00000119 0.00003447 0.00034171 0.00037927 0.00000398 C10+ 0.00278695 0.00000025 0.00000012 0.00000019 0.00000004 0.00000018 0.00003292 0.00277466 0.00280835 −0.00002140PVT Experiments 79

3.2.1 Solubility Swelling Test
Solubility swelling studies (or swelling experiments) are carried out on reservoir oil mixtures to 
study how the reservoir fluid will react to gas injection. In rare cases, swelling experiments are also 
performed on gas condensate mixtures. The saturation pressure of the reservoir fluid is determined 
by carrying out a CME experiment as described in Section 3.1.1. It is likely that a different fluid 
sample will be used to carry out the EOR PVT experiments than was used in the routine experi￾ments. An initial CME test on the sample to be used in the EOR experiments in such cases also 
serves as a quality check of consistency between fluid samples.
A PVTZ study as described in Section 3.1.1.3 is carried out on the injection gas. Using the 
experimentally determined Z-factor and Equation 3.2, it is straightforward to convert injection gas 
volumes to injection gas moles. A known molar amount of injection gas is transferred to the PVT 
cell. The pressure is increased to a pressure high enough to ensure all gas is dissolved in the oil 
(could be around 550 bar), and a CME experiment is caried out for the mixture of oil and gas. Some 
PVT labs will report the CME data, while others may only report the saturation pressure and the 
swelling volume at the saturation pressure. More gas is injected, and the new saturation pressure 
and swelling volume are recorded. This process is repeated for a number of stages, as sketched in 
Figure 3.19. At the last stage(s), the saturation point may have changed from a bubble point to a 
dew point, signaling that the fluid would be critical somewhere between the last bubble point and 
the first dew point. At the critical point, two identical fluid phases are in equilibrium. The critical 
composition and critical pressure are key parameters in gas injection EOR evaluations. This will 
be further dealt with in Chapter 15.
As can be seen in Table 3.33, the swelling experiment gives information on the volume increase 
(swelling behavior) as a result of a particular amount of gas dissolving in the oil. It further tells how 
much extra pressure is needed to dissolve the injected gas. The swelling gas/oil ratio is defined as 
the cumulative volume of the injection gas at standard conditions per initial oil volume. This is dif￾ferent from how the GOR is defined in other PVT experiments.
A separate study of the viscosity of swelled mixtures may be carried out.
Table 3.34 presents swelling data for the reservoir fluid composition in Table 3.35, which also 
shows the composition of the injection gas that contains 60.32 mol% CO2. The saturation point 
shifts from a bubble point to a dew point between 100 and 150 mol% gas added per initial mole oil.

Table 3.36 shows swelling data for the reservoir fluid composition and injection gas in Table 3.37. 
For this fluid, the shift from bubble point to dew point is observed in the interval between 225 and 
275 mol% gas added per initial mole oil.
Table 3.38 shows swelling data for the oil composition in Table 3.39 using the injection gas also 
shown in Table 3.39. Table 3.40 shows the liquid volume percentages below the saturation point in 
each of the four swelling stages. The liquid dropout curves are plotted in Figure 3.20. 
3.2.2 Equilibrium Contact Experiment
Although the swelling experiment provides information about the reservoir fluid when saturated 
with injection gas in various quantities, it does not provide any information about the phases in 
equilibrium below the saturation pressure. As is illustrated in Figure 3.21, the equilibrium contact 
experiment is designed to provide two-phase information on mixtures of reservoir oil and injection 
gas. It is customary that one of the gas-oil mixing ratios is close to the one for which the saturation 
point shifts from a bubble to a dew point in the swelling experiment. The mixed fluid composition 
will, in other words, be near critical at its saturation point.

A portion of the recombined reservoir fluid sample is charged to a high-pressure visual cell at a pres￾sure of around 550 bar and thermally expanded to the reservoir temperature. The Z-factor of the injection 
gas is known from a PVTZ study, as described in Section 3.1.1.3. Using this experimentally determined 
Z-factor, the volume of gas corresponding to a specified molar amount of gas is determined. After adding 
the gas, the cell content is pressurized to around 550 bar to dissolve all gas in the oil. The pressure is low￾ered to the first contact pressure and kept there for 24 hours to be sure phase equilibrium has established.
The gas phase is displaced (as in a differential liberation experiment) and the gas phase composi￾tion determined. The molecular weight of the gas phase can be derived from the composition.
A partial CCE experiment is performed on the liquid phase to confirm the saturation pressure 
used for the equilibrium contact phase separation. The density of the liquid phase is determined by 
pumping portions of the fluid under pressure from the cell at around 550 bar into a pre-weighed 
vessel. The density at the saturation pressure is then calculated using the measured relative volumes 
from the preceding partial CCE experiment.
The viscosity on the liquid phase is measured using one of the techniques described in Section 3.1.5.
The data reported from an equilibrium contact experiment is listed in Table 3.41.
Table 3.42 shows the results of an equilibrium contact experiment on the reservoir fluid and the 
injection gas in Table 3.37.

3.2.3 Multi-Contact Experiment
When gas is injected into a reservoir containing undersaturated oil, some of the gas will dissolve in 
the oil. If the oil phase cannot accommodate all the injected gas, the fluid will split into two equi￾librium phases, a gas and an oil. The composition of the gas phase will be different from that of the 
injection gas. The gas has taken up some components from the reservoir oil, and it has lost other 
components to the oil phase. The equilibrium gas will be pushed away from the injection well by 
new injection gas and will contact fresh oil in some distance from the injection well. The oil near the 
injection well will be contacted by fresh injection gas.
A multi-contact experiment as sketched in Figure 3.22 is designed to simulate those processes. 
The cell initially contains a known amount of reservoir oil. The experiment can be conducted either 
forward or backward. Forward means that the gas phase is moved to the subsequent stage and mixed 
with fresh reservoir oil. In a backward experiment the oil phase from the first contact is mixed with 
fresh injection gas. This process is continued for a number of stages.
A multi-contact study is performed in the same type of cell as is used for the swelling study 
(Section 3.2.1), and the first contact is experimentally carried out in the same way as for an equilib￾rium contact experiment (Section 3.2.2).
In a forward multi-contact experiment, a known volume of reservoir fluid is in a second cell 
mixed with the equilibrium gas from the first cell. The mixing and equilibration take place the same 
way as in the first cell. This procedure is repeated for three to four stages using the gas recovered 
from the previous contact. After four stages, the amount of equilibrium gas is generally insufficient 
to form a gas phase large enough for analyses if again mixed with reservoir oil.
In a backward multi-contact experiment, the liquid phase remaining after the equilibrium gas 
has been removed is contacted by a known volume and known molar amount of fresh injection 
gas. The mixing and equilibration take place the same way as for the first contact. This procedure 
is repeated for a number of stages (usually maximum four) until the volume of gas formed at the 
selected test pressure is insufficient for any analyses.

East Oil and Gas Show, Manama, Bahrain, 20–23 March, 2011.90 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
As a quality check, mass and molar balances are performed for each contact. The mass and 
moles of fluid charged to the cells are calculated using the densities, molecular weights, and vol￾umes. The densities, molecular weights, and volumes of the gas and oil equilibrium phases (at the 
selected test pressure) are then used to calculate the mass and moles at each stage. The mass/mole 
in the last cell plus the mass/mole removed should add up to the mass/moles charged to the cell. As 
a rule of thumb, the deviation should not be more than 2%.
The quantities reported from multi-contact experiments are listed in Table 3.43.
A multi-contact experiment requires careful design. The purpose of the study is to get experi￾mental data for the phase behavior at near-miscible conditions. On the other hand, miscibility must 
not develop, as there would be no gas or oil to move forward to the next contract from a miscible 
(single phase) fluid. It is an idea to choose the mixing ratios in such a way that the two first contacts 
are for oil systems and the last two contacts for gas systems. That means the saturation point of the 
total fluid in the first two contacts will be bubble points, whereas in the last two contacts they will be 
dew points. At the optimum mixing ratio, the volumes of gas and oil at the contact pressure will be 
approximately equal. A PVT simulator can be helpful to design a multi-contact experiment.
In a reservoir context, a forward multi-contact experiment will follow the fluid at the gas-oil front 
and a backward experiment will follow the fluid near the injection well. The experiment is therefore 
mainly designed for 100% vaporizing or 100% condensing and not for combined vaporizing/con￾densing drives. The terms vaporizing and condensing are explained in Chapter 15.
Table 3.44 shows molar compositions of a reservoir fluid for which multi-contact data is shown 
in Tables 3.45 and 3.46. Two multi-contact experiments were carried out, one with the hydrocarbon 
injection gas in Table 3.44 and another with CO2 as injection gas.

The oil recovery it is possible to achieve with gas injection can be measured in a slim tube apparatus

glass beads. The pore volume is around 65 ml. The experiment is carried out at the reservoir tempera￾ture at a series of pressures between the saturation pressure and the highest operating pressure, which 
is typically around 700 bar. This coil is cleaned, evacuated, and weighed before the test commences.
The coil is precharged with toluene at the first test pressure and the free (pore) volume determined. 
The coil is then heated in an oven to the reservoir temperature and stabilized at the run pressure. 
Reservoir fluid is injected into the coil, and toluene is displaced at a constant pressure. Once all the 
toluene is displaced, a quick atmospheric test is performed on the produced reservoir fluid. The atmo￾spheric test determines the GOR, stock tank density, and formation volume factor of the reservoir fluid. 
This is to check that the data corresponds with the reservoir fluid and all toluene has been displaced.
The test gas is injected at a fixed rate (~6 ml per hour), and the evolved products (displaced fluid) 
are continuously collected. The evolved gas volume, weight, and liquid density are measured every 
hour. This injection rate is continued for the first 6 hours and then increased to approximately 8 ml 
per hour for the rest of the test. At a certain point, gas breakthrough occurs. It will be observed by a 
significant increase in GOR, decrease in liquid density, and change in gas density. A windowed PVT 94 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
cell and camera can also be used to visually observe the time at which gas breakthrough occurs. A 
high pressure Paar densitometer can be used to measure the density of the produced liquid.
The recovery is reported for 1.2 pore volume of test gas injected, but the test is allowed to con￾tinue until slightly more pore volume (say, 1.4) has been injected into the coil. The remainder of the 
gas in the coil is allowed to flow to atmospheric pressure (“blow down”). Any residual oil produced 
during the blow down is collected and weighed. The coil is then disconnected and weighed to deter￾mine the weight of the residual oil remaining at the end of the test. This is used for the material 
balance. This test is normally run at four to six different test pressures. A plot of recovery at 1.2 
pore volume versus the test pressure as sketched in Figure 3.24 is used to determine the minimum 
miscibility pressure (MMP). It is taken to be the intersection of the line joining the high recoveries 
(typically above 90%) and the line joining the low recoveries.
Table 3.47 gives the composition of a reservoir oil, which has been used in a slim tube experi￾ment with pure CO2 as injection gas. The results (Zuo et al. 1993) of the slim tube experiment are 
presented in Table 3.48 and plotted in Figure 3.25. The minimum miscibility pressure is seen to be 
at approximately 207 bar.

3.2.5 Gas Revaporization Experiment
A gas revaporization experiment is sketched in Figure 3.26 and is designed for gas condensates 
undergoing gas injection. A portion of reservoir fluid (around 50 ml) is charged to a gas condensate 
PVT cell and stabilized at reservoir temperature and working pressure. A CCE test is performed on 
this reservoir fluid to determine the dew point pressure and the volume at the dew point. The test is 
continued until the fluid is expanded to the gas revaporization pressure. At this pressure, a known 
portion of gas is pumped off from the cell until the volume returns to the volume at dew point pres￾sure. The composition of the pumped-off gas phase is measured.
A known volume of injection gas is charged to the cell, and the content in the cell is then mixed 
to get a new mixture at the test conditions. At these conditions the sample is allowed to stabilize 
to have the gas and liquid phases in equilibrium. Once equilibrium is attained, the total sample 
volume and the volumes of the gas and liquid phases are determined. The excess volume of the 
gas phase is pumped off to return the cell volume to that at the dew point pressure. The composi￾tion of the pumped-off phase is measured. The test is repeated for (typically) four more steps and

the change in fluid properties, composition, and liquid volume as a function of gas revaporization 
process is determined. The primary results from a gas revaporization experiment are listed in 
Table 3.49.
Three gas revaporization experiments have been carried out on the reservoir fluid in Table 3.50
(Kumar et al. 2015) using three different injection gases, also shown in Table 3.50. One is pure 
nitrogen (N2), the second one is pure carbon dioxide (CO2), and the third one is a gas mixture with 
a methane (C1) mole percentage of 91.64. The results of the gas revaporization experiments are 
shown in Table 3.51. Of the three injection gases, CO2 has the highest ability to revaporize already 
condensed liquid. After injection of 0.4 mole CO2 per initial mole reservoir fluid, the liquid volume 
percentage is reduced by around 56%, whereas the reduction of the liquid volume after injection 
of the same molar amount of the gas is only 11% with N2 as injection gas and 28% when the gas 
mixture is used as injection gas.

Equations of State
The majority of calculations of the pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) relation carried out for oil and 
gas mixtures are based on a cubic equation of state. Cubic equations date back more than 100 years to 
the famous van der Waals equation (van der Waals 1873). The most commonly used equations in the 
petroleum industry today are similar to the van der Waals equation, but it took almost a century for the 
industry to accept this type of equation as a valuable engineering tool. The first cubic equation of state to 
obtain widespread use was the one presented by Redlich and Kwong (1949). Soave (1972) and Peng and 
Robinson (1976 and 1978) further developed this equation in the 1970s. In 1982, Peneloux et al. (1982) 
presented a volume-shift concept for improving liquid density predictions of the two former equations. 
Computer technology has made it possible, within seconds, to perform millions of multicomponent 
phase equilibrium and physical property calculations with an equation of state as the thermodynamic 
basis. This chapter presents some of the most popular cubic equations of state as well as the noncubic 
PC-SAFT and GERG-2008 equations of state. Chapter 6 describes the application of cubic equations of 
state in phase equilibrium (flash) calculations, Chapter 8 the derivation of physical properties from cubic 
equations of state, and Chapter 16 the application of cubic equations of state to mixtures with water and 
other aqueous components as well as an extension of cubic equations with an association term.
4.1 VAN DER WAALS EQUATION
When deriving the first cubic equation of state, van der Waals used the phase behavior of a pure 
component as the starting point. Figure 4.1 shows schematically pressure (P) versus molar volume 
(V) curves for a pure component at various temperatures. At temperatures far above the critical (T1 in 
Figure 4.1), the pressure–volume (PV) curves exhibit a hyperbolic shape suggesting that the pressure 
is inversely proportional to the molar volume. This behavior is known from the ideal gas law:
P RT
V = (4.1)
where R equals the gas constant and T the absolute temperature. The molar volume of a com￾ponent behaving like an ideal gas also at high pressures would asymptotically approach zero for 
the pressure going toward infinity. As seen from Figure 4.1, this is not the case in reality. With 
increasing pressure, the molar volume approaches a limiting value, which van der Waals named b. 
Rearrangement of Equation 4.1 to
V RT
P = (4.2)
suggests that the b parameter should enter the equation as follows:
V RT
P
= + b (4.3)
which would give the following expression for P:
P RT
V b = - (4.4)
4100 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
At temperatures below the critical (T3 in Figure 4.1), a vapor-to-liquid phase transition may take 
place. Consider a component at temperature T3 initially at a low pressure and in vapor form. By 
decreasing the volume while maintaining a constant temperature, T3, the pressure will increase and 
at some stage a liquid phase may start to form showing that the dew point pressure has been reached. 
A further lowering of the volume will take place at a constant pressure until all the vapor has been 
transformed into liquid. As a liquid is almost incompressible, a further reduction of the volume will 
be associated with a steep increase in pressure, as is also illustrated in Figure 4.1. The fact that the 
substance may undergo a transition from a gaseous form with the molecules far apart to a liquid 
form with the molecules much closer together shows that also attractive forces act between the mol￾ecules. These attractive forces are not accounted for in Equation 4.4, which is therefore incapable of 
describing a vapor-to-liquid phase transition.
Figure 4.2 shows a container filled with gas. The two small volume elements, v1 and v2, initially 
contain one molecule each. Suppose the force between the two volume elements is f. If another 
molecule is added to v2 keeping one molecule in v1, the force acting between the two elements will

be 2f. Addition of a third molecule to v2 will increase the force to 3f, and so on. The force of attrac￾tion between the two volume elements is therefore proportional to c2, the concentration of molecules 
in v2. If a second, third, and so on, molecule is added to v1, keeping the number of molecules in v2
constant, the force will double, triple, and so on. The force is therefore also proportional to c1, the 
concentration of molecules in v1. Thus, the force acting between the two volume elements is propor￾tional to c1 × c2. In reality, the concentration in the gas is the same everywhere, that is, c = c1 = c2, 
where c is the molecular concentration in the container. The concentration c is inversely propor￾tional to the molar volume, V, implying that the attractive force is proportional to the 1/V2. Based 
on that type of consideration, van der Waals found that the attractive term should be a constant a 
times 1/V2 leading to:
P RT
V b
a
V2 = - - (4.5)
which is the final form of the van der Waals equation. The constants a and b are equation of state 
parameters, the values of which are found by evaluating the PV curve for the critical temperature. 
This curve is also called the critical isotherm. As is illustrated in Figure 4.1, this curve has what 
looks like an inflexion point right at the critical point (Tc, Pc), implying

At the critical point, V equals the molar critical volume Vc, which is related to Tc and Pc through 
Equations 4.5 and 4.6. A total of five constants (Tc, Pc, Vc, a, and b) enter into Equations 4.5 and 
4.6 (a total of three equations). One equation is used to eliminate the molar volume V, which at the 
critical point is Vc. The two remaining equations are rearranged to give the following expressions 
for a and b:

it is seen that the van der Waals equation is cubic in V, which explains why the van der Waals and 
related equations are called cubic. Figure 4.3 shows PV curves for methane calculated using the 
van der Waals equation. At temperatures T1 > Tc and T2 = Tc, the curves qualitatively agree with 
experimental observations as sketched in Figure 4.1. At T3 < Tc, the vapor-to-liquid phase transition 
is not as in Figure 4.1 represented by a constant line in P. Starting from the high-volume (vapor) side, 
the PV curve crosses the experimental vapor pressure curve at point A after which it goes through 
a maximum, crosses the vapor pressure line a second time at point B, passes through a minimum, 
and finally crosses the vapor pressure line a third time at point C. The molar volume at point A 
equals the vapor-phase molar volume at the saturation point. The molar volume at point C equals 102 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
the liquid-phase molar volume at the saturation point. The molar volume at point B has no physical 
importance, and the whole section of the PV curve between A and C may be disregarded. Hence, 
the van der Waals equation is seen to qualitatively describe the pure-component phase behavior at 
temperatures above, equal to, and below the critical temperature.
Later developments of cubic equations of state have primarily served to improve the quantita￾tive predictions of either vapor pressure or liquid density. In addition, much effort has been used to 
extend the application area of cubic equations of state from pure components to mixtures.
4.2 REDLICH–KWONG EQUATION
The equation of Redlich and Kwong (1949) is, by many, considered the first modern equation of 
state and takes the form
P RT
V b
a
T V V b = - - ( ) +
(4.10)
By comparing this equation with the van der Waals equation (Equation 4.5), it is seen that the 
attractive term has a more complicated temperature dependence. This temperature modification 
serves to improve the vapor pressure predictions. To also improve the predictions of the liquid-phase 
molar volumes, the term V2 in the denominator of the attractive term in the van der Waals equa￾tion has, in the Redlich–Kwong equation, been replaced by V(V + b). The parameters a and b are 
found by imposing the critical point criteria expressed in Equation 4.6. This leads to the following

which corresponds to Equation 4.11, but Tc and Pc of the pure component are, in Equation 4.15, 
replaced by the cross terms Tcij and Pcij. Tcij is related to the pure component critical temperatures Tci
and Tcj of components i and j as follows:
T T T 1 k cij c = - i cj ij ( ) (4.16)
In this expression, kij is a binary interaction parameter for components i and j. For two 
identical components, kij is zero by definition. For two different nonpolar compounds, kij is 
equal to or close to zero. For a binary pair of at least one polar component, nonzero kijs are 
often appropriate. With a kij > 0 the simulated attraction between molecules of components i 
and j will be reduced as compared to a kij of zero. The mixing rule in Equation 4.16 is based 
on considerations regarding the attractive energy acting between two molecules or two bodies.

Zci and Zcj are the compressibility factors of component i and j at the pure-component critical points. 
The mixing rule used for the critical volume is based on the idea that the molecules of components 
i and j have linear dimensions proportional to the cubic roots of Vci and Vcj, respectively. The term 
within the parenthesis in Equation 4.19 is then proportional to linear length of an average molecule 
of i and j.104 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
4.3 SOAVE–REDLICH–KWONG EQUATION
Soave (1972) found that the pure-component vapor pressures calculated from the Redlich–Kwong 
(RK) equation could be improved. He suggested replacing the term a
T in the RK equation by a 
more general temperature-dependent term, a(T), giving an equation of state of the form:

plotted a

 versus 
T
Tc
 for a number of pure hydrocarbons. The term a
ac
 was determined 
from vapor pressure data. The type of plots Soave made is shown schematically in Figure 4.4. He 
observed an almost linear relationship indicating that a linear dependence should be chosen for the 
square root of the preceding a parameter ratio versus the square root of the reduced temperature

In Equation 4.25, ω is the acentric factor as defined in Equation 1.1. Equations 4.21 and 4.24 may 
be combined to give:

which is in accordance with Soave’s observations and expresses a linear relationship between

The coefficients in the expression for m (Equation 4.25) were determined by a data fit to experimen￾tal vapor pressure data for nine pure hydrocarbons.
It is explained in Chapter 6 how to make vapor pressure calculations for pure components using 
a cubic equation of state.
With the Soave temperature dependence, α(T) = 1 at the critical temperature, where a(T) there￾fore becomes equal to ac. The terms ac and b in Equations 4.22 and 4.23 are found making use of 
the critical point criteria expressed in Equation 4.6. The constants 0.42747 and 0.08664 are often 
referred to as Ωa and Ωb.
Graboski and Daubert (1978) refitted the three coefficients in Equation 4.25 to 0.48508, 1.55171, 
and –0.15613 based on vapor pressure data for more components including aromatics and iso￾paraffins, but these coefficients have not obtained as widespread use as those proposed by Soave.
Mathias and Copeman (1983) have presented a more flexible temperature dependence for α:

It is seen that the Mathias–Copeman expression reduces to Equation 4.24 for C1 = m and C2 = 
C3 = 0. Khashayar and Moshfeghian (1998) have presented Mathias–Copeman coefficients for 
C1–C4 hydrocarbons for use with the SRK equation as shown in Table 4.1. Table 4.1 also shows 
Mathias–Copeman coefficients for water and methanol (Dahl and Michelsen 1990). In general, 
the Mathias and Copeman temperature dependence is more widely used for polar compounds, for 
example, water and methanol, than for hydrocarbons.
Recalling that the compressibility factor Z is defined as follows:
Z PV
RT = (4.29)
Equation 4.20 may be rewritten in terms of Z:
Z Z A B B Z AB 3 2 2 - + ( ) - - - = 0 (4.30)
where A and B are given by the following expressions:
A a(T)P
R T2 2 = (4.31)
B bP
RT = (4.32)106 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
With the SRK equation, the compressibility factor of a pure component at its critical point will 
always be equal to 0.333. This can be shown by replacing T and P in Equations 4.31 and 4.32 by Tc 
and Pc, a(T) in Equation 4.31 by ac from Equation 4.22, and b in Equation 4.32 by the expression 
for b in Equation 4.23. The derived expressions for A and B are inserted into Equation 4.30, which 
is solved for Z.
For an N-component mixture, Soave suggested to find a and b from
a z z a i j ij

where z stands for mole fraction, i and j are component indices, and
a a a 1 k ij = - i j ij ( ) (4.35)
With these mixing rules, Soave, as outlined in Figure 4.5, defines a hypothetical component with 
one a and one b parameter representing the entire fluid mixture. In phase equilibrium calculations 
with two or more phases, each phase will have its own a and b parameters.
The parameter kij is a binary interaction coefficient similar to the one entering into the RK mix￾ing rule of Equation 4.16. Examples of binary interaction parameters recommended for the SRK 
equation are given in Table 4.2. It is seen that the interaction parameter between N2 and CO2 is 
negative, which suggests that the attraction between an N2 and a CO2 molecule is higher than would

4.4 PENG–ROBINSON EQUATION
The liquid-phase densities predicted using the SRK equation are in general too low. Peng and 
Robinson (1976) traced this deficiency to the fact that the SRK equation predicts the pure-component

factors for the C1–C10 n-paraffins. The critical compressibility factors are generally of the order

is lower than 0.333 as found with the SRK equation but still high compared to the experimental 
critical compressibility factors presented in Table 4.3. For mixtures, Peng and Robinson recommend 
to calculate a and b using the same mixing rules as for SRK and shown in Equations 4.33 and 4.34.

4.5 PENELOUX VOLUME CORRECTION
Until 1982, the application of the SRK equation was essentially limited to phase equilibrium and 
gas-phase density calculations. Owing to poor liquid density predictions, the SRK equation was 
often applied with external liquid density correlations. This caused problems, for example, for near￾critical systems for which it is difficult to distinguish between a gas and a liquid phase. In 1982,

Peneloux et  al. (1982) presented a SRK modification with a volume translation parameter. The 
Peneloux equation (SRK–Peneloux) takes the form:
P RT
V b
a(T)
V c V b 2c = - -
( ) + + ( ) +
(4.43)
The parameter c is called a volume translation or volume-shift parameter. It is possible to relate 
the molar volumes and the b parameters entering into the SRK and SRK–Peneloux equations as 
follows:
V V c Pen S = - RK (4.44)
b b c Pen S = - RK (4.45)
where the subindex SRK stands for SRK equation and Pen for SRK–Peneloux equation.
The parameter c is assigned a value that at a particular pressure and temperature makes the 
calculated liquid molar volume agree with experimental observations. This can be done without 
affecting phase equilibrium results. The SRK–Peneloux equation will, for example, give the same 
pure-component vapor pressures and the same mixture dew and bubble point pressures as the clas￾sical SRK equation, as presented in Equation 4.20. The term volume translation or volume-shift 
parameter is used for c to signal that it affects volume without affecting equilibrium phase composi￾tions. Peneloux et al. (1982) recommended the following expression to be used for c of nonhydro￾carbons and hydrocarbons lighter than C7
c
0.40768 RT 0.29441 Z
P
c RA
c
= ( ) - (4.46)
where ZRA is the Rackett compressibility factor (Rackett 1970; Spencer and Danner 1973):
Z 0.29056 0.08775 RA = - w (4.47)
The constants in Equation 4.46 were found by a fit to densities of saturated liquid C1–C6 hydro￾carbons at atmospheric pressure. It is explained in Chapter 5 how to determine c for hydrocarbons 
heavier than C6.
The Peneloux volume translation concept is not limited to the SRK equation but is equally appli￾cable to the Peng–Robinson (PR) equation (Jhaveri and Youngren 1988). With the Peneloux volume 
correction, the PR equation becomes (PR–Peneloux):
P RT
V b
a(T)
V cV 2c b b c V b = - -
( ) + + ( ) +++ ( )( ) - (4.48)
For nonhydrocarbons and hydrocarbons lighter than C7, the volume-shift parameter may be 
found from:
c
0.50033RT
P (0.25969 Z ) c
c
= - RA (4.49)
where ZRA is defined in Equation 4.47.
As for the SRK–Peneloux equation, the constants in this equation were found by a fit to densities 
of saturated liquid of C1–C6 hydrocarbons at atmospheric pressure.110 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
Although it is generally acknowledged that it is necessary to volume-correct SRK liquid densi￾ties, it is less obvious whether such correction is needed for the PR equation, as the PR equation 
was developed with more focus on liquid density predictions. Figure 4.6 shows experimental and 
calculated liquid densities of three n-paraffins at their saturation points at different temperatures. 
The densities have been calculated using the SRK, the PR, and the SRK–Peneloux equations. The 
highest temperature for which results are shown is the critical temperature. The best overall agree￾ment with experimental data is obtained with the SRK–Peneloux equation. The SRK equation 
with no volume correction generally predicts too-low liquid densities. This is more pronounced 
for propane and n-hexane than for methane. For methane and propane, the PR equation predicts 
too-high liquid densities at the lowest temperatures. Good results are obtained for n-hexane with 
the PR-equation but still not as good as those obtained with the SRK–Peneloux equation.
The phase equilibrium results obtained with the Peneloux-volume-corrected SRK and PR equa￾tions are identical to those obtained with the original equations with no volume correction. This 
comes from the fact that (taking the SRK equation as an example) the SRK and SRK–Peneloux 
fugacity coefficients of component i are interrelated through:
ln ln c P
RT i,SRK i,Pen
i p p = + (4.50)
The term fugacity coefficient is explained in Appendix A, where it is also explained that at 
equilibrium between a vapor phase (V) and a liquid phase (L) the following relation will apply for 
component i:

showing that SRK and SRK–Peneloux equations will provide exactly the same results for phase 
compositions and therefore also for phase amounts. It is only the molar volume (phase densities) 
and, as outlined in Chapter 8, some other physical properties that differ. The same applies for the 
PR and PR–Peneloux equations (Equations 4.36 and 4.48).
The Peneloux equation not only corrects liquid-phase densities but also the vapor-phase densi￾ties. This is illustrated in Figure 4.7, which shows a PV curve for n-hexane at 15°C calculated using 
the SRK equation (Equation 4.20) and using the SRK–Peneloux equation (Equation 4.43). At 1 bar, 
the SRK molar volume is found to be 148 cm3, while the real molar volume of n-hexane at these 
conditions is 130 cm3. By assigning the Peneloux volume-shift parameter (c in Equation 4.43) a 
value of 148–130 = 18 cm3/mol, it is possible to match the liquid volume of n-hexane at 15°C and 
1 bar. The PV curve calculated using SRK–Peneloux is also shown in Figure 4.7. The SRK–Peneloux 
molar volumes are consistently a constant c (18 cm3/mol in Figure 4.7) lower than SRK volumes. 
Because the gas-phase molar volumes are high, the volume correction, however, has only a minor 
influence on the gas volumes but a significant influence on the liquid volumes. This is the whole 
idea of the correction.
Chapter 5 will introduce temperature dependent volume corrections.

4.6 OTHER CUBIC EQUATIONS OF STATE
The increasing popularity of cubic equations of state in the 1970s and 1980s inspired thermody￾namics research groups to propose alternatives to the SRK and PR equations. Many of these equa￾tions have the general form:
P RT

( )
( )( ) (4.53)
The SRK, PR, SRK–Peneloux, and PR–Peneloux equations (Equations 4.20, 4.36, 4.43, and 
4.48) all belong to the general class of equations expressed through Equation 4.53. The values of 
the parameters δ1–δ3 for each equation are shown in Table 4.4. Equation 4.53 offers the opportunity 
to include three different volumetric correction parameters, δ1, δ2, and δ3. The SRK and PR equa￾tions only make use of one parameter, b in Equations (4.20) and (4.36). The Peneloux corrected 
SRK and PR equations make use of two volume correction parameters, b and c in Equations (4.43) 
and (4.48)
The Adachi–Lu–Sugie (ALS) equation (1983) is an example of an equation making full use of 
the extra flexibility presented by the 3 δ-parameters in Equation 4.53. It takes the form:

The parameters entering into Equation 4.61 through 4.63 were determined by regression to volu￾metric phase equilibrium and enthalpy data for pure components and mixtures. The classical mix￾ing rules in Equations 4.33 and 4.34 are used for the parameters a and b1–b3.
Making use of all three volume parameters in Equation 4.54, the ALS equation is more flex￾ible than the SRK and PR equations even when the two latter are volume corrected. The ALS 
equation has, however, not achieved the same popularity as SRK and PR. In the petroleum indus￾try, it is important to have some kind of industrial standards to enable different companies work￾ing on the same project to produce consistent calculation results. PR seems to be the preferred 
choice in North America. Europe generally prefers SRK, while the rest of the world is more 
divided between the two equations of state. Since SRK and PR are by far the most commonly 
applied cubic equations of state in the petroleum industry, the example calculations for cubic 
equations presented in this book will all be based on either the SRK or PR equation, most often 
with Peneloux volume correction.
4.7 FUGACITY COEFFICIENTS
Phase equilibrium calculations using an equation of state are carried out as described in Chapter 
6. Fugacity coefficients are required in these calculations. The term fugacity coefficient is further 
explained in Appendix A. The SRK expression for the fugacity coefficient of component i in a 
mixture is

The fugacity coefficients for the Peneloux volume-corrected SRK and PR equations (Equations 
4.43 and 4.48) can be found from Equations 4.64 and 4.65 making use of Equation 4.50. When using 
Equation 4.50 for the PR equation, the subindex SRK must be replaced by PR.114 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
4.8 NONCLASSICAL MIXING RULES
Cubic equations of state were originally intended for hydrocarbons and other essentially nonpolar 
systems, but the widespread use of cubic equations for oil and gas mixtures has inspired work on 
extending its application area to mixtures containing polar compounds. This will be further dealt 
with in Chapter 16.
4.9 PC-SAFT EQUATION
PC-SAFT (Gross and Sadowski 2001) is an example of a non-cubic equation of state that has found 
application in the oil industry. It is based in statistical mechanics, which is a molecular approach 
to describe macroscopic systems. PC-SAFT stands for perturbed chain statistical association fluid 
theory. The model concept was developed by Chapman et al. (1988, 1990).
The compressibility factor Z is defined as
Z PV
RT = (4.66)
where P is pressure, V molar volume, R the gas constant, and T the absolute temperature. Z = 1 
for an ideal gas, which is one of a high molar volume thanks to a low pressure. For lower molar 
volumes (higher pressures), Z deviates from 1, which can be expressed through a Taylor series 
expansion:
Z 1 A
V
B
V
C
V ... 2 3 = + + + + (4.67)
This Z-factor expression is called the virial equation, and A, B, and C are called virial coeffi￾cients. The viral equation may be truncated after the first, second, or third term, depending on the 
molar volume. The lower the molar volume (the higher the pressure), the more terms are needed.
Similar to the virial equation, the PC-SAFT model expresses the compressibility factor as a 
deviation from the ideal gas compressibility factor of 1.0:
Z 1 Z Z hc disp = + + (4.68)
Zhc is the hard-chain contribution to the compressibility factor accounting for repulsive molecular 
interactions and Zdisp is an attractive (dispersive) term.
PC-SAFT represents each molecule through three parameters:
• Number of segments: m
• Segment diameter: σ
• Segment energy: ε
The number of segments is 1 for methane. For heavier hydrocarbons, it is a little lower than the 
number of hydrocarbon segments.
The PC-SAFT approach is schematically illustrated in Figure 4.8. PC-SAFT sees a pure fluid as 
consisting of equal-sized hard spheres or segments (a in Figure 4.8). These hard spheres are then 
combined to hard chain molecules (b in Figure 4.8). These hard-chain molecules interact with each 
other (c in Figure 4.8).
Figure 4.9 shows a schematic view of a PC-SAFT mixture containing two molecules with m1
and m2 number of segments, diameters of σ1 and σ2, and an intersegment radial distance r1,2. ε is 
the segment energy, which can be understood as the maximum attraction between two molecules.Equations of State 115

To better understand the qualitative differences between the PC-SAFT equation and a cubic 
equation of state, it may be useful to consider the latter the equivalent of Equation 4.68. A cubic 
equation of state consists of a repulsive term and an attractive term

Figure 4.11 shows a plot of the Z-factor of n-heptane calculated using the SRK equation with 
Peneloux volume correction. Also shown are the contributions from the
• Ideal gas term (Zid)
• Cubic equation repulsive term (Zrepulsive)
• Cubic equation attractive term (Zattractive)
As can be seen from Equation 4.91, the repulsive term of a cubic equation of state for a constant 
temperature is bound to increase proportionally with the pressure. For higher pressures, the attrac￾tive term will approach −1, for which value the ideal gas term and the attractive term will cancel 
out. This means that the Z-factor for high pressure asymptotically will approach the repulsive term 
(Equation 4.91). There is no experimental evidence that the liquid volume should decrease (exactly) 
linearly with 1/P for pressures above a certain level, and cubic equations of state do have some 
problems matching experimental data for the isothermal compressibility at high pressures (the com￾pressibility is defined in Equation 3.4). With the PC-SAFT equation, both the hard chain term and 
the dispersion term (as can be seen from Figure 4.10) influence the liquid phase Z-factor at high 
pressures and none of them approaches a constant value. Furthermore, these two terms are found 
from more flexible expressions, enabling a more accurate description of the molecular interactions 
and the volumetric response to pressure changes.
4.10 GERG-2008 EQUATION OF STATE
When very accurate simulation results are required for a natural gas mixture, the GERG-2008 
equation (Kunz and Wagner 2012) can be a better choice than a cubic equation. GERG stands for 
Groupe Européen de Recherches Gazières (European Gas Research Group), and the equation was 
developed to provide accurate physical properties of natural gas mixtures. The GERG-2008 equa￾tion has a different basis than cubic equations, which are based on considerations about the repulsive 
and attractive forces acting between two molecules. Once these are well described, it is implicitly 
assumed that all other properties will fall in place. A volume-corrected cubic equation has three

equation of state parameters (a, b, and c), while the GERG-2008 many more parameters, which for 
each component have been fitted to comply with experimental data for
• Relation between pressure (P), molar volume (V), and absolute temperature (T)
• Heat capacity, CV, at constant volume
• Heat capacity, CP, at constant pressure
• Sound velocity (u)
• Enthalpy (H)
• Saturated liquid density
• Equilibrium phase compositions
The mentioned physical properties are further dealt with in Chapter 8. GERG-2008 handles mix￾tures through a correction (departure) term added to molar average terms for the pure components.
While cubic equations of state express the relation between pressure (P), molar volume (V), and 
temperature (T) directly, the GERG-2008 equation expresses the thermodynamic behavior in terms 
of the Helmholtz energy, A, which is defined as
A U= -TS (4.93)
U is internal energy, T absolute temperature, and S is entropy. These thermodynamics quantities 
are explained in Appendix A, and entropy is further dealt with in Chapter 8. The Helmholtz energy 
is a convenient choice as thermodynamic basis for an equation of state as it, as outlined by, for 
example, Bell and Jäger (2016), is relatively easy to derive other thermodynamic quantities from the 
Helmholtz energy. The pressure is, for example, related to the Helmholtz energy as follows:

The GERG-2008 equation can be used for the components in Table 4.6 and mixtures of those 
components. Because several parameters are needed that are either specific for a particular compo￾nent or for a particular component pair, it would be quite cumbersome to extend the application of 
the GERG-2008 equation to new components.
GERG-2008 is developed to provide a high accuracy in the temperature and pressure range:
90 K ≤ T ≤ 450 K and P ≤ 350 atm (355 bar)
Good accuracy can also be expected outside these ranges when within the following ranges:
60 K ≤ T ≤ 700 K and P ≤ 700 atm (709 bar)
The EOS-CG equation (Gernert and Span 2016) is a further development of the GERG-2008 
equation that uses the mathematical approach of the GERG-2008 equation and presents new mixing 
parameters for mixtures of carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and carbon monoxide. 
The aim was to improve the calculation results for phase boundaries of binary and multi-component 
mixtures, where water and/or carbon dioxide is involved.
4.11 SPAN–WAGNER EQUATION
Span and Wagner (1996) have presented an equation for pure CO2 which is very accurate and is 
seen as a standard for simulations on pure CO2. Like the GERG-2008 equation, it expresses the

4.12 OTHER EQUATIONS OF STATE
Much exploration activity is directed toward deep reservoirs at high temperature and high pressure. 
The ability of the classical cubic equations of state to represent the molecular interactions at such 
conditions has often been questioned. More sophisticated equations of state have been proposed, 
some of which include terms to account for the strong repulsive forces acting at high pressures, such 
as Benedict et al. (1940), Lee and Kesler (1975), Donohue and Vimalchand (1988), and Lin et al. 
(1983). None of these equations have obtained widespread use in the oil industry.
Wei and Sadus (2000) have given an extensive review of equation of states, cubic as well as 
noncubic.
4.13 POSTSCRIPT ON THE ROLE OF CUBIC 
EQUATIONS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY
This chapter has presented the volume-corrected SRK and PR equations that are today’s standard 
in the oil industry. Strictly speaking, these equations are only minor modifications of the van der 
Waals equation presented in 1873. It was not until the late 1970s that real effort was invested in 
making cubic equations available as an engineering tool for the oil industry. One may ask why it did 
not happen earlier and what made the use of cubic equations as widespread in the oil industry as it is 
today. The year 1973 was a turning point. That year not only saw a sharp increase in the price of oil 
but also a shortage of oil that was so great that some countries in Europe imposed car-free Sundays. 
This initiated extensive oil exploration in, among other places, the North Sea.
The increased costs of producing oil and gas condensates led to a desire in the oil industry for 
better tools to simulate the properties of reservoir fluids. With Soave’s and Peng and Robinson’s 
improvements to the van der Waals equation, the basic models were available. However, it was not 
until the mid-1980s that sufficiently comprehensive compositional analyses became available which 
allowed the determination of representative critical properties (Tc, Pc, and acentric factor) of the 
components contained in the C7+ fractions. Characterization of heavy hydrocarbons is the subject of 
the next chapter. Even a correct characterization of the reservoir fluid is not sufficient to carry out 124 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
efficient and fast flash calculations. As described in Chapter 6, it requires methods to determine the 
number of phases and numerical methods to converge the flash equations quickly and efficiently.
The development of computers is what binds these technologies together. Only very simple cal￾culations with a cubic equation of state such as determination of single-phase Z-factors can be per￾formed without the use of a computer. Therefore, for almost 100 years, the van der Waals equation 
was more of a theoretical invention than a practical tool. The same applies to a method proposed by 
Gibbs around the year 1900 for determining the number of phases. The latter method is described 
in Chapter 6.
Figure 4.13 schematically shows the historical development of PVT simulation methods.

C7+ Characterization
To perform phase equilibrium calculations on a reservoir fluid composition using a cubic equa￾tion of state, the critical temperature (Tc), the critical pressure (Pc), and the acentric factor (ω) are 
required for each component contained in the mixture. In addition, a binary interaction param￾eter (kij) is needed for each pair of components. If an equation of state with volume correction is 
used (Peneloux et al. 1982), a volume shift parameter must further be assigned to each component. 
Naturally occurring oil or gas condensate mixtures may contain thousands of different components. 
Such a high number is impractical in flash calculations. Some components must be lumped together 
and represented as pseudocomponents. C7+ characterization consists of representing the hydrocar￾bons with seven and more carbon atoms (the heptane plus or C7+ fraction) as a convenient number 
of pseudocomponents and finding the needed equation of state parameters (Tc, Pc, and ω) for each 
of these pseudocomponents. The characterization and lumping problem is illustrated in Figure 5.1.
5.1 CLASSES OF COMPONENTS
The components contained in oil and gas condensate mixtures can be divided into three classes:
• Defined components to C6: These components are N2, CO2, H2S, C1, C2, C3, iC4, nC4, iC5, 
nC5, and C6 (C6 is usually considered to be pure nC6, though branched and cyclic C6 com￾ponents may also be present in the C6 fraction).
• C7+ fractions: It is common to see some defined C7−C10 components quantitatively ana￾lyzed for, but a complete component analysis of the C7+ fraction will not be doable. The 
number of components is simply too high. Instead the C7+ fraction is split into carbon num￾ber fractions, each of which contains hydrocarbons with boiling points within a given tem￾perature interval. The temperature intervals can be seen in Table 2.3 and are determined 
by the boiling points of the n-paraffins. If a true boiling point (TBP) analysis as presented 
in Chapter 2 has been carried out, measured densities at standard conditions (atmospheric 
pressure and 15°C) and measured molecular weights will also be available for each C7+
fraction. When characterizing a C7+ fraction, it is essential to take into consideration the 
diversity of hydrocarbon components contained in the fraction. Figure 5.2 shows four dif￾ferent components belonging to the C9 fraction. The importance of structural differences 
for the phase behavior is illustrated in Figure 5.3. The dew point of a binary mixture of 
C1 and C9 is seen to depend heavily on the chemical structure of the C9 component. The 
maximum dew point temperature is around 20°C higher when C9 is nC9 than when it is 
dimethylcyclohexane.
• Plus fraction: The plus fraction consists of the components that are too heavy to be 
separated into individual carbon number fractions. If a TBP analysis has been carried 
out, the average molecular weight and density of the plus fraction will be measured and 
reported.
Each of the preceding component classes will be dealt with separately in the following subsections.
5.1.1 Defined Components to C6
Tc, Pc, and ω of the defined components can be determined experimentally and the experimental 
values looked up on the Internet or in textbooks on applied thermodynamics. Literature values are

5.1.2 C7+ Fractions
Coats (1985) wrote one of the earliest papers on fluid characterization, and his paper exempli￾fies that in the early 1980s, reservoir fluid compositions would usually stop at C7+. The C7+
characterization therefore had to be based on a guessed molar C7+ distribution.
In the mid-1980s, fluid compositions to C20+ and C30+ were published (Pedersen et  al. 1985), 
which meant that the C7+ characterization could at least partly be based on measured compositions. 
A C7+ fraction will typically contain paraffinic (P), naphthenic (N), and aromatic (A) compounds. 
Table 5.2 shows the densities at standard conditions of each of the four C9 components in Figure 5.2. 
It is seen that the density increases in the order paraffin (P), naphthene (N), and aromatic (A). 
The density is therefore a good measure of the PNA distribution. The higher the density, the more 
aromatic the fraction. This density dependence is reflected in property correlations of Pedersen 
et al. (1989, 1992). Tc (K), Pc (atm), and ω of a carbon number fraction are expressed in terms of its 
molecular weight, M (g/mol), and density, ρ (g/cm3
), at atmospheric conditions:

For the SRK equation (Equation 4.20), m is related to the acentric factor, ω, through
m 0.480 1.574 0.176 2 = + w - w (5.4)
and for the PR equation (Equation 4.36) through
m 0.37464 1.54226 0.26992 2 = + w - w (5.5)
The coefficients c1–c4, d1–d5, and e1–e4 in Equations 5.1 through 5.3 have been determined from 
experimental PVT data. Because the SRK and PR equations are different, the optimum coeffi￾cients differ between the two. Two sets of coefficients are shown in Table 5.3, an SRK and a PR set 
(Pedersen et al. 1989, 1992, 2004). The coefficients are the same with and without Peneloux volume 
correction.
The Peneloux parameters (c in Equations 4.43 and 4.48) for defined components can be found 
from Equations 4.46 and 4.47. The Peneloux volume shift parameter of C7+ pseudocomponent i can

appropriate equation of state (SRK or PR) with no volume correction. Equation 5.6 ensures that the 
Peneloux volume of pseudocomponent i agrees with the experimentally determined density at 15°C 
and atmospheric pressure. Pedersen et al. (2004) have shown that the thermal expansion of heavy 
oils as dealt with in Section 5.7 is somewhat underpredicted with a constant Peneloux correction 
determined from Equation 5.6. At higher temperatures, the simulated liquid densities are higher 
than seen experimentally. According to the ASTM 1250–80 correlation, the density, ρ, of a stable 
oil varies with temperature according to the formula (ρ in kg/m3

Pedersen et al. (2004) suggest to make use of Equation 5.7 for C7+ components to introduce a 
temperature-dependent Peneloux parameter in the SRK-P and PR-P equations:
c c c (T 288.15) i 0 = +i 1i - (5.9)
T is the absolute temperature in K, c0i the usual Peneloux parameter of component i as deter￾mined from Equation 5.6 for a temperature of 288.15 K (15°C), and c1i a temperature-dependent 
term determined to give a density variation of component i from T0 = 288.15 K to T1 = 353.15 K 
compliant with Equation 5.7.
Other property correlations have been presented by Cavett (1964), Kesler and Lee (1976), Daubert 
(1980), Sim and Daubert (1980), Riazi and Daubert (1980), Twu (1983, 1984), Jalowka and Daubert 
(1986), Watanasiri et al. (1985), Teja et al. (1990), and Riazi (1997). Newman (1981) has evaluated 
a number of Tc and Pc correlations for use on aromatic fluids, and Whitson (1982) has investigated 
what difference it makes for equation of state predictions to use different correlations. A correlation 
that works well with one cubic equation of state may not work equally well with a different equation 
of state.
5.1.3 Plus Fraction
Characterization of the plus fraction involves the following:
• Estimation of the mole fraction of each carbon number contained in the plus fraction
• Estimation of Tc, Pc, and ω of the resulting carbon number fractions
• Lumping of the carbon number fractions into a reasonable number of pseudocomponents
Pedersen et al. (1983, 1984) observed a pattern in the compositions of oil and gas condensate res￾ervoir fluids. For the carbon number fractions above C6, an approximate linear relationship is seen 
between carbon number and the logarithm of the corresponding mole fraction, zN:
CN = A + B ln zN (5.10)
The dots in Figure 5.4 show a plot of the logarithm of the mole fractions of the C7–C19 fractions 
against carbon number for the reservoir fluid in Table 5.4. It is seen that the molar distribution for this 
mixture is in reasonable agreement with Equation 5.10. This suggests that the mole fractions of the C7+ Characterization 131

carbon number fractions heavier than C19 can be determined by extrapolating the best-fit line for the 
carbon number fractions C7–C19 (full-drawn line in Figure 5.4). These mole fractions are, however,

C+ is the carbon number of the plus fraction (20 for the mixture in Table 5.4) and Cmax the heaviest 
carbon number fraction considered. Equations 5.11 and 5.12 can be used to determine the constants 
A and B in Equation 5.10. For ordinary reservoir fluids, C80 is a reasonable choice as the heaviest 
component (Cmax) to be considered. In heavy oils, components as heavy as C200 may influence the 
phase behavior (Pedersen et al. 2004). Having determined the constants A and B, the mole fractions 
of each carbon number fraction contained in the plus fraction may be determined from Equation 
5.10. As is illustrated by the dashed line in Figure 5.4, the slope of the line relating mole fractions 
to carbon numbers for the C20+ subfractions may deviate slightly from the line found by extrapolat￾ing the best-fit line for the carbon number fractions. The mass balance equations (Equations 5.11 
and 5.12) must be fulfilled, and the deviation from a straight line simply means that the logarithmic 
dependence expressed in Equation 5.10 is only approximate.
The molar distribution function in Equation 5.10 can be explained using the theory of chemical 
reaction equilibria (Sørensen et al. 2013; Boesen et al. 2023). If the normal paraffins CnH2n+2 and 
Cn+1H2(n+1)+2 were to form from the pure elements, the reaction equilibrium would be

Table 5.5 shows the Gibbs free energies of formation for the normal paraffins from nC7 to nC20 
in gas and liquid forms (Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data 1982). Also shown is 
how much ΔG of formation increases from one Cn to the next one. For both gas and liquid states 
the increase is seen to be almost constant independent of carbon number. That means the term

The data in Table 5.5 is for pure substances at 25°C. There will be an additional contribution 
to ΔG from transferring the hydrocarbons from pure form into a hydrocarbon mixture at a differ￾ent temperature, but this contribution is an order of magnitude lower than ΔG of formation. Also, 
the C7+ fractions will contain other components than n-paraffins. For heavy oils dominated by 
aromatics including biodegraded oils, Equation 5.10 may not apply until after ~C15 (Krejbjerg and 
Pedersen 2006). Most reservoir fluids are, however, dominated by paraffins and paraffinic side 
branches on aromatic and naphthenic molecules. For those reservoir fluids it can be concluded that 
the observed dependence of C7+ mole fractions versus carbon number expressed in Equation 5.10 
has a foundation in the theory of chemical reaction equilibria.
The densities of the C7+ fractions usually increase with carbon number. As is illustrated by the 
circles in Figure 5.5, the density is reasonably represented, assuming the relation

and the density of the last carbon number fraction before the plus fraction (e.g., density of C19 for a 
composition to C20+). It is seen from Figure 5.5 that the slope of the (dashed) line giving the correct 
overall density of the plus fraction deviates slightly from that found by extrapolating the best-fit (full 
drawn) line for the densities of the C7+ fractions analyzed for (e.g., C7–C19 in Figure 5.5). The density 
correlation expressed in Equation 5.20 is, in other words, only approximate.
Finally, it is assumed that the molecular weight, MN, of a given carbon number fraction, CN, can 
be determined from the equation
MN = 14 CN – 4 (5.22)
The constant 14 expresses that approximately two hydrogen atoms accompany each extra carbon 
atom. The atomic weight of carbon is 12 and that of hydrogen is 1, giving a total molecular weight 
increment of 14 per extra carbon atom. The term (−4) in Equation 5.22 accounts for the presence of 
aromatic structures in the reservoir fluids. An aromatic contains fewer hydrogen atoms per carbon 
atom than a paraffin.
From the densities and molecular weights estimated in this manner, Equations 5.1 through 5.5 
may readily be used to determine Tc, Pc, and ω of the subfractions of the plus fraction. The Peneloux 
parameter of the subfractions of the plus fraction may be determined in the same manner as for the 
fractions C7–C19 (Equation 5.6).
A compositional analysis to C20+ like the one in Table 5.4 is established by combining composi￾tional data from a gas chromatographic (GC) analysis and a TBP analysis. These two techniques are 
further dealt with in Chapter 2. A TBP analysis will seldom be made, and the fluid characterization 
must in most cases be performed solely based on a GC analysis. This type of analysis is not prepara￾tive; that is, it does not produce enough sample to enable molecular weight and density measurements

on individual carbon number fractions. The default densities of Katz and Firoozabadi given in Table 
2.3 are often used to fill out the gap in molecular weight and density data. This is, however, not to be 
recommended as the Katz and Firoozabadi densities are for paraffinic oils and therefore very low. 
Table 5.6 presents generalized C7+ densities for paraffinic reservoir fluids and for naphthenic and aro￾matic fluids from the North Sea (Rønningsen et al. 1989). These values are based on compositional 
data for 77 different reservoir fluids. The Katz and Firoozabadi densities in Table 2.3 are close to those 
for the paraffinic fluids but significantly lower than those for the naphthenic and aromatic fluids.
When no TBP analysis exists, Equation 5.20 may be used to split up the C7+ density on carbon 
number fractions. The constants C and D can be determined subject to the mass balance constraint 
in Equation 5.21 and forcing Equation 5.20 to comply with a C6 density 0.86 times the density of 
the total C7+ fraction.

The recurrence formula Γ(x + 1) = xΓ(x) is used for x > 1. The coefficients a1 to a8 can be seen 
in Table 5.7.
To find the total mole fraction of the components with a molecular weight in the interval from M1
to M2, the probability function in Equation 5.23 must be integrated from M1 to M2 and multiplied 
by the total mole fraction of components with a molecular weight > η.
The distribution function used by Whitson may at first hand appear to be quite different from that 
of Pedersen et al. (Equation 5.10). In fact, the two distribution functions are closely related, which 
can be seen by assuming α = 1 in Equation 5.23. With this assumption, the equation reduces to

If the molecular weight is assumed to increase linearly with carbon number as expressed in

where Con1 and Con2 are constants. This relation is equivalent to Equation 5.10. Whitson uses α as

logarithmic molar distribution with that of a gamma distribution with α = 2.27. Extended composi￾tional analyses (Pedersen et al. 1992) and the theory of chemical reaction equilibria (Sørensen et al. 
2013) support the logarithmic distribution expressed in Equation 5.10 and gives no justification of 
Equation 5.23 with α ≠ 1. This is consistent with work of Zuo and Zhang (2000), who have reviewed 
the two characterization procedures.
Which molar distribution function to use was a hot topic in the 1980s, when many compositional 
analyses stopped at C7+ or C10+ and compositional analyzes to higher carbon numbers than C20+ were 
rare. Most compositional analyses newer than the year 2010 extends to C36+, and this has made the 
discussion of molar distribution functions less relevant, as a measured composition is always prefer￾able to an estimated one.
The most frequently used C7+ characterization methods describe a reservoir fluid as a continuous 
distribution. In the 1980s, this inspired researchers to propose that phase equilibrium calculations 
on petroleum reservoir fluids should use a continuous distribution instead of splitting the C7+ frac￾tion into pseudocomponents (e.g. Cotterman and Prausnitz 1985). This idea has not gained traction 
in the oil industry because a continuous distribution is not preserved after a flash calculation if the 
fluid splits into two or more phases. After the flash calculation each phase composition must be 
recharacterized, which means that the recombined phase compositions will differ from the feed 
composition.
5.2 BINARY INTERACTION COEFFICIENTS
To determine parameter a in a cubic equation of state, for example, the SRK or PR equation, it is 
necessary to know a binary interaction parameter, kij, for each binary component pair, that is, for 
any components i and j. The mixing rule used for parameter a can be seen from Equations 4.32 
and 4.34. kij is zero by definition for i = j. Figure 5.7 illustrates the consideration behind the assign￾ment of a binary interaction parameters to pairs of two different components. For a hydrocarbon, 
for example, C1 it makes little difference for the intermolecular attraction whether the neighboring 
molecule is another C1 molecule or a hydrocarbon (HC) with more carbon atoms, for example, nC4. 
kij = 0 is therefore an appropriate value not only for a C1–C1 pair but also for C1–nC4 and for other 
HC-HC pairs. The attraction between two CO2 molecules is high. If kij = 0 were also used for a 
CO2-HC pair, part of the strong attraction between two CO2 molecules would incorrectly also be 
attributed to the CO2-HC interaction. To dampen the attraction between CO2 and a HC molecule,

kij > 0 is used. Also for pairs of other non-hydrocarbons and HC, it may be appropriate to use 
kij > 0. The nonhydrocarbons contained in petroleum reservoir fluids are usually limited to N2, CO2, 
and H2S. It can further be of interest to consider H2O. Only for binaries comprising at least one of 
these components is it necessary in general to work with nonzero binary interaction coefficients. 
Nonzero binary interaction coefficients between pairs of hydrocarbons are, however, often used for 
regression (parameter fitting) purposes. The nonzero binary interaction coefficients recommended 
for use with the SRK and PR equations can be seen in Table 4.2. Interaction parameters for mixtures 
with water are dealt with in Chapter 16.
5.3 LUMPING
Table 5.8 shows the composition in Table 5.4 after characterization. The characterized mixture 
consists of more than 80 components and pseudocomponents. It is desirable to reduce this number 
before performing phase equilibrium calculations. Lumping consists of the following:
• Deciding what carbon number fractions to lump (group) into the same pseudocomponent
• Averaging Tc, Pc, and ω of the individual carbon number fractions to one Tc, Pc, and ω rep￾resentative for the whole lumped pseudocomponent
Pedersen et al. (1984) recommend a weight-based lumping where each lumped pseudocompo￾nent contains approximately the same weight amount and where Tc, Pc, and ω of the pseudocompo￾nents are found as weight mean averages of Tc, Pc, and ω of the individual carbon number fractions.

where zi
 is the mole fraction and Mi
 the molecular weight of carbon number fraction i. The weight￾based procedure ensures that all hydrocarbon segments of the C7+ fraction are given equal impor￾tance. An example of this grouping is given in Table 5.9. The C7+ fraction is divided into three 
groups, which on a weight basis are of approximately equal sizes. The weight percentages of the 
three C7+ pseudocomponents differ slightly because the cut points are made between the carbon 
number fractions. In Table 5.9, the entire C11 fraction is thus found in the first of the three C7+ pseu￾docomponents, although it would have given a more equal weight distribution had C11 been divided 
between the first and the second pseudocomponent.
Several other lumping schemes have been proposed in the literature. Instead of working with 
pseudocomponents of equal weight amounts, Danesh et al. (1992) suggested that the sum of the 
mole fractions times the logarithm of the molecular weight ( z lnM ) i i £ should be the same for each 
pseudocomponent. Whitson et  al. (1989) have proposed picking the pseudocomponents using a

quadrature method. This essentially means that each pseudocomponent contains a wider range 
of molecular weights and that components with the same molecular weight may be distributed 
between more pseudocomponents.
Leibovici (1993) have suggested that the equation of state parameters, a and b, of the total mix￾ture should be unaffected by lumping. The conventional mixing rule for parameter a is expressed 
in Equation 4.32. By introducing the expression for aij (Equation 4.34), parameter a for a mixture 
may be expressed as

where C1 and C2 are constants, Tc critical temperature, Pc critical pressure, and z mole fraction. If 
some of the N components are lumped into pseudocomponents, parameters a and b of the total mix￾ture will not in general be unaffected. The lumping procedure proposed by Leibovici et al. retains 
approximately the same mixture parameters after lumping. Say pseudocomponent k consists of the 
components m to n. To retain the same a and b of the total mixture, a and b of the pseudocomponent 
must be given by

By elimination of Pck, Equations 5.38 and 5.39 are easily reduced to an equation with Tck as 
the only unknown, allowing Tck and (subsequently) Pck to be determined. Next, the temperature 
dependence of the parameter α is to be determined. All the parameters on the right-hand side of 
Equation 5.37 are known, making it possible to calculate numerical values of αk(T) for a series 
of temperature values. The numerical values are fitted to a fourth-degree polynomial in T, and 
this polynomial is used as the temperature dependence of α in phase equilibrium calculations for 
pseudocomponent k.
Using this lumping procedure, the mixture a parameter for a single-phase system will be inde￾pendent of the number of pseudocomponents. In a calculation involving two or more phases, the 
calculation results will be independent of the number of pseudocomponents only if the individual 
components making up a pseudocomponent split equally (with the same K-factors) between the two 
phases. This will seldom be the case.
Lomeland and Harstad (1995) have presented a lumping scheme which minimizes the variation 
in the equation of state parameters a and b within a pseudocomponent. Newley and Merrill (1989) 
have suggested a somewhat similar lumping scheme which minimizes the variation in K-factors 
defined in Equation 5.40 rather than the variation in the equation of state parameters.
5.4 DELUMPING
Compositional reservoir simulation studies are often quite time consuming, and the simulation time 
increases with the number of components. Compositions used in compositional reservoir simula￾tion studies are therefore often heavily lumped. Also, some of the defined components are usually 
lumped in a compositional reservoir simulation. Table 5.10 shows the composition in Table 5.4 after 
characterization and lumping into a total of six pseudocomponents. N2 and C1 are lumped together, 
CO2 is lumped with C2–C3, and all the C4–C6 components are lumped into one fraction. The C7+
fractions are lumped in the same manner as in Table 5.9.
In a process plant separating a produced well stream into gas and oil, the pressure is usually 
much lower than in the reservoir. A lumping that was justified for reservoir conditions is not neces￾sarily justified for process conditions. It would therefore be interesting with a procedure which in 
a meaningful manner could split a lumped composition from a compositional reservoir simulation 
into its original constituents. Such a split is called delumping.
In a pressure-temperature flash for a hydrocarbon mixture, the relative molar amounts of a com￾ponent i ending up in the gas and liquid phases are determined by the K-factor of each component:

where yi
 is the mole fraction of component i in the gas phase and xi
 the mole fraction of component 
i in the liquid phase. If two components i and j have approximately the same K-factor, it is justified 
to lump them together to one pseudocomponent before performing the flash. The K-factor of the 
lumped component will be approximately the same as the K-factors of the two components treated 
individually.
A number of papers deal with delumping alternating with flash calculations as a way of speeding 
up flash calculations (Drohm and Schlijper 1985; Danesh et al. 1992; Leibovici et al. 1996). These 
flash calculations are carried out for a heavily lumped fluid and the resulting phase compositions 
delumped after each flash calculation using an appropriate K-factor correlation. It is questionable 
whether that will save any computation time as compared to carrying out the flash calculation with 
the full component number using an efficient flash algorithm (dealt with in Chapter 6). Furthermore, 
the delumping will inevitably introduce inaccuracies.
5.5 MIXING OF MULTIPLE FLUIDS
There is often a need to mix a number of reservoir fluid compositions into one. This is, for example, 
the case when multiple fluids are let to the same process plant. When representing the mixed stream, 
one may either work with a weaved composition where the pseudocomponents of each stream are 
retained or with a truly mixed composition. The difference between a weaved and a mixed composi￾tion is here exemplified for the two reservoir fluids in Tables 3.6 and 5.11. These are to be weaved or 
mixed in equal molar amounts. The weaved composition is shown in Table 5.12. The two composi￾tions have initially been characterized individually. For both fluids, the C7+ fraction is represented 
using three pseudocomponents. As is seen in Table 5.12, the pseudocomponent properties differ 
between the two fluids. In the weaved composition, the molar amounts of the defined components 
have been obtained as a simple average of the molar concentrations of these compounds in each 
individual composition. The weaved composition contains all the pseudocomponents found in each 
of the two compositions. Weaving of fluids is advantageous when it is essential to keep track of com￾ponents from individual feed streams in a mixed composition but is impractical when the number of

fluids to be weaved is high. For each new fluid, the number of components increases by the number 
of pseudocomponents found in that particular fluid. In such a case, it is more attractive to carry out 
a mixing of the individual compositions. This means that the mixed fluid is represented through 
pseudocomponents representative of the mixed fluid instead of having to work with all the pseudo￾components contained in each composition.
It is recommended to carry out the mixing before lumping into pseudocomponents. Say NFLUID

5.6 CHARACTERIZING OF MULTIPLE COMPOSITIONS 
TO THE SAME PSEUDOCOMPONENTS
In process simulations and compositional reservoir and flow simulations, it may be advanta￾geous to characterize a number of different reservoir fluids to a unique set of pseudocomponents 
(also called a Common EoS). This is practical, for example, when numerous process streams are 
let to the same separation plant. There is often a need to perform simulations on each stream 
separately as well as on the mixed stream. If each composition is represented using the same 
pseudocomponents, the streams can readily be mixed without having to increase the number of 
components.
Initially, the plus fractions of the compositions to be characterized to the same pseudocompo￾nents are split into carbon number fractions. For each C7+ carbon number fraction, Tc, Pc, and ω are 
estimated in the usual manner. The lumping uses the same cut points for all fluid compositions as 
sketched in Figure 5.8 and a common set of Tcs, Pcs, and ωs is determined for each fraction:

To decide what carbon number fractions to include in each pseudocomponent, an imaginary 
(mixed) molar composition is calculated that is assumed to be representative of all individual com￾positions. In this imaginary composition, (pseudo)component i enters with a mole fraction of

This imaginary composition is now treated like an ordinary composition to be lumped into 
pseudocomponents. The lumping determines the carbon number ranges and Tc, Pc, and ω of each 
pseudocomponent. The component properties of the lumped composition are assumed to apply for 
all the individual compositions. If the k-th pseudocomponent contains the carbon number fractions 
from m to n, the mole fraction of this pseudocomponent in the j-th composition will be

Table 5.14 shows the result of a characterization of the compositions in Tables 3.6 and 5.11 to the 
same pseudocomponents. The same weight has been applied to both fluids. This is why Tc, Pc, and 
ω are the same as when the two compositions are mixed in equal molar amounts. This can be seen 
by comparing the component properties in Tables 5.13 and 5.14.

5.7 HEAVY OIL COMPOSITIONS
A heavy oil is one of a high density at standard conditions, and the term heavy oil may be used for 
oil mixtures of an API gravity below 30. API is the density defined by the American Petroleum 
Institute as
API
SG = - 141 5 131 5 . . (5.55)
where SG is the 60°F/60°F specific gravity. Specific gravity is defined as the mass ratio of equal 
volumes of oil and water at the appropriate temperature. As the density of water at 60°F is close to 
1 g/cm3, the specific gravity of an oil sample at atmospheric conditions will take approximately the 
same value as the density of the oil in g/cm3.
Heavy oils will have a high content of aromatic components and a non-negligible content of 
components heavier than C80. The melting temperatures of aromatics are lower than of normal and 
slightly branched paraffins of approximately the same molecular weight. At low temperature, solid 
wax consisting of heavy paraffins is likely to form from a fluid rich in paraffins (see Chapter 11). 
Had those paraffins stayed in solution in the oil, the oil viscosity might have become very high. In 
heavy oils dominated by aromatics, high-molecular-weight compounds are kept in solution even at 
low temperatures, and the viscosity of heavy oil mixtures can be very high indeed at production 
conditions and even at reservoir conditions, as is further dealt with in Chapter 10.
Table 5.15 shows a reservoir oil composition with an API gravity of 28. This oil is at the very light 
end of what is classified as a heavy oil. Figure 5.9 shows a plot of the C7+ mole percentages (logarith￾mic scale) versus carbon number for the reservoir fluid in Table 5.15. As is indicated by the dashed 
line, an approximately linear relation is seen consistent with Equation 5.10. As will be shown in the 
next section, biodegradation may cause heavy oils not to exhibit the linear trend all the way from C7.
Table 5.16 shows a heavy oil composition with an API of 15.7. The C7+ molecular weight is 450. 
If the C7–C35 molecular weights in Table 2.3 are representative for this fluid, the C36+ molecular 
weight would be 808, corresponding to a C57 compound. By assuming that ln(mol%) versus carbon

number exhibits a linear trend from C35, the content of components heavier than C80 can be esti￾mated to be 3.2 mole percent, corresponding to 15.1% by weight. The properties of a heavy oil may 
be influenced by components as heavy as C200. The expression for m in Equation 5.3 is inappropriate 
components heavier than around C80. The functional forms of Equations 5.1 and 5.2 can be retained 
for Tc and Pc, and the coefficients in Table 5.3 in the expressions for Tc can be retained for both the

required for SRK, while the coefficients in Table 5.3 can be retained for PR. The following expres￾sion may be used for the acentric factor of a heavy oil

where ρ is density in g/cm3
 and M is molecular weight. The coefficients c1–c4, d1–d5, and e1–e4 for 
use with heavy oil mixtures can be seen in Table 5.17. Figure 5.10 shows the phase envelope of the oil 
mixture in Table 5.16 simulated using the Peng–Robinson equation of state with the fluid characterized 
using the heavy oil characterization outlined in this section. The phase envelope has a relatively flat sec￾tion connecting the low- and high-temperature parts of the phase envelope. This is typical for a heavy oil.
5.7.1 Biodegraded Oils
Table 5.18 shows an example of a heavy oil composition that almost lacks hydrocarbons from C3
to C6 and further has a relatively low concentration of hydrocarbons from C7 to C17. This is an 
example of a biodegraded oil. Biodegradation occurs when bacteria, fungi, or other organisms 
consume paraffinic components. Up to C6, most hydrocarbons are n-paraffins. The fractions C7
and heavier contain naphthenic or aromatic hydrocarbons in addition to paraffins, which are com￾pounds not degraded by biological organisms. Therefore, as is the case for the oil in Table 5.18, 
the components C2–C6 may be almost absent, while components from C7 to about C17, thanks 
to aromatics and naphthenes, are still present, although in low concentrations. The mentioned 
component classes are introduced in Chapter 1. Paraffins heavier than C17 are not subject to

biodegradation. Figure 5.11 shows a plot of the C7+ mole percentages (logarithmic scale) versus 
carbon number for the reservoir fluid in Table 5.18. Due to the biodegradation, the usual linear 
progression is not seen from C7 to C17, but the linear relationship is still there for the heavier 
hydrocarbons. For such a composition, it is essential to have a compositional analysis for at least 
C20+, as extrapolation from C7+ or C10+ would give an incorrect picture of how the components in 
the plus fraction are distributed.
5.8 PC-SAFT CHARACTERIZATION PROCEDURE
The PC-SAFT EoS model presented in Section 4.9 uses three component parameters:
• number of segments (m)
• segment diameter (σ)
• segment energy (ε).
The PC-SAFT component parameters are not uniquely tied to the physical behavior of a com￾ponent as is the case with Tc, Pc, and ω in a cubic equation of state. Gross and Sadowski (2001) 
have for defined components determined m, σ, and ε as a best fit to density and saturation pressure 
data. These values can be seen in Table 5.19 together with the PC-SAFT values for nC7, c-C6, and 
benzene.
Tybjerg and Pedersen (2017) have presented the PC-SAFT characterization procedure described 
in the following, which is a further development of the PC-SAFT characterization procedure of 
Pedersen et al. (2012). For a given component class of the C7+ components (Paraffins (P), Naphthenes 
(N), and Aromatics (A)), the ε-value for the relevant C7 component in Table 5.19 is used independent

of molecular weight; that is, the ε-value for n-heptane is used for all C7+ paraffins, the ε-value for 
cyclo-hexane for all naphthenes, and the ε-value for benzene for all aromatics. It is further assumed 
that m increases linearly with carbon number and is to match the m-values of the C7 components in 
Table 5.19 for a molecular weight of 96. The values used for m and ε for the P, N, and A fractions of 
the C7+ components are shown in Table 5.20.
The m and ε parameters of carbon number fraction i are found as average values of the param￾eters for the P, N and A component classes:
m P i P = fraction i( )x + m N i N fraction( )i mx +i A A fraction i( )xm i
_ _ _ (5.57)
E E E E i P P f i Ni Ai = raction i( )x + N fraction i( )x + A fraction i( )x _ _ _ (5.58)
The parameter σ of each lumped pseudocomponent is found to match density at atmospheric 
pressure and 15°C. The binary interaction parameters in Table 4.2 used with cubic equations are 
also found to be appropriate for the PC-SAFT equation.
Table 5.21 shows how m and ε are calculated for a C9 fraction of a molecular weight of 126.885 
with the PNA distribution also given in Table 5.21. The PNA distribution is found using the proce￾dure of Nes and Westerns (1951).
The reservoir fluid composition in Table 5.22 has been characterized for the PC-SAFT equation 
using the method of Tybjerg and Pedersen. The plus fraction is split, as suggested by Pedersen et al. 
(1992), and the C7+ fractions were lumped into 12 pseudocomponents. The characterized fluid is 
shown in Table 5.23 and the binary interaction parameters in Table 5.24.

Flash and Phase Envelope 
Calculations
Figure 6.1 illustrates a two-phase pressure–temperature (PT)-flash process. A feed stream consist￾ing of a mixture of N components is led to a flash separator kept at a constant temperature and pres￾sure. Two phases are present in the separator. The gas is let out at the top and the oil at the bottom. 
If P, T, and component mole fractions in the feed (z1, z2, . . . , zN) are known, a flash calculation will 
provide the following results:
1. Number of phases.
2. Molar amounts of each phase. Figure 6.1 uses the term β for the vapor mole fraction.
3. Molar compositions of each phase. In Figure 6.1, the component mole fractions in the gas 
phase are called (y1, y2, . . . , yN), and the component mole fractions in the liquid phase are 
called (x1, x2, . . . , xN).
As is shown in Equation A.36 in Appendix A, the following relations apply for two phases in 
equilibrium:

With T and P fixed, the number of variables is also (N + 1), these being (K1, K2, . . . , KN) and 
β. Before solving Equations 6.7 and 6.8, it is necessary to make sure that there are really two 
phases present and not just a single gas or a single liquid (oil) phase. The solution of the two equa￾tions is further complicated by the fact that the fugacity coefficients entering into Equation 6.7 are 
functions of the phase compositions resulting from the flash calculation, meaning that the fugacity 
coefficients have to be determined in an iterative manner. Before dealing with the flash problem in 
general, some simplified cases will be considered.
6.1 PURE COMPONENT VAPOR PRESSURES FROM 
CUBIC EQUATIONS OF STATE
Neglecting solid states, a pure component will either form a single-phase gas, a single-phase liquid, 
or a gas and a liquid phase in equilibrium. For a given temperature, two phases in equilibrium can 
only exist at the pure component vapor pressure. Vapor pressure curves of methane and benzene 
can be seen from Figure 1.2. At this pressure, the chemical potential (defined in Appendix A) of the 
component (called “i” here) is the same in the vapor (V) as in the liquid (L) state:
u u i

L = (6.9)
For a pure component, equality in chemical potentials also means equality in fugacity coefficients:

L = (6.10)
Fugacity coefficient expressions for the SRK and PR equations are shown in Equations 4.64 
and 4.65.162 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
Pure component vapor pressures may be determined from a cubic equation of state, but in an 
iterative manner. Figure 6.2 shows gas and liquid Z factor roots for ethane calculated for a tempera￾ture of 244 K using the Soave–Redlich–Kwong equation of state. The Z factor roots are calculated 
from Equation 4.30 solving for the higher (vapor) and lower (liquid) roots. The vapor Z factor curve 
reaches a maximum at a pressure around 21 bar, indicating that the polynomial in Z has only one 
real root for higher pressures. The vapor pressure must be found somewhere in the pressure interval 
for which the compressibility factor polynomial of Equation 4.30 has at least two real roots. It would 
otherwise be impossible to assign compressibility factors to both phases present at vapor pressure 
conditions.
Figure 6.3 shows a plot of the fugacity coefficients corresponding to the Z factors in Figure 6.2. 
Following Equation 6.10, the pure component vapor pressure may in Figure 6.3 be identified as the

pressure for which the liquid and vapor fugacity coefficients are equal, that is, as the point of inter￾section between the (full drawn line) liquid and (dashed line) vapor curves. The two curves intersect 
at a pressure of approximately 11 bar, which is therefore the vapor pressure. This pressure is indi￾cated with a dashed line in Figure 6.2. The part of the liquid Z factor curve in Figure 6.2, which is 
below the vapor pressure line, does not represent a real physical state. The same applies to the part 
of the vapor Z factor curve above the vapor pressure line. The part of the vapor Z factor curve below 
the vapor pressure represents a state of undersaturated gas and the part of the liquid Z factor curve 
above the vapor pressure a state of undersaturated liquid.
For a saturation point algorithm to be efficient, it is essential to have a reasonable first estimate 
of the vapor pressure, or at least a pressure estimate for which the polynomial in Z in Equation 4.30 
has two real roots. This is needed to be able to compare the fugacity coefficients of the liquid and 
vapor roots. The correlation of Dong and Lienhard (1986) may be used to provide an initial guess 
on the reduced vapor pressure Pr

6.2 MIXTURE SATURATION POINTS FROM CUBIC EQUATIONS OF STATE
If a single component is not at its vapor pressure, only one phase exists at equilibrium. With two 
or more components present, the determination of the number of phases is less trivial because the 
equilibrium phase compositions are unknown. Before considering the general PT-flash problem, the 
problem of locating mixture saturation pressures is first to be considered. For a mixture initially in 
liquid form, the saturation point pressure is detected as a pressure at which the first gas bubble is 
seen to form in the liquid. A saturation point of a liquid is therefore also called a bubble point. For 
a mixture initially in gaseous form, the saturation point is the pressure at which the first liquid drop 
is formed. The saturation point of a gas is therefore also known as a dew point. As compared to the 
general PT-flash calculation, bubble and dew point calculations are simpler, in the sense that one of 
the equilibrium phases equals the feed composition.
At the bubble point pressure, the vapor mole fraction β equals zero, and Equation 6.8 can be 
simplified to

The liquid phase equals the feed composition and an initial estimate of the vapor phase compo￾sition at the bubble point may be obtained from Equation 6.5 with K-factors from Equation 6.13.
The bubble point pressure may be determined by following the iterative scheme in Table 6.1.
Bubble and dew points may also be calculated for a specified pressure, in which case the tem￾perature is the unknown parameter to be determined. A dew point temperature may be calculated 
as outlined in Table 6.2.164 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

Though in principle simpler than PT-flash calculations, bubble and dew point calculations are 
complicated by the fact that it is not generally known in advance whether the mixture considered 
really has a bubble or a dew point at the specified P or T. Figure 1.6 shows a phase envelope for a 
natural gas mixture. The bubble point line ends in the critical point (CP) at a temperature of around 
−60°C. A bubble point calculation for a higher temperature should therefore give the answer that no 
bubble point can be located. It can, however, be quite hard to distinguish cases with no saturation 
point from cases for which the saturation point calculation is causing numerical problems.
Figure 1.6 also reveals that the natural gas considered has two dew point pressures in a tempera￾ture interval above the critical temperature. This may cause convergence problems in a saturation Flash and Phase Envelope Calculations 165
point calculation, and either the upper or lower dew point will be located, at best. A phase envelope 
calculation as outlined in Section 6.5 will track all the saturation points existing for a given tem￾perature or pressure.
6.3 FLASH CALCULATIONS
Michelsen and Mollerup (2007) have given a very thorough description of flash calculation tech￾niques. They have also dealt with how to derive the thermodynamic quantities and derivatives 
needed to make a flash algorithm fast and robust.
6.3.1 Stability Analysis
A flash calculation presents the problem that the number of phases is generally not known in 
advance. An important element of a flash calculation is therefore the determination of the number 
of phases present. This may be accomplished by carrying out a stability analysis (Michelsen 1982a).
As explained in Appendix A, a closed system will try to arrange its molecules in the position 
that minimizes its Gibbs free energy, G. Consider two samples of pure components, named 1 and 2, 
being introduced into a closed cell kept at a fixed pressure and temperature. The two samples will 
mix if the mixing process leads to a decrease in G. Figure 6.4 exemplifies ΔG of mixing (ΔGmix) for 
a binary mixture. If the two substances are miscible in all proportions, the ΔG of the mixing curve 
may look like the one marked I. For a zero-mole fraction of component 1, the “mixture” will consist 
of pure 2, and the ΔG of mixing will be zero. With component 1 introduced in a nonzero amount, 
the ΔG of mixing will initially decrease and subsequently pass through a minimum. For pure com￾ponent 1, the ΔG of mixing is again zero. Consider a mixture with a mole fraction of component 1 
equal to x1
m . Imagine that this mixture splits into two phases, A and B, in which the mole fractions 
of component 1 are x1
A and x1
B , respectively. After this phase split, the total system will have a ΔG 
of mixing determined by the intersection between a vertical line through x1
m (not shown in figure) 
and the dashed line connecting A and B on curve I. This phase split will lead to an increase in ΔG 
of mixing and will therefore not take place. The mixture is said to be stable. This will be true for 
any mixture on curve I.

The curve marked II illustrates a situation with limited miscibility between the two substances. 
Consider again a mixture with a mole fraction of component 1 equal to x1
m . Imagine that this mix￾ture splits into two phases, A and B, and that the mole fractions of component 1 in the two phases 
are x1
A and x1
B
, respectively. Similar to the situation on curve I, after the phase split, the total system 
will have a ΔG of mixing determined by the intersection point between a vertical line through x1
m
and the dashed line connecting A and B on curve II. In this case, the phase split leads to a decrease 
in ΔG of mixing. In other words, a mixture with the mole fraction of component 1 equal to x1
m will 
spontaneously split into two separate phases, A and B. The mole fraction of component 1 in the two 
phases will be x1
A and x1
B
, respectively. The mixture is said to be unstable. The ratio

This relation will only be true in general if the chemical potentials of the two components are 
the same in positions A and B. Equality in the chemical potentials of each component implies phase 
equilibrium, and it can be concluded that two phases in equilibrium are located on the common 
tangent to the ΔG of mixing curve.
This observation may be generalized to a criterion saying that a mixture will remain single phase 
(be stable) if the tangent to the ΔG of mixing curve in the point of the feed composition does not 
intersect the ΔG of mixing curve anywhere. If it intersects the ΔG of mixing curve, two or more 
phases will be present.
Figure 6.5 shows a phase envelope for a mixture consisting of 40 mole percentage methane (C1) 
and 60 mole percentage carbon dioxide (CO2). The phase envelope is calculated using the Soave–
Redlich–Kwong equation of state (Equation 4.20). From Figures 6.6 through 6.8, it is possible to 
study the ΔG of mixing for this system at different conditions. Figure 6.6 shows ΔGmix for −42°C

and 20 bar. From the phase envelope in Figure 6.5, it is seen that the mixture at these conditions 
will split into two phases. A PT-flash calculation for −42°C and 20 bar gives the results presented 
in Table 6.3. The methane mole fractions contained in the liquid and gas phases in Table 6.3 are 
seen to be identical to the methane mole fractions in Figure 6.6, for which the ΔGmix curve has a 
common tangent. It is further possible to conclude from Figure 6.6 that a binary mixture of C1 and 
CO2 containing more than approximately 49 mole percentage of methane will be single phase at 
−42°C and 20 bar. For higher C1 mole fractions, the tangents to the ΔGmix curve will not intersect 
with the curve.
Figure 6.7 shows the ΔG of mixing curve of C1–CO2 mixtures for −30°C and 26 bar. The tangent 
to the curve for a C1 mole fraction of 0.40 (~40 mole percentage) does not intersect the curve any￾where, indicating that a considered mixture is single phase at these conditions. This is in accordance 
with the phase envelope in Figure 6.5.
Figure 6.8 shows the ΔG of mixing curve of C1–CO2 mixtures for −7.6°C and 90 bar, at which 
conditions a mixture of 40 mole percentage of C1 and 60 mole percentage of CO2 is at its critical 
point (CP). The ΔGmix is very flat in the vicinity of a C1 mole fraction of 0.40 and almost coincides 
with the tangent to the curve in this point. At the CP, the gas and liquid phases become equal. When 
approaching the CP from the two-phase side, the two minima in the ΔGmix curve such as those in 
Figure 6.6 will approach each other and finally merge right in the CP. When moving away from the 
CP on the single-phase side, the flat part of the ΔG of mixing curve will gradually become more 
rounded and take a shape similar to that in Figure 6.7.

The stability analysis as outlined in the preceding text for a binary mixture can be extended to 
multicomponent mixtures. For a multicomponent mixture, the ΔG of mixing curve will change to a 
ΔG of mixing surface and the tangent line to a tangent plane. A mixture will remain single phase if 
the tangent plane to the ΔG of mixing surface in the point of a molar composition does not intersect 
the ΔG of mixing surface anywhere. Intersection with the ΔG of mixing surface indicates the pres￾ence of two or more phases. Consider the tangent plane to the ΔG of mixing surface in the point of a 
feed molar composition equal to (z1, z2, . . . , zN). The distance (tangent plane distance or TPD) from 
this plane to the ΔG of mixing surface evaluated for a trial y-phase (y1, y2, . . . , yN) equals

If the tangent plane distance is non-negative for all possible trial phases (y1, y2, . . . , yN), the feed 
mixture will only form one phase. If on the other hand a trial phase can be located that gives a nega￾tive value of TPD, the mixture will split into two or more phases.
6.3.2 Solving the Flash Equations
If the stability analysis reveals that two phases are present, the ratios between the component mole 
fractions in the trial phase (y1, y2, . . . , yN) and in the feed mixture (z1, z2, . . . , zN) may be used as 
an initial estimate of the K-factors. The Rachford–Rice equation

Having determined β corresponding to the assumed K-factors, new estimates of the phase mole 
fractions may be determined from Equations 6.5 and 6.6. The fugacity coefficients of these com￾positions are determined from the cubic equation of state, and a new K-factor estimate is obtained 
from Equation 6.4. A new β is determined using Equations 6.22 through 6.24. The successive sub￾stitution outlined here can be quite time consuming, especially for near-critical mixtures, that is, 
mixtures for which all the K-factors approach 1. Convergence may be accelerated as outlined by 
Michelsen (1982b, 1998).
For some systems, as outlined by Heidemann and Michelsen (1995), successive substitution may 
also lead to convergence problems, and different techniques must be applied. Successive substitu￾tion is, for example, inappropriate when gas hydrate phases are to be considered. Gas hydrate flash 
techniques will be further dealt with in Chapter 14.
Much computer time can be saved in a two-phase flash calculation using a cubic equation of state 
with all binary interaction coefficients set to zero. Irrespective of the number of components, a flash 
calculation with no nonzero interaction parameters can be reduced to involve only three parameters 
(Pedersen et al. 1985; Michelsen 1986a). Time can also be saved by dividing the component pairs 
into those with kij = 0 and those with kij ≠ 0 (Hendriks 1987; Jensen and Fredenslund 1987).
In transient compositional simulations, as in reservoir simulations or in dynamic flow or process 
simulations, the flash calculation time can be reduced considerably by taking advantage of the fact 
that phase compositions may only change moderately in time and position. Suppose the flash result 
at position x is a single-phase liquid at time t, and the liquid is highly undersaturated. Unless pres￾sure, temperature, or composition change substantially from time t to t + Δt, it is unlikely that a gas 
phase will be present at position x at time t + Δt. Rasmussen et al. (2006) have suggested a proce￾dure for keeping track of the degree of undersaturation, and as long as the system is clearly single 
phase, the fairly time-consuming stability analysis can be skipped. Rasmussen et al. also outline 
procedures for saving computation time in the two-phase region by using the flash result from the 
previous time step as initial estimate.
6.3.3 Multiphase PT-Flash
The stability analysis outlined in Section 6.3.1 may be extended to test for the possible presence 
of three or more phases (Michelsen 1982a). The complexity of the stability analysis is somewhat 
increased when more than two phases are to be considered. The upper part of Figure 6.9 shows a 
system that, as an anticipated single phase, has liquid-like properties and a Gibbs free energy of G0. 
The system may be checked for stability by splitting off a vapor phase. If the total Gibbs energy of 
the system can be reduced by splitting the mixture into a gas–liquid system (G′ < G0), the correct 
flash solution will consist of two or more phases. In a multiphase flash calculation, the stability 
analysis is continued to look for a second liquid phase, which may reveal that Gibbs energy can 
be further reduced by splitting the mixture into a gas–liquid–liquid system (G″ < G′). It could also 
be that a liquid–liquid system with no gas phase would have an even lower Gibbs energy. This is 
investigated as part of a multiphase flash calculation but not dealt with in Figure 6.9. The stability 
analysis may be continued searching for a third liquid phase, and so on. As indicated in Figure 6.9, 
the fourth phase could also be a solid phase—for example, solid wax, as is further dealt with in 
Chapter 11. A solid phase will form if this reduces the Gibbs free energy as compared with the 
three-phase solution (G′′′ < G″). The lower part of Figure 6.9 illustrates a similar series of stability 
analyses starting with a mixture, which as a single phase has vapor-like properties.Flash and Phase Envelope Calculations 171
The calculation time needed for multiphase flash calculations may be reduced if, for example, 
it is known that one of the phases is likely to be aqueous. The upper part of Figure 6.10 shows a 
mixture of hydrocarbon and water (aqueous). An initial stability analysis has revealed that a water￾rich liquid phase will split off. As a single phase, the remaining hydrocarbon mixture has liquid￾like properties. If no other phases are considered than one vapor, one hydrocarbon liquid, and one 
aqueous phase, all that is needed in Figure 6.10 is a stability analysis for a possible hydrocarbon 
vapor phase. If the Gibbs free energy (G′) of the three-phase system is lower than that of the two￾phase system (G0), the flash solution is a three-phase system. The lower part of Figure 6.10 shows a 
mixture consisting of water and a vapor-like hydrocarbon mixture that is being tested for stability 
with respect to the precipitation of a liquid hydrocarbon phase. A flash calculation in which the 
phases considered are limited to gas, hydrocarbon liquid, and liquid aqueous water, and in which 
it is further assumed that only one phase of a given type can exist, is much simpler and therefore 
less time consuming than a general multiphase flash calculation. It is therefore recommended to 
take advantage of any previous knowledge about the system when designing or choosing the flash 
algorithm for a particular purpose.

In reservoir and process simulations, water-free oil and gas mixtures are usually regarded as 
systems that are unlikely to form more than two fluid phases. A multiphase flash algorithm may 
be used to investigate the validity of this assumption. Table 6.4 shows the composition of a light 
gas condensate. This gas condensate mixture was characterized for the PR equation using the char￾acterization procedure of Pedersen et al. in Chapter 5. The characterized composition is shown in 
Table 6.5. A multiphase flash calculation is performed using the PR equation of state. Table 6.6

mixture at these conditions splits into one gas phase and two liquid phases. A temperature as low 
as −72°C is usually not experienced during oil and gas production. The presence of a third phase at 
these conditions therefore has little practical importance. As is outlined in Section 6.5, the presence 
of a three-phase region does, however, have some implications for phase envelope calculations.
Lindeloff et al. (2013) have studied systems consisting of a Middle East oil mixed with CO2 at 
both reservoir temperature and lower temperatures. The oil composition is shown in Table 6.7. It 
was characterized for the SRK-Peneloux equation of state, and the characterized fluid composition 
is shown in Table 6.8 with nonzero binary interaction parameters in Table 6.9. Mixed with CO2 the 
fluid at a temperature of 26.7°C splits into three phases, two liquid phases and a gas phase. The 
experimental conditions and the experimental and simulated phase compositions can be seen in 
Table 6.10.
Reservoir simulation studies will usually only consider two non-aqueous phases, gas and oil. The 
existence of a third phase may disturb a PT-flash calculation carried out with a two-phase flash algo￾rithm. A two-phase algorithm will not search for a third phase. Once the stability analysis reveals Flash and Phase Envelope Calculations 175

that more than one phase exists, the algorithm will start looking for a two-phase solution, that is, a 
solution fulfilling Equation 6.1. Any such solution will be regarded as the correct one. For a mixture 
that actually forms three phases, there may be more than one solution to Equation 6.1, and the itera￾tion for a two-phase solution may lead to oscillations between two nearby phase compositions, both 
fulfilling Equation 6.1. If the flash algorithm converges to a result, it will be false.
Paterson et  al. (2018) have presented a multiflash algorithm based on the so-called RAND 
method, which is one well suited when not only phase equilibria but also chemical equilibria are to 
be considered.
6.3.4 Three Phase PT-Flash with a Pure Water Phase
Water is often present as a third phase during oil and gas production. The solubility of the gas and 
oil constituents in the water phase is usually quite limited. It is therefore often acceptable with an 
approximate PT-flash calculation considering the water phase to be pure water. In that case, the 
PT-flash calculation can be much simplified (Michelsen 1981) as compared with a general multi￾phase flash calculation, in which all components can be present in all phases. This is illustrated in 
Figure 6.11. It is similar to Figure 6.10, but the calculation is further simplified by not having to 
consider the solubility of other components in the water phase.
In a three-phase PT-flash with a check for pure water, the feed is initially assumed to form only 
one mixed phase (gas or oil with some dissolved water). It is tested whether pure water will sepa￾rate from this imaginary phase. This test is done by comparing the chemical potential of water in a 
pure water phase with the chemical potential of water in the feed. The expression for the chemical 
potential of pure water takes the form
( ) u u (ln ) u p (ln ln ( ) ) w pure w RT w pure w w pure =+ =+ f RT P + 0 0 (6.29)
and the chemical potential of water in the feed can be expressed as
( ) u u (ln ln(p ) ln ) w mix = + w w RT P z + + mix w

zw is the mole fraction of water in the total mixture. The terms chemical potential, fugacity, and 
fugacity coefficients are explained in Appendix A. A pure liquid water phase will precipitate if 
water has a lower chemical potential in pure form than mixed into the feed composition:

phase is found from the following equation:

The remaining water is found in a pure liquid water phase.

the mole fraction of water from Equation 6.33. If this mixture splits into two phases, the amount of

pure water is subsequently adjusted, considering that Equation 6.33 must be fulfilled for each mixed 
phase.
When a pure water phase does not separate from the feed mixture, that is, Equation 6.32 is not 
fulfilled, a usual two-phase flash calculation is performed on the total feed mixture. In each iterative 
step for the equilibrium phase compositions, it is checked whether a pure water phase will form.
6.3.5 Pure Inorganic Solids
Most reservoir fluids and natural gas mixtures contain carbon dioxide (CO2) and may also carry 
water (H2O). CO2, H2O and other inorganics may precipitate as pure solid phases if the fluid is 
cooled. The solid form of water is ice, but when gas components are present, water might instead 
form part of a gas hydrate structure as dealt with in Chapter 13.
To decide whether it is thermodynamically favorable for a pure component to be in liquid or solid 
form, one may consider the change in Gibbs free energy, G, as a result of the phase transition from 
solid to liquid form. If a pure component is in solid form at a given P and T but can reduce its G by 
melting (fusion), its thermodynamic equilibrium state will be liquid. If fusion makes G increase, it 
is thermodynamically favorable for the component to remain in solid form. No change in the Gibbs 
free energy by a possible fusion indicates that the liquid and solid states are equally favorable and 
that the component is right at its melting point. The following general thermodynamic relation 
exists for dG (combining Equations A.6 and A.7 in Appendix A):
dG dH = - TdS (6.34)
where dH and dS are the changes in enthalpy and entropy, respectively. Applied to the fusion of a 
pure component, this relation becomes
- = G H- - T S- f f f (6.35)
where the superscript f stands for fusion, ∆Hf is enthalpy (or heat) of fusion, and ∆Sf
 is entropy of 
fusion. If melting of the component takes place right at the melting temperature, where - = Gf 0, 
the entropy of fusion will be
- = - S H

An expression for the change in Gibbs free energy as a result of melting a pure component

 may be obtained by considering the hypothetical process sketched in 
Figure 6.12. The component considered is initially in the solid state, a, at the temperature, T. The 
component is to be converted to the liquid state, d, at the same temperature T. Instead of follow￾ing the path a –> d, it follows the path a –> b, b –> c, and finally c –> d. While the component is 
kept in a solid state, the temperature is initially changed to Tf
, which is associated with a change in 
enthalpy of

Phase equilibrium calculations require knowledge of component fugacities (f) or component 
fugacity coefficients ( ) ϕ . These terms are defined in Appendix A. For a pure component i, the 
change in Gibbs free energy is related to the change in fugacity through the relation (Equation A.23

CO2 is often used as injection gas for EOR purposes (Chapter 15). The gas produced from 
a field with CO2 gas injection will after some time be rich in CO2. One way to reduce the CO2
concentration in the gas could be to freeze the CO2 out. Table 6.12 shows a gas composition 
containing 50.42 mol% CO2 and the result of a PT flash calculation at 80 bar and −100°C. At 
these conditions a pure solid CO2 phase is formed, which is in equilibrium with a liquid phase 
with a CO2 mol% of 4.049. This is a reduction of the CO2 concentration in the fluent phase by 
more than a factor of 10.
6.3.6 Other Flash Specifications
P and T are not always the most convenient flash specification variables. Some of the processes 
taking place during oil and gas production are not at a constant P and T. Passage of a valve may, 
for example, be approximated as a constant enthalpy (H) process and a compression as a constant 
entropy (S) process. The temperature after a valve may, therefore, be simulated by initially perform￾ing a PT-flash at the conditions at the inlet to the valve. If the enthalpy is assumed to be the same 
at the outlet, the temperature at the outlet can be found from a PH-flash with P equal to the outlet 
pressure and H equal to the enthalpy at the inlet. A PT-flash followed by a PS-flash may similarly be 
used to determine an approximate temperature after a compressor. A VT-flash may be used to study 
how pressure varies with temperature in a closed system. It may, for example, be used to simulate 
the conditions in a pipeline during shutdown.
Figure 6.13 gives an overview of the application areas for four different flash specifications. The 
alternative flash specification variables (H, S, or V) may replace P and/or T in the flash calculation, 
or the flash calculation may be performed as an over iteration in a PT-flash. The latter means that 
P and/or T are guessed, and for each P and T, the solution is checked for correspondence with the 
flash specification variables. Michelsen (1999) has presented flash calculation techniques for use 
with alternative state function-based flash specification variables.

6.4 ALLOCATION CALCULATIONS
Flash calculations combined with the common EoS technology presented in Section 5.6 can be 
used in an allocation procedure that takes both process conditions and mixing effects into account. 
Allocation consists in calculating the volumetric contributions to the total gas and oil (liquid) pro￾duction at standard (or other reference) conditions from each of the well streams led to a process 
facility.
To quantify the volumetric contributions of each well stream, the partial molar volumes of each 
component in the gas and liquid product streams are needed. The partial molar volume, Vi , of com￾ponent i in a gas or a liquid phase is the contribution of component i to the overall molar volume, 
meaning that the overall molar volume can be written
V zi i V i
N
= E =1 (6.50)
where zi is the mole fraction of component i and N the number of components. The partial molar 
volume of component i in an ideal gas mixture equals the molar volume of the pure component i at 
the same conditions. For a non-ideal gas or a liquid mixture, the partial molar volume of component 
i can be found from

To exemplify allocation calculations, a case is considered where three well streams are processed 
through the same process plant, as sketched in Figure 6.14. A flowmeter measures the flow rate of 
each well stream. The fluid compositions and the mass, volumetric, and molar flow rates are shown 
in Table 6.13. Before the inlet to the process plant, the well streams are mixed in a manifold.

6.5 PHASE ENVELOPE CALCULATIONS
A phase envelope, as presented in Chapter 1, may, in principle, be calculated by performing a 
series of saturation point calculations as outlined in Section 6.2, but if the complete phase envelope 
is needed, this method is not to be recommended. It is both time consuming and likely to cause 
convergence problems at higher pressures and near the critical point (CP). The procedure outlined 
by Michelsen (1980) may be used instead. The phase envelope calculation is started at a moder￾ate pressure (<20 bar) from either the dew point or the bubble point side. At the starting pressure, 
the saturation point temperature is calculated as outlined in Section 6.2. Because the pressure is 
moderate, convergence is easily obtained. A second saturation pressure is calculated at a slightly 
higher pressure. The third point and subsequent saturation points are calculated making use of the 
K-factors, pressures, and temperatures in each of the two previous points on the phase envelope. 
This ensures a reasonable initial estimate and, using the procedure outlined by Michelsen, it cre￾ates no problems to locate and pass the CP. The CP may alternatively be located as described by 
Michelsen and Heidemann (1981).
Michelsen’s technique for construction of phase envelopes is not limited to dew and bubble 
point lines. It may also be used to construct inner lines in a phase envelope, that is, the PT values 
for which the vapor mole fraction equals a specified value. Figure 6.15 shows the phase envelope 
of the oil mixture in Table 6.20 calculated using the SRK equation of state. The characterized fluid 
composition is shown in Table 6.21. It is seen that the dew and bubble point lines as well as the inner 
lines meet at the CP at which the gas and liquid phases are indistinguishable and the vapor mole 
fraction β may therefore be assigned any value between 0 and 1.Flash and Phase Envelope Calculations 189

Figure 6.16 shows the results of phase envelope calculations performed for the gas condensate 
mixture in Table 6.5. No CP is located. This may at first sight look like a simulation failure but does 
in fact have a more sensible explanation. It has already been shown through the PT-flash results in 
Table 6.6 that the mixture considered forms three phases in a PT region at low temperatures. The 
three-phase area has been located (Michelsen 1986b) and is shown in Figure 6.16 and in an enlarged 
scale in Figure 6.17. This example illustrates the fact that a hydrocarbon mixture will not always 
have a CP.190 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

The oil mixture in Table 6.20 has been characterized for the SRK equation, and the character￾ized mixture is shown in Table 6.21. Figure 6.18 shows the phase envelope for a mixture of CO2
and the oil in Table 6.21 mixed in the molar ratio 2.50:1.0. It has a three-phase area of extending 
to temperature above 0°C. At a temperature of around 30°C, the phase boundary increases almost 
vertically in pressure. This is an indication of a liquid–liquid equilibrium at the low temperature 
side of the phase boundary. Table 6.22 shows the results of a PT-flash calculation for 900 bar and 
30°C. Two liquid phases of approximately the same composition are formed. The density is above 
0.9 g/cm3 for both phases.

(Robinson et al. 1981). As can be seen from the figure (solid circles), two CPs have been detected 
experimentally for this mixture. As can also be seen from the figure, the existence of two CPs 
is reproduced (solid squares) in a phase envelope calculation on the same mixture using the PR 
equation of state. The locations of the simulated CPs deviate slightly from those observed experi￾mentally but considering that a CP is surrounded by a region with near-critical phase behavior, the 
agreement is quite good.
Phase envelope calculations for mixtures containing water and possibly hydrate inhibitors are 
complicated by the fact that the hydrocarbon phase boundary may be quite affected by the presence 
of aqueous components and because an additional (aqueous) phase must be accounted for. Lindeloff 
and Michelsen (2003) have outlined a procedure for how to make phase envelope calculations for 
hydrocarbon–water mixtures. Chapter 16 shows examples of the application of this algorithm.
6.6 PHASE IDENTIFICATION
If a PT-flash calculation for an oil or gas mixture shows the presence of two phases, the one with 
lower density is usually assumed to be gas or vapor, and the one with higher density is assumed to be 
liquid or oil. In the case of a single-phase solution, it is less obvious whether to consider this single 
phase a gas or a liquid. No generally accepted definition exists to distinguish a gas from a liquid. 
Because the terms gas and oil are very much used in the oil industry, it is, however, of interest to try 
to establish a reasonable criterion for distinguishing between the two types of phases. Figure 6.20
shows the phase envelope of a volatile oil. Four single-phase conditions are marked on the figure 
(points 1 to 4). Point 1 is just outside the two-phase region on the bubble point side. Therefore, it is 
natural to classify the mixture at these conditions as being a liquid. Point 4 is also just outside the 
two-phase region but on the dew point side, suggesting that the mixture is gaseous at these condi￾tions. At the conditions of points 2 and 3, it is less obvious whether the mixture is to be considered 
a gas or a liquid. Point 2 is located at a temperature lower than the critical temperature. This could 
suggest that the mixture at point 2 is a liquid. Similarly, point 3 is at a temperature higher than the 
critical temperature, suggesting that the fluid in point 3 is a gas. This leads to the following sugges￾tion for a phase identification criterion (as illustrated in Figure 6.21).

2. If the pressure is higher than the critical pressure and the temperature higher than the criti￾cal temperature.194 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
This criterion has the disadvantage that the CP and possibly also the dew or bubble point tem￾perature at the actual pressure must be simulated. This is impractical when computation time mat￾ters. Therefore, it is often more convenient to work with a simpler criterion such as the following:
Liquid
V
b
< Const
Gas
V
b
> Const
V is the molar volume, b the b parameter of the cubic equation of state, and Const a constant, the 
value of which depends on the equation of state. For the SRK and PR equations presented in Chapter 
4, Const = 1.75 is a convenient choice.
As long as the thermodynamic model applied is the same, independent of phase type, (as is, e.g., 
the case with a cubic equation of state), the phase identification criterion has no importance for the 
simulated properties.

PVT Simulation
Before a characterized fluid composition is applied, for example, in compositional reservoir simula￾tion studies, it is recommended to perform PVT simulations and compare with measured PVT data. 
This can be seen as a final quality check (QC) of the fluid composition. The check can be performed 
by characterizing the fluid without any lumping of the components lighter than C7, and with the 
C7+ fraction lumped into 10–12 pseudocomponents using the method of Pedersen et al. described 
in Chapter 5. For an accurate plus composition, such fluid description will generally provide a 
good match of measured PVT data. Further lumping may be needed for the actual application. If 
this lumping deteriorates the match of the PVT data, regression may be performed, as outlined in 
Chapter 9.
If the initial fluid characterization fails to give the desired match of measured PVT data, the 
compositional analysis and the PVT data should be critically checked. An inaccurate plus molecular 
weight is a common source of error. Regression to measured PVT data as described in Chapter 9 
is an option if major deviations between measured and simulated PVT data persist after a critical 
evaluation analysis of the measured data. It is described in Section 2.2 how to QC a compositional 
analysis.
7.1 CONSTANT MASS EXPANSION
The constant mass expansion (CME) experiment is described in Section 3.1.1. Table 3.9 shows 
CME data for the gas condensate composition in Table 3.8. The composition is characterized for 
the Soave–Redlich–Kwong equation with temperature-dependent volume shift parameters. The 
property correlations in Equations 5.1 through 5.3 and the SRK coefficients in Table 5.3 have been 
used. Table 7.1 shows the characterized mixture lumped with a total of 22 components (10 defined 
components and 12 pseudocomponents). Lumping starts with C10. Each of C10+ fractions contains 
approximately the same weight amount. A carbon number fraction is not split between two pseu￾docomponents, which explains the slight variation in weight amounts of the various pseudocompo￾nents. Binary interaction coefficients are shown in Table 7.2. Table 7.3 shows the mixture lumped 
with a total of six pseudocomponents with binary interaction coefficients shown in Table 7.4. In 
this case, lumping starts with C7. Again, the cut points are selected to have approximately the same 
weight amount in each pseudocomponent. In Table 7.3, N2 and C1, as the two most volatile compo￾nents, have been lumped together. CO2 is less volatile and has been lumped with C2 and C3. Finally, 
the C4–C6 components have been lumped together.
Experimental and simulated CME results are plotted in Figures 7.1 through 7.3. Figure 7.1 shows 
relative volumes (total volume divided by saturation point volume), Figure 7.2 shows liquid volumes 
(liquid volume in percentage of saturation point volume), and Figure 7.3 shows gas-phase Z-factors 
(defined in Equation 3.2). Simulation results are shown for the mixture composition lumped to a 
total of 22 (pseudo)components (Tables 7.1 and 7.2) as well as for the mixture lumped to a total of 6 
pseudocomponents (Tables 7.3 and 7.4). The simulated relative volumes and the simulated Z-factors 
agree nicely with the experimental results, but some deviations are seen between the experimen￾tal and simulated liquid volumes. It is shown in Chapter 9 how the match can be improved by 
regression.
Table 3.5 shows CME data for the oil mixture in Table 3.6. The composition was characterized 
for the Soave–Redlich–Kwong and Peng–Robinson equations of state, and a constant (temperature 
independent) Peneloux volume shift parameter was used. The component properties in Table 7.5
were found using the property correlations in Equations 5.1 through 5.3 and the coefficients in

the PR–Peneloux equation than with the SRK–Peneloux equation. The compressibility is determined 
by the functional form of the equation of state, and it seldom makes sense to try to improve the match 
by regression to compressibility data.

* Molar compositions are shown for two different plus molecular weights (M+).
mixture composition is lumped to a total of 22 components and pseudocomponents. The simulated 
liquid dropout curve is shown as a dashed line in Figure 7.6. The general curvature agrees nicely 
with the experimental data, but the simulated saturation point (starting pressure for liquid dropout 
curve) is slightly too high. As was mentioned in Section 2.4.2.1, the plus molecular weight (M+) may 
be slightly inaccurate, which will result in an inaccurate molar composition because the composi￾tion is measured as a weight composition. Table 7.7 shows the measured weight composition (from 
Table 3.15) and the molar composition based on an M+ of 381.0 (measured value) and an M+ of 350.5. 
The latter M+ is 8% lower than the experimentally determined value, which percentage is not an 
unrealistic uncertainty for a plus molecular weight. Both molar compositions in Table 7.7 agree with 
the measured weight composition.
The adjustment of the plus molecular weight is illustrated graphically in Figure 7.7, which shows 
mole percentages of each C7+ fraction versus molecular weight. The mole percentages of C7–C19 are 
shown as circles in Figure 7.7. The dashed–dotted line shows the mole percentages of the fractions 
C20–C80 calculated from Equations 5.10 through 5.12, assuming a plus molecular weight (M+) of 
381.0 (measured value). The dashed line shows the mole percentages of the fractions C20–C80 calcu￾lated from Equations 5.10 through 5.12 but assuming that M+ is only 350.5, which is the molecular 
weight that makes the simulated saturation point agree with the measured value. As can be seen PVT Simulation 203

of 350.5 (dashed line).
from Figure 7.7, the line for M+ = 350.5 is in better agreement with a best-fit line through the C7–C19
mole percentages than the line for M+ = 381.0. This suggests that an adjustment of the plus molecu￾lar weight from 381.0 to 350.5 is justified and not just a convenient fitting tool.
As can be seen from the full-drawn line in Figure 7.6, an almost perfect match of the liquid 
dropout curve is seen using the molar composition based on a plus molecular weight of 350.5. 
The characterized composition (for M+ of 350.5) can be seen in Table 7.8 and binary interaction

7.3 DIFFERENTIAL LIBERATION
Section 3.1.2 describes a differential liberation experiment. Table 3.13 shows differential liberation data 
for the oil mixture in Table 3.6. The composition was characterized for the Soave–Redlich–Kwong 
and Peng–Robinson equations of state, and a constant (temperature-independent) Peneloux volume 
shift parameter was used. The characterized compositions in Table 7.5 were generated using the prop￾erty correlations in Equations 5.1 through 5.3 and the coefficients in Table 5.3. The C7+ fraction was 
represented using three pseudocomponents. Binary interaction coefficients are shown in Table 7.6.
Experimental and simulated differential liberation results are plotted in Figures 7.11 through 
7.16. Figure 7.11 shows Bo factors (defined in Equation 3.9), Figure 7.12 shows solution gas/oil ratios

7.5 SOLUBILITY SWELLING TEST
A swelling experiment is described in Section 3.2.1. Table 3.38 shows results of a swelling test for 
the oil and the injection gas in Table 3.39. The oil composition was characterized for the Soave–
Redlich–Kwong equation of state, and a constant (temperature independent) Peneloux volume shift 
parameter was used. The characterized composition in Table 7.15 was generated using the property 
correlations in Equations 5.1 through 5.3 and the SRK coefficients in Table 5.3. The C7+ fraction was 
represented using 12 pseudocomponents. Binary interaction coefficients are shown in Table 7.16. 
The fractions C7–C9 were kept as separate fractions. The C10+ fraction was split into nine pseudo￾components of approximately the same weight amount.
To give an idea of the importance of the Peneloux volume correction, C7+ pseudocomponent 
densities at 1.01 bar and 15°C for the characterized mixture in Table 7.15 are in Figure 7.17 plotted 
against molecular weight. For the lumped fractions, the “experimental” densities are determined 
from Equations 5.20 and 5.21. Also plotted in Figure 7.17 are the densities of the C7+ pseudocom￾ponents calculated using the SRK equation of state (EoS) with and without volume correction. 
For pseudocomponents with a molecular weight below ~400, the SRK equation simulates too-low 
densities (too-high molar volumes). For higher molecular weights, the SRK densities are too high 
(molar volumes too low). This explains why the volume shift parameter in Table 7.15 is positive 
for the lighter C7+ pseudocomponents and negative for the heaviest ones. The volume correction

parameter is defined in Equation 4.44 as the difference between the SRK molar volume and the real

which, as illustrated in Figure 7.17, will ensure that the SRK–Peneloux densities at standard condi￾tions agree with the experimental densities.

gas was added.214 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
7.6 GAS REVAPORIZATION
A gas revaporization experiment is described in Section 3.2.5. Table 3.51 shows the results of three 
gas revaporization experiments carried out on the reservoir fluid in Table 3.50 using three different 
injection gases, N2, CO2, and the hydrocarbon gas in Table 3.50. Kumar et al. (2015) have presented 
the EoS model in Tables 7.17 and 7.18 for use with the volume-corrected SRK equation, which gave 
a good match of the experimental gas revaporization data. In Figure 7.20, experimental and simu￾lated liquid volume percents are plotted as a function of the amount of gas added.

7.7 PVT SIMULATIONS WITH PC-SAFT EOS
Table 7.19 shows isothermal oil compressibilities reported by Tybjerg and Pedersen (2017) for the 
oil mixture in Table 5.22 at a temperature of 123°C. The data is plotted in Figure 7.21 together with 
simulation results obtained with the PC-SAFT EoS model in Table 5.23 and the SRK-Peneloux and 
PR-Peneloux equations using the characterization procedure of Pedersen et al. described in Chapter 
5. The best match of the experimental compressibility data is seen with the PC-SAFT equation of 
state. This agrees with the findings of Larsen et al. (2011), who have shown that the PC-SAFT equa￾tion provides a better match of the high-pressure oil compressibilities for a Gulf of Mexico reservoir 
fluid than the SRK–Peneloux equation.
Leekumjorn and Krejbjerg (2013) have presented PC-SAFT PVT simulation results for the fluid 
in Table 3.44 and see a good match of both routine and PVT data with gas injection reported by 
Negahban et al. (2010).
7.8 GAS Z-FACTORS
Table 7.20 shows gas Z-factors at a temperature of 41.85°C for a four-component gas measured 
using a Burnett cell as described in Section 3.1.7 (Mollerup and Angelo 1985). Also shown are 
Z-factors calculated using the GERG-2008 and the volume-corrected SRK and PR equations. As 
can be seen from the table, the measured Z-factors are simulated very accurately using the GERG￾2008 equation, which is described in Section 4.10.
7.9 MERCURY
Mercury in its elemental form is present in many reservoir fluids. The presence of mercury can lead 
to operational as well as safety and health problems. It is therefore of interest to be able to calculate 
the solubility of mercury in reservoir fluids and natural gases. Chapoy et al. (2020a, 2020b) have 
made a comprehensive review of literature data for the Hg solubility in pure hydrocarbons, inor￾ganic gases, and mixtures of those components and have also presented new experimental data.

7.10 WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A PVT SIMULATION
The preceding examples illustrate the fact that it is generally possible, from an accurate composi￾tional analysis and using a C7+ characterization method customized for a particular equation of state, 
to simulate PVT properties satisfactorily. Inaccuracies in the measured plus molecular weight may 
have to be assessed, as was done for the fluid composition in Table 3.15 when simulating the CVD 
experiment. Some deviations can be seen between measured and simulated isothermal oil compress￾ibilities. This is the case with the SRK–Peneloux simulations for the oil mixture in Table 3.6, as seen 
from Figure 7.5. Problems matching experimental liquid compressibilities is a deficiency in the cubic 
equation of state itself and not something that is easily cured by adjusting EoS parameters.
Taking into consideration that it is generally possible to predict PVT properties of oil and gas 
condensate mixtures solely based on an accurate compositional analysis, one may wonder why 
so much effort is spent on tuning of EoS parameters to match experimental PVT data. There are 
number of reasons. Compositional analyses are not always of the same quality as those presented in 
Chapter 3. Most compositional analyses are based on gas chromatography, the type of analyses that 
will usually lead to less accurate PVT simulation results than simulations based on compositional 
data originating from a true boiling point (TBP) analysis. The two mentioned analytical techniques 
are described in Chapter 2. Another reason for tuning the EoS parameters can be the need to lump

the components into very few pseudocomponents (e.g., a total of six) to keep down the computation 
time in compositional reservoir simulations. Regression can also be needed when fluids from dif￾ferent zones of a reservoir are to be represented using the same pseudocomponents, as explained in 
Section 5.6. Regression to experimental PVT data is dealt with in Chapter 9.

Thermal Properties
This chapter deals with fluid properties that cannot be calculated solely from an equation of state. 
An equation of state considers molecular interactions. Thermal properties are also affected by the 
energy carried inside the molecules, which are not considered by an equation of state. A molecule 
with more than one atom is not a rigid structure. It has so-called internal degrees of freedom that, as 
sketched in Figure 8.1, enable the atoms connected in a molecule to rotate and vibrate.
8.1 ENTHALPY
Enthalpy (H) is defined in Equation A.6 in Appendix A and used to describe the total heat content 
of a system. It has two contributions, the ideal gas contribution and the residual contribution.
H H H id res = + (8.1)
The highest enthalpy a fluid can have at a given temperature is that of an ideal gas for which the 
residual enthalpy is zero. The residual enthalpy accounts for molecular attractions and will contrib￾ute to the total enthalpy with a negative term. The higher the molecular attractions, the lower the 
residual enthalpy. A gas passing through a valve is an example of a process with no enthalpy change. 
That, however, does not mean that the ideal gas and the residual terms are unaffected by the pas￾sage of the valve. Because of the pressure drop, the distance between the molecules increases and 
the intermolecular attractions decrease. That will make the residual enthalpy increase (get closer 
to zero). To keep the enthalpy constant, the ideal gas enthalpy must decrease, resulting in a tem￾perature drop over the valve. Condensation results in a large drop in residual enthalpy. Figure 8.2
illustrates three different levels of enthalpy, that of an ideal gas for which there is limited interaction 
between the molecules and the enthalpy is determined by the energy carried inside the molecules. 
The next (lower) level is that of a gas at a higher pressure for which the attraction between the mol￾ecules starts to influence the enthalpy with a negative residual term. Finally, the third level is that 
in the liquid state in which the attraction between the molecules is high and it would require much 
energy to bring the fluid back to the ideal gas state.
In the liquid state, the residual enthalpy increases slightly with increasing pressure (becomes less 
negative). That is caused by the repulsive intermolecular forces acting in the high-pressure liquid state. 
For a liquid at high pressure, a pressure drop will result in a relaxation of the repulsive forces, which 
will make the residual enthalpy decrease. A pressure drop at a constant enthalpy (passage of a valve) 
will for a liquid make the temperature increase. To keep a constant enthalpy with a decreasing residual 
enthalpy, the ideal gas enthalpy must increase, which will result in a temperature increase. At high 
pressure (usually over 400 bar), the residual enthalpy for a gas is also seen to increase with increasing 
pressure, and an isenthalpic expansion will make the temperature increase, as is the case for a liquid.

8.3 ENTROPY
The entropy defines the amount of heat (Q) that can be converted into work (W). The terms Q and 
W are defined in Appendix A. Figure 8.3 illustrates a fluid system at two different temperatures, 
Thigh and Tlow, with corresponding thermal energies of Qhigh and Qlow, respectively. Assume that the 
total loss of thermal energy between the high temperature and low temperature state is used to gen￾erate work (W), and the process is adiabatic (no heat exchange with surroundings) and reversible; 
then it is a process of a constant entropy, which means

Entropy is a useful quantity to evaluate how much work can be produced from a given amount of

can be generated is

Had it been possible to continue the process to the absolute zero (0 K or −273.15°C), all heat could 
have been converted to work.
In the oil industry, entropy is important because there are some processes of approximately con￾stant entropy. That is the case with compression processes, although there will always be some heat 
loss to the surroundings.
The entropy can be calculated as the sum of two contributions, an ideal gas entropy and a resid￾ual entropy:

Pref is a reference pressure for which 1 atm (1.01325 bar) is a convenient choice. If Tref = 273.15 K and 
Pref = 1 atm, S in Equation 8.16 becomes the entropy relative to the entropy of the same composition 
as an ideal gas at 273.15 K and 1 atm. CPi

Figure 8.4 shows a plot of the enthalpy for the gas condensate mixture in Table 5.11 as a function of 
pressure for a series of temperatures. The enthalpy is calculated using the Peneloux-corrected SRK 
equation of state (Equation 4.43). For a constant enthalpy, the temperature is seen to increase with 
pressure at low pressures. The highest increase is seen inside the two-phase area. In this region, the 
enthalpy at a constant temperature decreases with increasing pressure as a result of the condensation 
taking place when the pressure is increased. Outside the two-phase region, the influence of pres￾sure on enthalpy is less pronounced. At pressures above ~400 bar, the temperature for a constant 
enthalpy is seen to decrease with increasing pressure. Whether the temperature in the single-phase 
region will increase or decrease with pressure depends on the Joule–Thomson coefficient defined 
in Equation 8.21. For positive Joule–Thomson coefficients, the temperature for a constant H will 
increase with pressure, whereas a temperature decrease will be seen for a fluid of a negative Joule–
Thomson coefficient. It can be seen from Figure 8.4 that the fluid composition in Table 5.11 has a 
negative Joule–Thomson coefficient for pressures higher than ~400 bar.
Figure 8.5 shows the enthalpy of pure CO2 as a function of pressure for a series of temperatures 
calculated using the Span–Wagner equation (Section 4.11).

8.7.2 Entropy
Figure 8.6 shows a plot of the entropy for the oil mixture in Table 3.6 as a function of pressure for 
a series of temperatures and Figure 8.7 a similar plot for CO2 calculated using the Span–Wagner 
equation (section 4.11).
A compression process is often approximated as one of a constant entropy. Figure 8.7 may there￾fore give an idea about the temperature that can be expected if CO2 undergoes a compression pro￾cess. It may, for example, be seen from Figure 8.7 that an outlet temperature of around 100°C can 
be expected if CO2 without any heat loss to the surroundings is compressed from 40 bar to 95 bar, 
starting at a temperature of 30°C.
8.7.3 Heat Capacity
The heat capacity (Cp) of a liquid oil mixture increases with temperature, as can be seen from 
Figure 8.8 for the oil mixture in Table 3.6, but Cp is not much affected by pressure.
8.7.4 Joule–Thomson Coefficient
Figure 8.9 shows Joule–Thomson coefficients for the gas condensate mixture in Table 5.11, cal￾culated for four different temperatures using the PR equation. The Joule–Thomson coefficient is 
positive at lower pressures, meaning that an increased pressure at a constant enthalpy will result in 
a higher temperature. The Joule–Thomson coefficient will become zero for some pressure in the 
range from 350 to 500 bar, depending on temperature. At even higher pressures, the temperature 
will decrease if the pressure is further increased at a constant enthalpy.
Table 8.1 shows experimental (Wang et al. 2017) and simulated Joule–Thomson coefficients for 
carbon dioxide (CO2) and Table 8.2 experimental Joule–Thomson coefficients (Sage et al. 1936) for 
propane (C3). Figure 8.10 shows a plot of the experimental Joule–Thomson coefficients of propane 
for three different temperatures together with values simulated using the PR equation of state.
Meisingset and Pedersen (2016) have outlined how the Joule–Thompson coefficient can be 
derived from well test analysis data when the reservoir temperature is known. One of the fluids 
considered is a lean gas condensate of the composition in Table 8.3. During a well test, there is

disregarded, the enthalpy of the fluid in the reservoir will be the same as that of the fluid at the bot￾tom hole (BH). Figure 8.12 shows the BH pressure and temperature profiles during the well test for Thermal Properties 231

Regression to 
Experimental PVT Data
It is common practice in the oil industry to try to eliminate deviations between measured and 
simulated PVT data by adjustment of model parameters. This tradition dates back to a time when 
extended compositional analyses were rare. With a composition ending at C7+ or even C6+, and no 
established procedure to split up the plus fraction, it was unlikely to see accurate predictions of PVT 
properties. Coats (1982) has presented an extensive work on how to perform pseudorization with a 
composition to C6+ or C7+ as the starting point.
In the 1980s, it became common to have TBP analyses or other extended compositional analyses 
carried out (see Chapter 2). That type of analytical information was used to develop the procedures 
presented in Chapter 5 for splitting up a plus fraction. The combination of improved analytical tech￾niques and proper C7+ characterization procedures served to improve the quality of PVT simulation 
results to often not require any parameter tuning.
Nevertheless, regression is still in common use, one reason being that heavy lumping may be 
required in compositional reservoir simulation studies, and heavy lumping will often deteriorate the 
quality of the simulation results. Regression may also be needed to get an acceptable match of PVT 
data for multiple compositions, characterized to the same pseudocomponents using the procedures 
outlined in Section 5.6.
Also, for near-critical fluids, there may be a need for regression, as the match of the PVT data is 
quite dependent on the critical point of the fluid being matched.
PVT data as presented in Chapter 3 is the typical source of a parameter regression. The data 
material may comprise saturation points, phase densities, relative gas and oil volumes, phase com￾positions, composition of critical mixture (swelling test), and minimum miscibility pressures (slim 
tube tests).
Typically, the experimental PVT data available for regression will primarily comprise data 
measured at the reservoir temperature. The parameters estimated by regression will be those 
for which the model most closely reproduces the measured PVT data, which essentially means 
the parameters that best represent the phase behavior at the reservoir temperature. This does 
not necessarily ensure that the estimated parameters will be valid at temperatures not covered 
by experimental data. For example, it may lead to erroneous results when a PVT program, after 
regression to conventional PVT data, is used to generate property tables for subsea pipeline 
conditions or is used to generate properties for a reservoir fluid undergoing gas injection for 
enhanced oil recovery purposes. These potential dangers of a parameter regression are illus￾trated in Figure 9.1.
9.1 REGRESSION PARAMETERS
It is good practice not to modify the equation of state parameters for components lighter than 
C7. The parameters left for regression are Tcs Pcs, acentric factors, and volume corrections of the 
C7+ components and the binary interaction coefficients (kij) between C7+ and lighter components. 
Pedersen et al. (1988) warn against the use of nonzero binary hydrocarbon–hydrocarbon inter￾action coefficients, as it may result in simulation of false liquid–liquid splits. The c parameters 
of the volume-corrected SRK and PR equations (Equations 4.43 and 4.48) influence the density 
9236 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
without affecting phase equilibrium results (saturation points, phase compositions, and phase 
amounts). For C7+ pseudocomponents, the c parameter may be determined as the difference 
between the real molar volume and the molar volume calculated using the SRK/PR equation 
with no volume correction. The former volume may be calculated as the ratio of the component 
molecular weight and the density at standard conditions, whose properties for the carbon num￾ber fractions are available from the measured composition or from the C7+ characterization. The 
formula used to determine the c parameter (Peneloux volume correction) is shown as Equation 
5.6. By determining the C7+ c parameters in this manner, it is implicitly assumed that the differ￾ence between the real molar volume and that calculated using the SRK/PR equation is constant, 
independent of T, P, and mixture composition. This is not necessarily a valid assumption. The 
difference may vary with temperature, which may be accounted for by making the volume cor￾rection a linear function of temperature as expressed in Equation 5.9 or by treating the c param￾eter as a regression parameter.
Experimental data shows that the critical temperatures of C7+ components increase with 
carbon number, while the critical pressures decrease with carbon number. The acentric fac￾tors increase with carbon number up to around C50. For higher carbon numbers, a slight 
decrease is seen with increasing carbon number as ring-shaped and branched molecules of 
lower acentric factors dominate over n-paraffins. The trends for Tc, Pc, and acentric factor 
are shown by fully drawn lines in Figure 9.2. The Tcs and Pcs are by far the most efficient 
regression parameters.
Christensen (1999) has outlined a regression procedure for matching of specific PVT data while 
limiting the impact on properties not covered in the regression. Instead of regressing on individual 
component properties (typically Tc, Pc, and acentric factor of pseudocomponents), the coefficients in 
the Tc, Pc, and m correlations (Equations 5.1 to 5.3) are used as regression parameters. This ensures a 
smooth development in Tc, Pc, and acentric factor with molecular weight, which would in general not 
be the case if properties of individual pseudocomponents were tuned on. Essentially, Christensen’s 
procedure consists in rotating the Tc, Pc, and acentric factor curves for the C7+ carbon number frac￾tions around the value of C7, as sketched with dashed lines in Figure 9.2.

FIGURE 9.1 Dangers of regression to experimental PVT data. Regression will in general provide an 
improved match of volumetric properties and saturation points for temperatures near the reservoir tempera￾ture (Tres). An improved match cannot be expected for any other properties. The value of the regression is also 
questionable for volumetric properties and saturation points at temperatures far from that in the reservoir.Regression to Experimental PVT Data 237

OBS stands for observed and CALC for calculated. For liquid dropout curves from a constant mass 
expansion or a constant volume depletion experiment, adding a constant to all OBS and CALC 
values is recommended. This constant is added to reduce the importance assigned to data points 
with small liquid dropouts relative to data points with larger liquid dropouts. A convenient value 
for the constant could be the maximum liquid dropout divided by three. The weight factor (wj
) and 
the user-specified weight (WOBSj
) to be assigned to the j-th observation are interrelated as follows:

A minimization algorithm based on the principle of Marquardt (1963) is suited to determine the 
parameters minimizing the object function in Equation 9.1.
The number of regression parameters must not exceed the number of data points. To ensure that 
the regressed parameters are generally applicable, it is recommended to limit the number of regres￾sion parameters (NPAR) to
NPAR = +1 ln N( ) OBS (9.4)
9.3 EXAMPLE OF REGRESSION FOR GAS CONDENSATE
Figure 7.2 reveals some deviations between a measured (Table 3.9) and two simulated liquid drop￾out curves for the gas condensate mixture in Table 3.8. One simulation was based on the fluid being 
characterized to a total of 22 components (Table 7.1) and the other on the fluid being characterized 
to a total of 6 components (Table 7.3).
A regression to the constant mass expansion (CME) data in Table 3.9 was carried out following 
the procedure in Section 9.1 with the fluid composition in Table 3.8 characterized to a total of 22 
(pseudo)components (10 defined components and 12 pseudocomponents). The coefficients c2, c3, 
and d2 in the correlations used to find Tc and Pc of the C7+ fractions (Equations 5.1 and 5.2) were 
regressed on. The coefficients c1 in Equation 5.1 and d1 in Equation 5.2 were modified to keep a 
constant Tc and Pc of a typical C7 component (defined as one with a molecular weight of 94 and 
a density at standard conditions of 0.745 g/cm3
). Using this procedure, the regression will rotate 
the curves for Tc and Pc versus molecular weight around the default values of a C7 component, as 
sketched with dashed lines in Figure 9.2. Table 9.1 shows the coefficients to be input in Equations 
5.1 and 5.2 after regression. A maximum 20% adjustment of the Tcs and Pcs was accepted relative to 
the Tcs and Pcs, found using the standard coefficients in Table 5.3. The resulting regressed fluid can 
be seen in Table 9.2. The mole percentages differ slightly from those in Table 7.1 because the C20+Regression to Experimental PVT Data 239

unaffected by the regression, although the regression has markedly improved the match of the liquid 
dropout curve, as can be seen from Figure 9.6. Finally, Figure 9.7 shows a slightly improved match Regression to Experimental PVT Data 241

data is almost perfect after the regression.
As can be seen from Figure 7.2, too small a CME liquid dropout and too low a saturation pres￾sure are simulated using a default six-component description for the fluid composition in Table 3.8
(characterized mixture in Table 7.3). It was recommended in Chapter 5 to lump the C7+ components 
into pseudocomponents of approximately equal weight amounts. Although this recommendation 
is valid for oil mixtures in general and for gas condensate mixtures when the C7+ components are 
represented using 10–12 pseudocomponents, precautions need to be taken when gas condensate 
mixtures need to be heavily lumped. A too-small simulated liquid dropout suggests that more 
importance is to be assigned to the heavy hydrocarbons contained in the gas condensate mixture. 
With the total C7+ fraction of the gas condensate mixture in Table 3.8 described using only three 
components and an equal-weight-based lumping, the heaviest pseudocomponent will contain all 
the fractions from C16 to C80, as can be seen in Table 7.3. Table 9.3 shows a different lumping 
(non-regressed) in which the heaviest pseudocomponent contains the C51–C80 fractions (binary 
interaction coefficients in Table 9.4). The dashed–dotted lines in Figures 9.8 through 9.10 show 
CME simulation results using this lumping. As a result of the changed lumping, the measured 
liquid dropout curve is better matched than with the six-component description in Figure 7.2. A 
regression was performed using the same lumping. The resulting characterized mixture can be 
seen in Table 9.3 (regressed). The pseudocomponent mole percentages differ slightly from those 
of the non-regressed mixture because the C20+ molecular weight was increased by 2.7%, from 
362 to 371.9, keeping the weight composition constant. The C7+ volume shift parameters (c0) were 
decreased by 34% relative to the shift parameter found from Equation 5.6. The relative volumes 
and the single-phase gas Z-factors are almost unaffected by the regression, as can be seen from 
Figures 9.8 and 9.10, respectively. The experimental liquid dropout curve is matched much better 
after regression (Figure 9.9).Regression to Experimental PVT Data 243

The heaviest pseudocomponent in the regressed composition in Table 9.3 covers the C51–

One may wonder whether a fraction that small will influence the PVT behavior at all. Figure 
9.11 shows a simulated liquid dropout curve where the C51–C80 fractions have been neglected 
(dashed–dotted line). The same plot shows the simulated liquid dropout curve where C51–C80
is considered (dashed line). It can be seen that the C50+ fraction makes the simulated satura￾tion pressure increase by ̴50 bar and slightly increases the whole level of liquid dropout. This 
shows that it is indeed important that the characterization acknowledge the content of C50+
components.244 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

9.4 TUNING ON SINGLE PSEUDOCOMPONENT PROPERTIES
A possible alternative to the regression procedure outlined in Section 9.1 and exemplified in Section 
9.3 would be to tune on properties (Tc, Pc, or acentric factor) of one or more pseudocomponents 
starting with the properties from the default characterization. Table 7.5 shows a characterized oil 
mixture (plus fluid in Table 3.6). The heaviest pseudocomponent consists of C27–C80 hydrocarbons 
and is assigned a Tc of 679.6°C when the fluid is characterized default for the SRK–Peneloux equa￾tion of state. The phase envelope simulated with the SRK equation of state is shown as a full-drawn 
line in Figure 9.12. Also shown in Figure 9.12 is the phase envelope simulated having increased Tc
of the C27–C80 fraction from 679.6°C to 850°C (dashed line). In addition to an increased two-phase 
area, this change is seen to introduce a three-phase area with one gas and two liquid phases. Table 
9.5 shows the results of flash calculations carried out on the oil mixture for a temperature of 100°C 
and a pressure of 212 bar. Consistent with the phase envelopes in Figure 9.12, a single liquid phase is 
found when using the default characterization. After having increased the Tc of the C27–C80 fraction 
from 679.6°C to 850°C, the mixture is seen to split into three phases, one gas and two liquid phases.
This example illustrates that adjustment of properties of single pseudocomponents should be 
used with caution. False phase splits are often seen if Tc and Pc of the C7+ pseudocomponents do not 
develop smoothly and monotonically with molecular weight.

Note: With the default characterization (Table 7.5), a single liquid phase is found for a temperature of 100°C and a pres￾sure of 212 bar. If Tc of the C27–C80 fraction is increased from 679.6°C to 850°C, the mixture will at the same condi￾tions split into three phases: one gas and two liquid phases. Nonzero binary interaction parameters can be seen in 
Table 7.6.
9.5 NEAR-CRITICAL FLUIDS
Table 9.6 shows the molar composition of a reservoir fluid with an experimentally determined criti￾cal point of 157°C and 387.5 bar (Pedersen et al. 1989). Table 9.7 shows the fluid characterized for 
the SRK–Peneloux equation of state with the C7+ fraction represented using 12 and 6 pseudocompo￾nents, respectively. Binary interaction coefficients are shown in Table 9.8. Figure 9.13 shows phase 
envelopes simulated for the two characterized fluids in Table 9.7 using the SRK–Peneloux equation. 
With 12 C7+ pseudocomponents, the critical point is simulated to be 153.6°C and 411.9 bar. With six 
C7+ pseudocomponents, the simulated critical point is 183.9.6°C and 411.4 bar. Though the critical 
pressure is almost unaffected by the lumping, the critical temperature is seen to increase with the 
degree of lumping. This is a general observation, and it may complicate regression to PVT data—
especially regression to experimental liquid dropout curves for heavily lumped fluid compositions. 
CME experiments have been carried out for the fluid in Table 9.6 at four different temperatures—
two below and two above the observed critical temperature. The experimental liquid dropout curves 
can be seen in Table 9.9. When the temperature is lower than the critical temperature, the liquid 
dropout curve starts with 100% liquid (saturation point is a bubble point), and when the temperature 
is above the critical temperature, it starts with 0% liquid (saturation point is a dew point). A plot of 
the four liquid dropout curves can be seen from Figure 9.14. The two dropout curves for tempera￾tures below the mixture critical temperature start with 100% liquid dropout, while the two for a 
temperature above the critical one start with 0% liquid dropout.
Simulated CME liquid dropout curves can be seen from Figures 9.15 through 9.18. For the two 
lower temperatures (142.2°C and 151.1°C), the simulated dropout curves using 12 and 6 C7+ pseudo￾components both qualitatively agree with the measured liquid dropout. For the two higher tempera￾tures (163.3°C and 171.0°C), the liquid dropout curves simulated using the six C7+ pseudocomponent 
description start with 100% liquid, whereas the experimental data starts with 0% liquid. The reason 
for this discrepancy is to be sought in the location of the simulated critical point (Figure 9.13), which 
when the fluid is described using six C7+ pseudocomponents is found to be 183.9.6°C. The saturation 
points for temperatures of 163.3°C and 171.0°C are according to this fluid description on the bubble 
point branch of the phase envelope where 100% liquid is in equilibrium with an incipient amount 
of gas.248 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

A regression was performed using a six–C7+ pseudocomponent description to match the experi￾mental critical point of 157°C and 387.5 bar and the four saturation pressures in Table 9.9. The coef￾ficients c2, c3, and d2 in the correlations used for Tc and Pc of the C7+ fractions (Equations 5.1 and 
5.2) were regressed on. The coefficient c1 in Equation 5.1 and the coefficient d1 in Equation 5.2 were 
modified to keep Tc and Pc of a typical C7 component constant (see Section 9.1). The C20+ molecular 
weight was increased by 5% keeping the weight composition constant. The regressed composition 
can be seen in Table 9.10. The simulated critical point after regression was 157°C and 392 bar, 
meaning that the mixture critical temperature as a result of the regression has been lowered by more 
than 20°C. That makes the four simulated CME liquid dropout curves start with the right volume 
percentage of liquid (100% or 0%, depending on temperature), as can be seen from Figure 9.19. It 
had been difficult to get an equally good match without having the option to regress directly on the 
mixture critical point.Regression to Experimental PVT Data 249 TABLE 9.7 Reservoir Fluid in Table 9.6 Characterized for the SRK–Peneloux Equation of State Using 12 and 6 C7+ Pseudocomponents, Respectively C7+ Fraction Represented Using 12 Pseudocomponents C7+ Fraction Represented Using 6 Pseudocomponents Mol% Molecular Weight Tc (°C) Pc (bar) Acentric Factor c0 (cm3/ mol) Mol% Molecular Weight Tc (°C) Pc (bar) Acentric Factor c0 (cm3/ mol) N2 0.46 28.0 −147.0 33.94 0.040 0.92 N2 0.46 28.0 −147.0 33.94 0.040 0.92 CO2 3.36 44.0 31.1 73.76 0.225 3.29 CO2 3.36 44.0 31.1 73.76 0.225 3.29 C1 62.36 16.0 −82.6 46.00 0.008 0.63 C1 62.36 16.0 −82.6 46.00 0.008 0.63 C2 8.90 30.1 32.3 48.84 0.098 2.63 C2 8.90 30.1 32.3 48.84 0.098 2.63 C3 5.31 44.1 96.7 42.46 0.152 5.06 C3 5.31 44.1 96.7 42.46 0.152 5.06 iC4 0.92 58.1 135.0 36.48 0.176 7.29 iC4 0.92 58.1 135.0 36.48 0.176 7.29 nC4 2.08 58.1 152.1 38.00 0.193 7.86 nC4 2.08 58.1 152.1 38.00 0.193 7.86 iC5 0.73 72.2 187.3 33.84 0.227 10.93 iC5 0.73 72.2 187.3 33.84 0.227 10.93 nC5 0.85 72.2 196.5 33.74 0.251 12.18 nC5 0.85 72.2 196.5 33.74 0.251 12.18 C6 1.05 86.2 234.3 29.69 0.296 17.98 C6 1.05 86.2 234.3 29.69 0.296 17.98 C7 1.85 95.0 259.7 31.95 0.465 9.63 C7 1.85 95.0 259.7 31.95 0.465 9.63 C8 1.75 106.0 279.9 29.44 0.497 14.65 C8 1.75 106.0 279.9 29.44 0.497 14.65 C9 1.40 121.0 302.6 26.08 0.540 22.84 C9 1.40 121.0 302.6 26.08 0.540 22.84 C10–C11 1.91 141.6 331.0 23.03 0.599 31.63 C10–C15 4.64 165.1 361.8 20.82 0.669 38.44 C12–C13 1.51 170.5 365.6 20.28 0.676 40.07 C16–C25 2.91 265.1 458.9 15.80 0.919 46.44 C14–C15 1.22 195.2 392.7 18.89 0.741 42.42 C26–C80 1.43 488.8 634.9 13.06 1.246 −17.76 C16–C18 1.34 230.3 425.3 16.86 0.829 47.78 — — — — — — — C19–C21 0.85 271.0 460.9 15.64 0.924 44.72 — — — — — — — C22–C25 0.72 323.1 501.8 14.53 1.034 35.68 — — — — — — — C26–C30 0.57 384.9 547.3 13.73 1.147 17.21 — — — — — — — C31–C39 0.52 476.7 610.2 13.05 1.274 −19.73 — — — — — — — C40–C80 0.35 678.6 743.1 12.45 1.310 −119.67 — — — — — — — Note: No regression has been performed.

9.6 FLUIDS CHARACTERIZED TO THE SAME PSEUDOCOMPONENTS
Section 5.6 dealt with multiple fluids characterized to the same pseudocomponents. This is a useful 
way to keep the total number of components low when dealing with multiple streams in a flow line 
network or when carrying out reservoir simulation studies for a field made up of reservoir zones 
of different compositions. A typical example could be a reservoir with an upper gas cap and an oil 
zone beneath separated by a gas–oil contact, as further discussed in Chapter 14. Table 3.6 shows a 
reservoir oil composition, and Table 3.15 shows a gas condensate composition. An oil zone beneath 
a gas cap is also called an oil leg. Table 9.11 shows a common characterization (non-regressed 
parameters) for the two fluid compositions, using the principles of Section 5.6 for characterizing 
multiple compositions to the same pseudocomponents. Differential liberation simulation results for 
the oil mixture can be seen as dashed lines in Figures 9.20 through 9.25. Experimental differential 
liberation results from Table 3.13 are shown in the same plots. The simulated results can be com￾pared with those in Figures 7.11 through 7.16, which were based on a fluid characterization for the 
oil mixture alone. The simulation results in Figures 9.20 through 9.25 are almost unaffected by the 
fact that the oil is represented using the same C7+ pseudocomponents as a gas condensate mixture.
Constant volume depletion simulation results for the gas condensate mixture in Table 3.15 char￾acterized to the same pseudocomponents as the oil mixture in Table 3.6 can be seen from Figures 
9.26 through 9.29, which also show experimental constant volume depletion results from Table 3.16. 
The simulation results can be compared with those in Figures 7.6 and 7.8 through 7.10, which were 
achieved based on a fluid characterization for the gas condensate mixture alone. There is a need to 
improve the match of the liquid dropout curve in Figure 9.26. This will often be the case for gas con￾densate mixtures when characterized to the same pseudocomponents as one or more oil mixtures.
The coefficients c2, c3, d2, d3, and e2 in the correlations used for Tc, Pc, and m of the C7+ fractions 
(Equations 5.1 through 5.3) were regressed on. The coefficients c1 in Equation 5.1, d1 in Equation 5.2, 
and e1 in Equation 5.3 were modified to keep Tc, Pc, and the acentric factor of a typical C7 compo￾nent constant (see Section 9.1). An adjustment of maximum 10% of the plus molecular weights was 
allowed for both oil and gas condensate mixtures while keeping the weight compositions constant. 
The resulting fluid characterization common for both fluids can be seen in Table 9.11 (regressed 
parameters) with binary interaction parameters in Table 9.12. The assumed C10+ molecular weight of 
the oil mixture in Table 3.6 was reduced from 453.0 to 407.7, and the assumed C20+ molecular weight 
of the gas condensate mixture in Table 3.15 was reduced from 381.0 to 342.9. For both compositions, 
the weight % composition was kept constant. The resulting differential liberation simulation results 
for the oil mixture can be seen as dashed–dotted lines in Figures 9.20 through 9.25 and the constant 
volume depletion results for the gas condensate mixture as dashed–dotted lines in Figures 9.26 
through 9.29. The experimental data is matched almost perfectly, which is noteworthy considering 
that both fluid compositions are represented using the same three C7+ pseudocomponents.
9.7 PVT DATA WITH GAS INJECTION
The minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) is a key property when gas injection for EOR purposes 
is considered for a field. The term minimum miscibility pressure was introduced in Section 3.2.4 
and is further dealt with in Chapter 15.
Table 9.13 shows a reservoir oil composition for which swelling data is given in Table 9.14. The 
MMP with CO2 as injection gas has been determined to 179 bar at the reservoir temperature of 
121°C. Table 9.15 shows the reservoir fluid composition lumped to eight pseudocomponents. The 
fluid was characterized for the SRK–Peneloux equation using the procedure of Pedersen et al. in 
Chapter 5. CO2 was kept separate because the injection gas consists of pure CO2. Nonzero binary 
interaction parameters are given in Table 9.16. With this fluid description, the CO2 MMP at 121°C 
is simulated to 151 bar, which is 28 bar lower than the measured MMP. An EOR PVT study may 
comprise an extensive amount of data, and the question is what other data to match to improve the 
match of the MMP while retaining a good description of all other data.256 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids TABLE 9.11 The Oil Mixture in Table 3.6 and the Gas Condensate Mixture in Table 3.15 Characterized to the Same Pseudocomponents Non-Regressed Parameters Regressed Parameters Oil (Table 3.6) Gas Condensate (Table 3.15) Tc (°C) Pc (bar) Acentric Factor c0 (cm3/ mol) Oil (Table 3.6) Gas Condensate (Table 3.15) Tc (°C) Pc (bar) Acentric Factor c0 (cm3/ mol) N2 0.39 0.64 −147.0 33.94 0.040 0.92 N2 0.39 0.64 −147.0 33.94 0.040 0.92 CO2 0.30 3.53 31.1 73.76 0.225 3.03 CO2 0.30 3.53 31.1 73.76 0.225 3.29 C1 40.20 70.79 −82.6 46.00 0.008 0.63 C1 39.91 70.73 −82.6 46.00 0.008 0.63 C2 7.61 8.94 32.3 48.84 0.098 2.63 C2 7.55 8.93 32.3 48.84 0.098 2.63 C3 7.95 5.05 96.7 42.46 0.152 5.06 C3 7.89 5.05 96.7 42.46 0.152 5.06 iC4 1.19 0.85 135.0 36.48 0.176 7.29 iC4 1.18 0.85 135.0 36.48 0.176 7.29 nC4 4.08 1.68 152.1 38.00 0.193 7.86 nC4 4.05 1.68 152.1 38.00 0.193 7.86 iC5 1.39 0.62 187.3 33.84 0.227 10.93 iC5 1.38 0.62 187.3 33.84 0.227 10.93 nC5 2.15 0.79 196.5 33.74 0.251 12.18 nC5 2.13 0.79 196.5 33.74 0.251 12.18 C6 2.79 0.83 234.3 29.69 0.296 17.98 C6 2.77 0.83 234.3 29.69 0.296 18.10 C7–C12 17.74 4.23 302.7 26.41 0.545 22.15 C7–C12 17.61 4.23 298.5 27.72 0.545 12.80 C13–C23 9.25 1.66 426.4 17.04 0.834 48.39 C13–C22 9.41 1.74 400.3 19.81 0.835 −5.60 C24–C80 4.96 0.38 651.5 13.38 1.229 −24.40 C23–C80 5.43 0.39 540.1 16.96 1.202 −115.89 Note: The parameter c0 is the Peneloux volume shift parameter as defined in Equation 4.44.

At the point in the reservoir where miscibility develops, the fluid is at a critical point. The com￾position of the critical fluid at that location is unknown, as miscibility has developed as a result of 
multiple contacts between gas and oil. The critical composition in the miscibility zone can therefore 
not be regressed to. Instead regression may be carried out to the critical point on the swelling curve. 
The swelling experiment in Table 9.14 shows that the saturation point changes from a bubble point 
to a dew point between 175 and 225 mol% CO2 added. An estimate of the critical composition 
could therefore be reservoir oil and CO2 mixed in a molar ratio of 100:200. With the non-regressed 
fluid description in Table 9.15, the shift from bubble to dew point is simulated to happen between 
50 and 100 mol% CO2 added. A regression to the swelling data in Table 9.14 was carried out. One

of the data points tuned to was that 200 mol% CO2 added should give a critical composition. The 
coefficients c1–c3 in Equation 5.1 and the coefficients d1–d2 in Equation 5.2 were used as tuning 
parameters. The regressed parameters can be seen in Table 9.15 (binary interaction parameters in 
Table 9.16). The MMP at 121°C calculated using the regressed fluid composition is 175 bar, which is 
only 4 bar lower than the measured MMP. This example shows that much tedious regression work 
can be avoided by first evaluating the data material and regressing to the key data. In the actual case, 
the target was to match the MMP, and the key to matching the MMP was matching the critical point 
on the swelling curve.
9.8 REGRESSION TARGETING ESTIMATED CRITICAL POINT
Takeshi et al. (2020) have presented a common EoS model for 21 reservoir fluids, 11 of which were 
oils with swelling data reported. All the swelling experiments for the oils were continued until 
the bubble point shifted to a dew point. Among the 21 fluids were also 3 near-critical gas conden￾sates with CME and CVD liquid dropout data. The mentioned PVT experiments are described in 
Chapter 3.
The common EoS model was developed by initially determining the critical point for each of the 
oils with swelling data and for each of the near-critical gas condensates. For the oils, the assumption 
was that an EoS model that correctly simulated the critical point on the swelling curve would also 
simulate the correct critical point of the reservoir fluid before addition of gas. The critical point on 
the swelling curve was determined by analyzing the CME data for each swelling stage. Figure 9.30
shows schematically CME liquid dropout curves for a reservoir fluid at four different temperatures. 
When the temperature is much lower than the critical temperature, the liquid dropout curve will 
start with 100 % liquid at the saturation point, and the liquid shrinkage will be low when the pres￾sure is lowered. Closer to the critical temperature, the liquid shrinkage increases, and right at the 
critical point, the liquid volume% would decrease from 100% to around 50% by marginally lower￾ing the pressure from that at the saturation point. At temperatures higher than the critical tempera￾ture, the liquid dropout will start with zero liquid volume at the saturation point. Close to the critical 
temperature, the liquid build-up will be high (the liquid dropout curve will be steep). Further away 
from the critical temperature, the liquid build-up will be lower, and the liquid dropout curve will 
appear flatter. The CME liquid dropout curves for the fluid mixtures at the various swelling stages 
will show a similar behavior. As long as the fluid after addition of gas still exhibits a bubble point at 
the reservoir temperature and the composition is far from critical, the liquid dropout curve will start 
at 100% liquid and the liquid shrinkage will be low. If, after adding more gas, the fluid still exhibits

a bubble point, the liquid shrinkage will be higher. Just after passing the critical composition, the 
liquid will exhibit a dew point, and the liquid build-up will be high when the pressure is reduced 
from that at the dew point. Had more gas been added (which is usually not the case), the liquid drop￾out would be lower, and the liquid dropout curve would have been less steep.
Another method was used to determine the critical point of the near-critical gas condensates. 
Figure 9.31 shows an experimental liquid dropout curve for a gas condensate fluid. Simulated liquid 
drop-out results are shown with three different fluid characterizations (EoS_1, EoS_2, and EoS_3). 
The experimental saturation pressure is matched well with all three EoS models, but the liquid 
dropouts differ. With EoS_1, too little liquid precipitates at pressures below the saturation pressure. 
EoS_2 provides an almost perfect match of the experimental liquid dropout data, while EoS_3 
simulates the saturation point to be a bubble point, while it should have been a dew point.
Phase envelopes simulated using each of the three EoS models are shown in Figure 9.32. The 
saturation pressure at the reservoir temperature of 150°C is almost the same independent of the 
model, but the location of the critical point differs. With EoS_1, the critical temperature is simu￾lated to be ̴50°C; with EoS_2, it is ̴100°C; and with EoS_3, it is ̴150°C. If the simulated critical 
temperature is too low, the liquid dropout curve at the reservoir temperature will be too flat, as is 
illustrated for EoS_1 in Figure 9.31. If the critical temperature is too high, the EoS model may simu￾late the saturation point at the reservoir temperature as a bubble point instead of a dew point, as is 
illustrated for EoS_3 in Figure 9.31. Only with the right critical point will the liquid dropout curve 
at the reservoir temperature be matched, as is the case for EoS_2. Based on these considerations, it 
is possible to conclude that the gas condensate fluid considered in Figures 9.31 and 9.32 has a critical 
temperature of around 100°C.
Pedersen et  al. (2023a, 2023b) have elaborated on the ideas brought forward in the paper of 
Takeshi et al. and found that knowledge of the critical point in addition to the saturation point at 
the reservoir temperature is sufficient to develop a reliable EoS model for a reservoir fluid. This is a 
natural extension of the ideas behind a cubic equation for a pure hydrocarbon (Chapter 4), for which 
parameters a and b and thereby the fluid phase behavior at all conditions is (essentially) determined 
by the critical temperature and pressure. For the van der Waals equation, no other parameters enter. 
In the SRK and PR equations, small changes have been introduced through the acentric factor. The 
procedure of Pedersen et al. is summarized in the following for SRK:

carbon number around the value of C7, as explained in Section 9.1 and illustrated in 
Figure 9.2.
12. Use the developed EoS model for the reservoir fluid. Since reservoir fluids most often 
contain inorganic components (N2, CO2, and H2S) in addition to hydrocarbons, the res￾ervoir fluid will have a different critical point than the hydrocarbon fluid whose critical 
point was estimated. Since the inorganic components have well-defined critical properties 
(Tc, Pc, and acentric factor), it is assumed that the developed EoS model will also predict 
the correct critical point of the reservoir fluid.
The coefficients in Equations 9.5–9.8 are for use with the SRK equation. Pedersen et al. (2023b) 
have given coefficients for use with the PR equation of state.

A differential liberation experiment has been conducted for the oil in Table 9.17, and the differ￾ential liberation data is shown in Table 9.19. The oil has a molar C7+/(C1–C6) ratio of 1.158. Using 
the procedure outlined in the preceding section, EoS model parameters are determined that will 
provide a fluid description matching the saturation point of the reservoir fluid as well as the critical

Transport Properties
The term transport properties is used about properties that influence and restrict transport of mate￾rial or heat. The effect of an external force or heat source will not immediately spread throughout 
the substance upon which it is applied. The rate at which it spreads is determined by transport prop￾erties as described in this chapter.
10.1 VISCOSITY
An external stress applied to a portion of a fluid, as illustrated in Figure 10.1, will introduce move￾ment of the molecules of the affected part of the fluid in the direction of the applied stress. The mov￾ing molecules will interact with the neighboring molecules, which will start moving, too, but with a 
lower velocity than that of the molecules exposed to the stress. The dynamic viscosity, η, is defined as
n
t = d
d
xy
x v
y
(10.1)
where
τxy = applied shear stress (force per area unit = F/A)
vx = velocity of fluid in x-direction
∂
∂
v
y
x = shear rate
If the viscosity is independent of shear rate, the fluid is said to be Newtonian in behavior.

and dilatant fluids exhibit a nonlinear relationship between shear rate and shear stress. The viscos￾ity of a pseudoplastic fluid decreases with increasing shear rate, whereas the opposite is the case for 
a dilatant fluid. A Bingham plastic fluid is similar to a Newtonian fluid in the sense that there is a 
linear relationship between shear stress and shear rate. However, a Bingham plastic fluid differs by 
requiring a finite shear stress (pressure) to initiate a flow.
Viscosity is a key property for subsurface simulations, well design, and pipeline and process sim￾ulations. Several correlations for the viscosity of petroleum systems exist, ranging from simple ones 
that require information on bulk properties such as API gravity and temperature to more complex 
ones that rely on the composition of the mixture in question. An example of the simple type of cor￾relations is the Beggs and Robinson correlation (Beggs and Robinson 1975). This chapter will focus 
on models that are applicable to both gas and liquid phases, and further provide continuous simula￾tion results with T and P in the supercritical region, where it can be difficult to distinguish between 
gas and liquid. The models should, in other words, not require any information about phase type.
The SI unit for viscosity is N sec/m2. It is related to other commonly used viscosity units as 
follows:
1 N sec/m2 = 1 kg/(m sec) = 1 Pa sec = 1000 mPa sec = 1000 centipoise (cP) = 10 poise (P)

The kinematic viscosity is the ratio of the dynamic viscosity to the density. With the viscosity in 
P and the density in g/cm3, the unit of the kinematic viscosity is Stokes or cm2/sec.
10.1.1 Corresponding States Viscosity Models
The corresponding states principle (CSP) has found application for a number of purposes, a well￾known example being the classical Z-factor correlation chart by Standing and Katz (1942). The 
basic idea is that a given property for any component can be related to that of a well-known refer￾ence compound in a corresponding state.
According to the corresponding states principle, the reduced viscosity (ηr
 = η/ηc) can, for exam￾ple, for a group of substances, be related to the reduced pressure (Pr
 = P/Pc) and temperature (Tr
 = 
T/Tc) through a unique function, f:
nr r r = f(P ,T ) (10.2)
Viscosity data at near-critical conditions is rare. Based on considerations for dilute gases 
(Hirschfelder et al. 1954), the critical viscosity, ηc, can be approximated as
nc
c
2/3 1/2
c

P M
T = (10.3)
M stands for molecular weight. This gives the following expression for reduced viscosity:
n n r
c

c

P M = (10.4)
If the function f in Equation 10.2 is known for one component (a reference component) within 
the group, it will be possible to calculate the viscosity at any (P,T) for any other component within the 
group. The viscosity of component x at (P,T) can, for example, be expressed as follows:
n n x

Quite extensive viscosity data has been published for methane, which has enabled Hanley et al. 
(1975) to make the following correlation for the methane viscosity as a function of density and 
temperature:

Equations 10.6 and 10.11 allow the methane viscosity to be calculated at any P and T. This makes 
methane a convenient choice as reference component in Equation 10.5.
The simple corresponding states principle, as expressed in Equation 10.5, works well for mix￾tures of light hydrocarbon components such as C1, C2, and C3. If the mixture contains heavy hydro￾carbons, a correction is required. Pedersen et al. (1984) have expressed the deviations from the 
classical corresponding states principle in terms of a parameter, α, and use the following expression

6. Mixture viscosity calculated from Equation 10.12.
Figure 10.3 shows plots of methane pressures as a function of density for temperatures ranging 
from 20 to 140 K calculated by use of Equation 10.11. The lower the temperature, the steeper the P 
versus density curve and more inaccurate the density and methane viscosity.
Figure 10.4 shows plots of methane viscosities as a function of temperature for pressures rang￾ing from 100 to 2000 bar. The results shown as dotted lines are calculated using Equation 10.6 and 
model parameters of Hanley et al. (1975). In the dense liquid region, the left-hand side of Equation 
10.6 is mainly governed by the term Δη′(ρ,T).

Hanley’s model presents some problems when methane is in a solid form at its reference state. 
This is the case when the methane reference temperature is below approximately 91 K, correspond￾ing to a reduced temperature of 0.48. The melting temperatures of branched paraffins, naphthenes, 
and aromatics are at a lower reduced temperature than is the case with methane. Pedersen and 
Fredenslund (1987) suggested overcoming this problem by replacing Δη′(ρ,T) by the following term 
when the methane reference temperature (To) is below 91 K:

The constants k1–k7 can be seen in Table 10.1.
Continuity between viscosities above and below the freezing point of methane is secured by 
introducing Δη″ as a fourth term in the viscosity expression as shown in the following:

Methane viscosities calculated using the modification of Pedersen and Fredenslund are shown as 
full-drawn lines in Figure 10.4. For methane reference temperatures lower than 91 K where methane 
is in solid form, the modified viscosity expression will provide somewhat higher methane viscosities 
than using the original expressions of Hanley et al. These are in better accordance with viscosity

10.1.2 Adaptation of Corresponding States Viscosity Model to Heavy Oils
Even though the performance of the corresponding states model in the classical form, with methane 
as reference component, can be stretched somewhat into the region where methane is in solid form, 
as suggested by Pedersen and Fredenslund (1987), the classical corresponding model is generally 
not suited for heavy oil mixtures with viscosities above ~10 cP. As can be seen from Figure 10.3, the 
curves for the methane density versus pressure are almost vertical for T < 60 K and are therefore 
unsuited for determining the variation in density from P and T.
Based on viscosity data for eight different heavy oil reservoir fluids, Lindeloff et al. (2004) devel￾oped a new heavy oil viscosity model that extends the applicability area of the corresponding states 
viscosity model. The C7+ density at atmospheric pressure and 15°C is above 0.9 g/cm3 for all eight 
fluids and above 1 g/cm3 for three of the fluids. This is an indication of a high content of aromatic 
compounds. For three of the fluids, the average molecular weight of the C7+ fraction exceeds 500. 
Being in general rather heavy and aromatic (biodegraded), no wax precipitation takes place, and the 
oils behave as strictly Newtonian fluids at the temperatures for which viscosity data exist.
Instead of using methane as a reference component and Equation 10.12 to determine the corre￾sponding viscosities, the viscosity of the stabilized crude is used as starting point. Based on viscos￾ity measurements on a wide range of North Sea oils and condensates, Rønningsen (1993) proposed 
a semi-empirical correlation for stabilized crude viscosities, ηo, at atmospheric pressure in cP:
log 0.07995 0.1101M 371.8
T
6.215M
T 10n - 0 = + - - (10.33)
M is the average molecular weight and T the temperature in K. For T > 564.49 K, the sign in front 
of 0.01101 is changed from − to +. To extend the correlation to be applicable for live oils, Lindeloff 
et al. proposed the following procedure for evaluating a representative average molecular weight, M:

The simulation scheme outlined in the Section 10.1.1 was modified as follows:
1. From 1 to 5: As in Section 10.1.1, except that Equation 10.29 is used for the methane vis￾cosity instead of Equation 10.6.
2. 6: Mixture viscosity calculated from Equation 10.12, with Equation 10.29 as methane vis￾cosity model for T0 > 75 K. For T0 < 65 K, Equations 10.33 and 10.36 are used. For 65 K 
< T0 < 75 K, the viscosity is calculated as a weighted average between the viscosity results 
obtained with Equation 10.12 (with Equation 10.29 as methane viscosity model) and with 
Equations 10.33 and 10.37.
By implementing the heavy oil viscosity correlation in this manner, the classical corresponding 
states model is still used for higher temperatures and lighter oil mixtures. Averaging the corre￾sponding states and the heavy oil correlation viscosities for methane reference temperatures in the 
range 65 to 75 K ensures a smooth transition to the heavy oil viscosity correlation.

Because the LBC correlation executes fast in computer code, it is often the preferred choice in 
compositional reservoir and flow simulation studies. As a predictive model, LBC will usually pro￾vide results of low quality. To match experimental data, either Vc of the pseudocomponents or one 
or more of the coefficients a1–a5 will have to be treated as tuning parameters.
Various attempts (e.g., Dandekar et  al. 1993) have been made to modify the Lohrenz–Bray–
Clark correlation to reduce the need for tuning to measured data. The fundamental assumption of 
a unique relation between reduced density and viscosity has been retained. Especially for heavy oil 
mixtures, this is a questionable assumption.
10.1.4 Other Viscosity Models
The gas viscosities reported in a standard PVT report will usually not be measured but calculated 
values. Many laboratories use the correlation of Lee et al. (1966). It expresses the gas viscosity in 
cP as follows

T is temperature in R, ρ is gas density in lb/ft3, and M is molecular weight.
It has been proposed to use the functional form of an equation of state to express the viscosity. 
A model of Guo et al. (1997) and a model of Quinones-Cisneros et al. (2003) can be mentioned as 
examples. The latter one is based on the so-called friction theory and expresses the viscosity as the 
sum of a dilute gas viscosity term, η0, and a residual friction term, ηf
n n = +0 f n (10.50)
The residual friction term is expressed as
n k f r r a k k a rr r

where Pa and Pr

The repulsive and attractive pressure terms may also be calculated from other equations of state, for 
example, the Soave–Redlich–Kwong (Equation 4.20) or the Peng–Robinson equation (Equation 4.36).
The coefficients κr

the existence of viscosity data for the mixture in question.288 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
For fluids containing solid wax particles, a non-Newtonian viscosity model may be applied, as is 
described in the section on viscosity of oil–wax suspensions in Section 11.4.
10.1.5 Viscosity Data and Simulation Results
Tables 10.4 through 10.6 show molar reservoir fluid compositions for which viscosity data is given 
in Table 10.7. The mixture in Table 10.4 is a high-temperature/high-pressure (HT/HP) reservoir fluid. 
Viscosity simulation results are shown in Figures 10.5 through 10.7 for each of the three mixtures 
using the corresponding states (CSP) and the LBC viscosity models. As can be seen from Figure 10.7, 
the LBC model has problems matching the viscosities of the oil in Table 10.6. The corresponding
states model, on the other hand, is very accurate for viscosities of this order of magnitude.  
Table 10.8 shows the compositions of three heavy oil mixtures as presented by Lindeloff et al. 
(2004). Viscosity data for these oil mixtures is shown in Table 10.9 (numbering follows that used 
by Lindeloff et al.). For Oil 5, viscosity data is given for three different temperatures ranging from 
38°C to 60°C. A temperature increase of only 22°C makes the viscosity decrease by almost a fac￾tor of six. Plots of the viscosity data in Table 10.9 can be seen from Figures 10.8 through 10.12. 
Also shown in these figures are simulated viscosity results using the corresponding states model, 
adapted for heavy oil mixtures as proposed by Lindeloff et al. The dashed lines in Figures 10.10 
through 10.12 show tuned viscosity simulation results where the multipliers 3rd CSP and 4th CSP 
in Equations 10.34 and 10.35, which are 1.0 by default, have been treated as tuning parameters. 
Viscosity data for three temperatures were tuned to at the same time. For viscosities of the order of 
1000 cP, viscosity predictions using the extended corresponding states model may deviate as much 
as a factor 2–3 from the experimental data, but in most cases a good match can be achieved by tun￾ing on the multipliers 3rd CSP and 4th CSP in Equations 10.34 and 10.35, as is exemplified by the 
dashed lines in Figures 10.10 through 10.12.
Gas viscosities are seldom measured because the commonly used viscosity correlations will, 
in general, provide results within experimental uncertainty. Kashefi et al. (2013) have, however,

full-drawn lines show the simulation results achieved with the corresponding states viscosity model.
The viscosity of the liquid phase condensing from a gas condensate fluid is important especially 
in flow line simulations, but it is rare to see viscosities reported for such liquids. One of the few 
data sources is Al-Meshari et al. (2007). Table 10.12 shows the molar compositions of a gas con￾densate mixture and a near critical reservoir fluid. Liquid viscosity data for the two fluids is shown 
in Table 10.13.
Table 10.14 shows the composition of a Gulf of Mexico (GoM) reservoir fluid for which vis￾cosity data has been measured at high pressures (Hustad et al. 2014). Viscosity data is shown 
in Table 10.15 for the reservoir fluid with various concentrations of nitrogen. Also shown in 
Table 10.15 are viscosity simulation results obtained with the corresponding states viscosity 
model.Transport Properties 297

where q is the heat flow per unit area, and (dT/dx) is the temperature gradient in the direction of the 
heat flow. The terms entering into the definition are illustrated in Figure 10.14.
Thermal conductivity is an important property, especially in flow studies, because it influences 
heat transfer and thereby the temperature profile in the pipeline. A correct representation of the 
temperature profile is needed, for example, to address the potential risk of solids precipitation (wax, 
hydrates, and scale). The thermal conductivity may be calculated using a corresponding states prin￾ciple (Christensen and Fredenslund 1980; Pedersen and Fredenslund 1987).
According to the corresponding states theory, thermal conductivity can be found from the 
expression
-r r r = f(P ,T ) (10.59)
where f is the same function for a group of substances obeying the corresponding states principle. 
For the reduced thermal conductivity, λr

where Po = PPco/Pcx, To = TTco/Tcx, and λo is the thermal conductivity of the reference substance at 
temperature To and pressure Po. As is the case for viscosity, methane is a convenient choice as reference 
substance. However, some corrections must be introduced as compared with the simple corresponding 
states principle. The thermal conductivity of polyatomic substances (Hanley 1976) can be separated 
into two contributions, one for transport of translational energy and one for transport of internal energy.

Christensen and Fredenslund (1980) have suggested that the corresponding states theory should 
only be applied to the translational term. A term λint,mix is used to correct the deviations from the 
simple corresponding states model. The final expression for the calculation of thermal conductivity 
of a mixture at the temperature T and the pressure P is

η* is the gas viscosity at the actual temperature and a pressure of 1 atm, CP

found from (Pedersen and Fredenslund 1987):

to find α0 of the reference component.

This mixing rule will ensure that small molecules with small α values are given more impor￾tance than larger molecules with larger α values. The smaller molecules are more mobile than 
the larger ones and, therefore, contribute relatively more to the transfer of energy than do the 
larger ones.
The calculation of the thermal conductivity of the reference substance, methane, is based on a 
model of Hanley et al. (1975) of the following form:
- p( ,T) - - (T) (T)p - ( , p - T) ( , p T) = + 0 1 + c - - ' + (10.69)Transport Properties 301

thermal conductivity of pure components near the critical point. For mixtures, this term can be 
ignored. The values of the coefficients l1–l7 are given in Table 10.16.
As for viscosities, a “low-temperature term” (Pedersen and Fredenslund 1987) can be used to 
correct the failures of the methane model at reference temperatures with methane in solid form.

10.2.1 Data and Simulation Results for Thermal Conductivity
It has not been possible to find thermal conductivity data for petroleum reservoir fluids or other 
multicomponent hydrocarbon mixtures, but some data exists for binary gas mixtures and for nar￾row boiling petroleum fractions. Table 10.17 shows thermal conductivity data (Christensen and 
Fredenslund 1979) for a binary mixture of CO2 and C1, and Table 10.18 shows experimental thermal 
conductivities (Baltatu et al. 1985) for narrow boiling petroleum fractions. In both tables are also 
shown simulation results with the corresponding states model.

10.3 GAS/OIL INTERFACIAL TENSION
The molecules located in the surface of a liquid in equilibrium with a gas are exposed to forces differ￾ing from those acting in the bulk liquid or gas phases. The attraction from a neighboring gas molecule 
is less than the attraction from a neighboring liquid molecule. The surface layer is in tension and tends 
to contract to the smallest area compatible with the mass of material, container restraints, and external 
forces. The term surface tension, σ, is used for a liquid in contact with atmospheric air and defined as
- =

|
G
A T,V,N
(10.75)
where
G = Gibbs free energy (as defined in Appendix A)
A = surface area
T = temperature
V = molar volume
N = number of molecules
The surface tension can be interpreted as the resistance from the liquid against an imposed increase 
in the surface area. The SI unit for surface tension is N/m. Another common unit is dyn/cm. These 
two units are related as 1 N/m = 103 dyn/cm.
For the tension in the interface between gas and oil, it is more correct to use the term interfacial 
tension than surface tension, as the composition and properties of the gas also influence the tension 
in the interface. Knowledge of the oil/gas interfacial tension is needed to understand the pore-level 
flow processes in a reservoir and is also important for the slip between phases in a dynamic pipeline 
flow simulation.
10.3.1 Measurement of Interfacial Tension
The interfacial tension between an oil and a gas can be determined using the pendant drop tech￾nique (Drelich and White 2002). As sketched in Figure 10.15, an oil drop hanging from a needle

10.3.2 Models for InterfacIal tensIon
Brock and Bird (1955) have shown that the following relation can approximate the surface tension 
of a pure nonpolar component:
- 0 = Ac r (1- T ) (10.77)
where 0 = 11/9, Tr
 is the reduced temperature (T/Tc), and

Pc is the critical pressure in atm, Tc the critical temperature in K, and TBr the reduced boiling 
point (TB/Tc).Transport Properties 305
It is not obvious what Tc and Pc to assign to mixtures, and furthermore it is questionable whether the 
surface tension of a mixture is related to the critical properties in the same way as is the case for a pure 
component. For a mixture, it is more convenient to express the surface tension in terms of phase prop￾erties, for example, densities that can either be measured or accurately calculated. To transform the 
temperature dependence to density dependence, the following approximation is used (Fisher 1967):
p - p - B
L V B (T T c = ' ) (10.80)
where ρL and ρV are the liquid and vapor phase densities, respectively. β is a constant, which for most 
pure components has a value between 0.3 and 0.5. The coefficient B′ has the dimension of density/
(temperature)β. It can be transformed into a dimensionless constant B by rewriting Equation 10.80 
to (Lee and Chien 1984)
p - p
p - L V B
c
B( r = 1 T ) (10.81)
where ρc is the critical density and Tr
 the reduced temperature (T/Tc). Substitution of Equation 10.81 
into Equation 10.77 gives

B/0

B ( ) c c

where Vc is the critical volume and ρL and ρV are the molar densities of the liquid and vapor phases, 
respectively. The molar densities are the densities divided by the molecular weight. The coefficient

c is called the Parachor [P], which allows Equation 10.82 to be rewritten as
- p - p B/0 = [P]( ) L V (10.83)
This equation is often referred to as the Macleod–Sugden relation (Macleod 1923; Sugden 1924). 
The equation can be extended for application to mixtures as proposed by Weinaug and Katz (1943), 
who use β/θ = 1/4

where i is a component index and x and y are mole fractions in the oil and gas phases, respectively. 
For densities in g/cm3, the surface tension is in dyn/cm. For defined components, the Parachors 
have fixed values. Parachors of some common oil and gas constituents are listed in Table 10.19. The 
Parachor of a C7+ component may be calculated from
[P] 59.3 2.34 M i i = + (10.85)
where Mi
 is the molecular weight of the component. In a review article, Ali (1994) has presented 
some other correlations for Parachor.
Lee and Chien (1984) have proposed a second modification of Equation 10.83 with application to 
mixtures. The surface tension is found from
- p p 1/4 = - L V [ ] P P[ ] L V (10.86)306 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

B of the liquid and vapor phase may now be calculated from Equation 10.89 and the liquid and 
vapor phase Parachors from Equation 10.90. The surface tension can be calculated from Equation 
10.86 with the phase densities calculated using a cubic equation of state with volume collection as 
outlined in Chapter 4.
Danesh et al. (1991) found, by analyzing data for interfacial tension of gas condensate systems,

fluid to which considerable amounts of carbon dioxide were added. The composition of the reser￾voir fluid is given in Table 10.21, and the measured results for the surface tensions are shown in 
Table 10.22. Also shown are simulation results obtained with the Lee and Chien and Weinaug–Katz

where DAB is the diffusion coefficient for component A in B, DBA the diffusion coefficient for com￾ponent B in A, and dc /dz A is the concentration gradient of component A in direction z. Similarly, 
dc /dz B is the concentration gradient of component B in direction z. Both diffusion coefficients are 
for diffusion in the z direction. For n-paraffins diffusing in n-paraffins, Hayduk and Minhas (1982)

this expression in simulation of wax deposition at the inner side of a pipeline as a result of molecular 
diffusion. Wax formation is further dealt with in Chapter 11.

Wax Formation
Most reservoir fluids contain heavy paraffinic compounds that may precipitate as a solid or solid￾like waxy material if the fluid is cooled down. Wax precipitation may cause operational problems 
when unprocessed well streams are transported in undersea pipelines, in which the temperature 
may fall to that of the surrounding seawater. Wax may deposit as a solid layer on the inner side of 
the pipeline. With continued transport, this layer will build up and eventually plug the pipeline if 
not mechanically removed. Not all formed wax will deposit on the wall. Some will precipitate as 
solid particles in the bulk phase of the oil and will be transported in suspended form. The suspended 
wax particles will lead to an increase in the apparent viscosity of the oil and thereby affect the flow 
properties. This is further dealt with in Section 11.4.
The wax particles are essentially normal paraffins and slightly branched paraffins, but naph￾thenes with long paraffinic chains may also take part in wax formation. Typical wax-forming 
molecules are sketched in Figure 11.1. Experimental investigations (Bishop et al. 1995) reveal 
that compounds heavier than approximately C50 are rare in solid wax. This has to do with the 
paraffin concentration pattern. Normal paraffins and slightly branched isoparaffins are present 
in considerable concentrations in the lighter C7+ fractions. In the high-molecular-weight frac￾tions, the degree of branching is higher and the molecules therefore less likely to enter into a 
solid structure. Figure 11.2 illustrates the qualitative development in molecular structure with 
increasing molecular weight. Paraffin components with no or little branching are found in high 
concentrations in the lighter C7+ fractions, but low melting temperatures limit the amount of 
lighter C7+ components in the formed wax. The solid wax phase is instead dominated by C20–C50
paraffins.

11.1 EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF WAX PRECIPITATION
11.1.1 Atmospheric Pressure
In 1991, a comprehensive experimental wax study was published in Energy and Fuels
(Rønningsen et al. 1991; Pedersen, W.B. et al. 1991; Hansen et al. 1991; Pedersen K.S. et al. 
1991). This study comprised experimental investigations of wax precipitation from 17 differ￾ent stabilized North Sea oils. The composition of one of these oils is shown in Table 11.1. Wax 
appearance temperatures (WAT) measured using microscopy, differential scanning calorim￾etry (DSC), and viscometry are shown in Table 11.2. When using the microscopic technique 
(Rønningsen et al. 1991), the sample was heated from ambient temperature to 80°C, kept there 
for 10 minutes, and cooled at a rate of 0.5°C/min. The wax appearance temperature was reported 
as the highest temperature where crystals could be observed in a microscope. Rønningsen et al. 
found it necessary to preheat the samples to 80°C to get reproducible WAT results. Other WAT 
measurements using microscopy have been reported by Erickson et al. (1993) and Hammami 
and Raines (1997).
The crystallization taking place when wax is formed from an oil sample is associated with some 
release of heat (exothermic process). Likewise, it requires some heat to dissolve the wax particles 
again (endothermic process) later. These heat effects are used to detect the WAT in a DSC exper￾iment. The DSC technique applied to wax measurements has been outlined in papers by Faust 
(1978), Hansen et al. (1991), and Létoffé et al. (1995). Starting above the WAT, typically at 80°C, 
the oil sample is cooled down at a constant rate. Above the WAT, the heat to be removed from the 
sample with time is almost constant and determined by the liquid heat capacity. At the WAT, the 
heat that has to be removed with time to keep a constant cooling rate increases steeply. This increase 
equals the heat released as a result of the solidification process. When no more wax is formed, the 
heat transfer with time returns to an almost constant level. The same curve is followed for the heat 
to be supplied to the sample to heat it up later at a constant heating rate. A typical DSC curve is 
sketched in Figure 11.3.

Because suspended wax makes the apparent viscosity of the oil increase, the WAT may also be 
determined from measurements of viscosity versus temperature. Starting at a temperature above the 
WAT, a sharp increase in viscosity with decreasing temperature indicates when the WAT is reached.
Ruffier et al. (1993) have reported WAT measurements carried out using ultrasonic equipment. 
The variation in the transit time and amplitude of an ultrasonic signal passing through the sample 
is used to detect the WAT.

The four mentioned articles published in Energy & Fuels in 1991 comprised 14 oils and 3 conden￾sates (all stabilized). The measured WATs can be seen in Table 11.2. The highest observed WAT was 
for one of the condensates (Oil 4 in Table 11.2) and determined using microscopy. As already pointed 
out, C50+ compounds do not to any considerable extent take part in the wax formation. Because the 
molar concentration of C20–C50 wax-forming compounds can be at least as high in a stable conden￾sate as in a stabilized oil, condensates may well have WATs exceeding those of oil mixtures.
Pedersen, W.B. et al. (1991) measured the amount of wax formed from stable oils at different 
temperatures using a pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method. Protons present in the oils 
were excited by a pulse of radio frequency radiation. After the pulse, the decay in magnetization 
was characterized by its signal amplitude obtained 10 and 70 μs after the pulse. The first signal 
was proportional to the number of protons in the solid and liquid phases, and the latter signal was 
proportional to the number of protons in the liquid phase. The NMR signals were calibrated against 
samples of polyethylene dispersed in wax-free oil. Typical data for the amount of wax precipitated 
with temperature is shown in Figure 11.4. The highest wax content found in the 17 stable oils of that 
study was on the order of 15 weight percentage.
11.1.2 Elevated Pressures
The wax study published in Energy & Fuels in 1991 covered in the preceding section did not 
comprise experimental data at elevated pressure, but Rønningsen et al. (1997) later presented high￾pressure data for 65 live oils. The measurements were undertaken using a high-pressure filter 
apparatus, as sketched in Figure 11.5. The oils were pumped through a tubing from a high-pressure 
cell (bottle 1), kept at 80°C through a temperature equilibration coil in series with a bath with a 
temperature control. The temperature of the bath was lowered at a rate of 6°C/hour. The differ￾ential pressure across the filter was recorded continuously. The precipitation of wax caused the 
differential pressure to increase rapidly, and the WAT was interpreted as the temperature at which 
the rise in pressure drop deviated from the normal increase owing to an increased viscosity of the 
oil. The onset temperature is easily detected by plotting the logarithm of the differential pressure 
versus inverse temperature. An example of such plot is shown in Figure 11.6. For each oil, the

percentage of the total oil.316 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
experiments were carried out as a series of experiments in which the gas content was decreased 
stepwise. All the experiments carried out for a particular oil were conducted at the same pressure 
(saturation point of oil sample with the highest gas content). Molar compositions at each stage are 
shown in Tables 11.3 and 11.4 for two of the investigated oils. Experimental WATs for the same 
oils are shown in Table 11.5 and plotted in Figures 11.7 and 11.8. It is seen that the WATs decrease 
with the content of dissolved gas. This decrease is approximately 0.15–0.20°C per mole percentage 
dissolved C1–C5. 
The study of Rønningsen et al. (1997) further comprised a study of the effect of pressure on

increases by approximately 0.02°C per bar, which is in good agreement with data for pure n-alkanes 
(Brockman 1992) and other live oil data (Brown et al. 1994).
Pan et al. (1997) used measurements of the volume as a function of temperature at constant 
pressure to detect the WAT of live oil samples. For an oil above the WAT, the thermal expansion 
coefficient is almost constant with temperature. Below the WAT, the expansion coefficient increases 
with decreasing temperature. This change in expansion coefficient is used to detect the WAT.318 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

Table 11.7 shows the compositions and other data for two North Sea oils. For these two oils, 
Equinor (Rønningsen and Erstad 2023) has kindly made experimental data available for the amount 
of wax formed below the WAT at pressures ranging from atmospheric pressure to 200 bar. The two 
oils were flashed to standard conditions. For each of the stable oils, the n-paraffin concentrations 
(weight percents of stable oil) were measured for C10 and heavier fractions using high tempera￾ture gas chromatography. The results of the n-paraffin analyses are plotted in Figure 11.9. Most 
n-paraffins are found in the interval from C10–C30, and consistent with the observations of Bishop 
et al. (1995), the fractions heavier than C50 only contain traces of n-paraffins. DSC measurements 
were conducted to determine the weight percent of solid wax precipitated from the stable oil as a 
function of temperature at atmospheric pressure. The study further covered live oil mixtures pre￾pared by adding gas of the composition in Table 11.7 to each of the stable oils at room temperature 
(20°C) until the saturation pressure was between 50 and 200 bar. While keeping a constant pres￾sure, DSC measurements were made of the amount of precipitated wax while cooling the fluids to 
−20°. The weight percents of wax formed as a function of temperature were reported and are shown 
in Table 11.8 and plotted in Figure 11.10. The weight percents are of the stable oil.

Other live oil wax appearance temperature measurements have been presented by 
Hammami and Raines (1997), who used a laser-based solid detection system. The authors 
found that WATs measured using the solid detection technique were systematically lower than 
WATs measured using microscopy, a difference that was attributed to the fact that particles 
of some size are needed to detect WATs using the solid detection technique. This study con￾firms observations by Rønningsen et al. (1991) that different WAT measurement techniques 
may give slightly different results. Monger-McClure et al. (1997) have presented an extensive 
experimental study comparing WATs measured by four different experimental techniques, 
these being DSC, microscopy, filter plugging, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) energy 
scattering. The FTIR technique detects cloud points by measuring the increase in energy 
scattering associated with wax solidification. The samples investigated were from the Gulf 
of Mexico, Trinidad, and Oklahoma. The WATs measured were in the interval from 17°C to 
56°C. The cloud points determined by each of the four methods agreed with the average value 
of all methods within 1.7°C.
Table 11.9 shows the composition of a gas condensate (Daridon et al. 2001) for which wax forma￾tion temperatures are shown in Table 11.10 together with dew point data. The data points are plotted

11.2 MODELING OF WAX PRECIPITATION
When wax is formed, some components undergo a solidification process, and when wax disappears, 
the components in the wax phase undergo a melting (or fusion) process. The thermodynamics of 
solidification and melting of a pure component is dealt with in Section 6.3.5. Figure 11.12 schemati￾cally shows a cell with a gas, an oil, and a wax phase in thermodynamic equilibrium. At equilib￾rium, the fugacity of any component i will be the same in each phase:
f f f i
V
i
L
i
S = = (11.1)
The fugacity of a component i in the gas and liquid phases in equilibrium with a wax phase may 
be calculated from the applied equation of state (Chapter 4). The challenging part is how to describe 
the wax phase.
Erickson et al. (1993) stressed the importance of distinguishing between n-paraffins and isopar￾affins. Isoparaffins will have a depressing effect on the WATs because the melting enthalpies and 
melting temperatures of these compounds are lower than those of n-paraffins. Table 11.11 shows 
data (Loebel 1981–1982) for the melting temperature and the heat of fusion for some hydrocarbons 
with seven and eight carbon atoms. It is seen that even for hydrocarbons of the same carbon number, 
these properties may vary considerably. For a given carbon number, the n-paraffin component will 
have the highest melting enthalpy.
The experimental studies presented in Section 11.1 support the idea of Erickson et al. that it is nec￾essary to distinguish between potentially wax-forming compounds and compounds that are unlikely 
to take part in a solid phase formation. A stable oil will be dominated by C10+-components. If all the 
hydrocarbons in a stable oil are assigned melting properties similar to those of n-paraffins, the model 
will predict that almost all the oil constituents will be converted into wax if the fluid is cooled down 
to below the melting temperature of nC10, which is 243.5 K. This does not correspond with experi￾mental observations (e.g., those of Pedersen, W.B. et al. 1991), which show that the total content of 
potentially wax-forming constituents will seldom exceed 15 weight percentage of a stable oil. The 
considerations of Erickson et al. are further supported by the data presented in Table 11.11 for the 
melting temperature and the heat of fusion of some hydrocarbons of similar molecular weight. The 
heat of fusion is lower for the isoparaffins than for the n-paraffins. It can be seen from Equation 6.48

that the heat of fusion (ΔHf
) influences the solid state fugacity through an exponential term. The 
tendency of a component to solidify below its melting temperature will, in other words, increase 
exponentially with its ΔHf
 and be much higher for an n-paraffin than for an iso-paraffin. Erickson et 
al. measured the content of n-paraffins in the lighter C7+ fractions. They estimated the n-paraffin con￾tent in heavier fractions by assuming that the logarithm of the mole fraction of n-paraffins decreases 
linearly with carbon number.
The wax model of Pedersen (1995) as modified by Rønningsen et al. (1997) is based on 
the assumptions that only C7+ components can form wax, and only part of each C7+ carbon 
number fraction contributes to the wax formation. The wax-forming fraction essentially cor￾responds to the n-paraffin fraction. When an n-paraffin analysis does not exist as that plotted 
in Figure 11.9, the mole fraction of wax-forming components contained in a given carbon 
number fraction having the average molecular weight Mi

The density term in Equation 11.2 serves to distinguish carbon number fractions of different wax 
contents. If the density of a carbon number fraction is close to that of the corresponding n-paraffin, 
the density term in Equation 11.2 will approach zero and the wax fraction will approach 1. For 
an aromatic oil, the densities of the carbon number fractions will be higher, and this will reduce 
the estimated wax content. When Equation 11.2 gives a negative value of zi
S , the wax content is 
assumed to be equal to zero.
The model assumes that the wax phase can be described as an ideal solid solution, meaning that 
the fugacity of component i in the wax phase can be expressed as

Experimental observations by Templin (1956) show that the solidification process of paraffinic

to be −10% of the molar volume of hydrocarbon i in liquid form at the same conditions.
The equation of state parameters (Tc, Pc, and acentric factor) of the C7+ components can be esti￾mated using the C7+ characterization procedure of Pedersen et al., as outlined in Chapter 5. As an 
extension to the characterization procedure, the wax-forming and the non–wax-forming fractions 
of the C20+ pseudocomponents are assigned different critical pressures. The critical pressure of the

where Pci is the critical pressure of pseudocomponent i before being split into a wax-forming and a 
non–wax-forming fraction.
By using Equation 11.10, the contribution to the a parameter in the cubic equation of pseudocompo￾nent i divided into a wax-forming and non–wax-forming component will be the same as that of the undi￾vided pseudocomponent. This can be seen from Equation 4.33, showing the classical mixing rule used 
for the a parameter in a cubic equation. Maintaining a constant contribution to the a parameter minimizes 
the effect of the pseudocomponent division on other phase properties, for example, saturation points.
Using Equations 11.9 and 11.10, the wax-forming fraction of a given C20+ pseudocomponent will be 
assigned a lower critical pressure than the non–wax-forming fraction. This is consistent with the fact 
that the critical pressure of an n-paraffin is lower than that of an aromatic or a naphthenic compound of 
the same molecular weight. As exemplified by Rønningsen et al. (1997), neglecting this difference will 
make it difficult to match the experimentally observed depressing effect of dissolved gas on the WAT. 
Simulated WATs obtained for the compositions in Tables 11.3 and 11.4 are shown in Table 11.5 and 
plotted in Figures 11.7 and 11.8 in comparison with experimental observations. Table 11.6 shows a com￾parison of the measured and calculated pressure effect on the WAT of Oil 10c, the composition of which 
is given in Table 11.3. Simulation results for the weight percentage of wax precipitated with decreasing 
temperature for the fluid composition in Table 11.1 at atmospheric pressure are shown in Figure 11.4
(dashed line) in comparison with experimental results obtained using pulsed NMR spectroscopy.
Coutinho et al. (2006) assign the components in the wax phase an activity coefficient differing 
from 1.0. That model, thus, differs from that of Rønningsen et al. by assuming that the wax phase 
is a non-ideal mixture. The term activity coefficient is explained in Equation A.34 in Appendix A.328 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

Table 11.13 shows the gas condensate mixture in Table 11.9, characterized for use with the model 
of Rønningsen et al. (1997). The component fractions from C7 and following are split into a wax￾forming (subscript S) and a non–wax-forming component (subscript no-S). From C7 to C20, Tc, Pc, 
and acentric factor of the wax-forming and non–wax-forming pseudocomponents are identical for 
the same carbon number range. The wax-forming pseudocomponents are assigned a melting tem￾perature (Tf
) and a heat (or enthalpy) of melting (ΔHf
), which, unlike the non-wax-forming compo￾nents, enable them to enter a solid (wax) phase. From C20 and following, the Pc of the wax-forming 
fraction is lower than the Pc of the corresponding non–wax-forming pseudocomponent. The Pc of 
the wax-forming pseudocomponent is found from Equation 11.9 and the Pc of the corresponding 
non–wax-forming pseudocomponent from Equation 11.10. The binary interaction coefficients can 
be seen in Table 11.14. Simulation results for the variation in WAT with pressure for this gas con￾densate can be seen from Figure 11.11, which figure also shows the experimental data.

A PT flash calculation considering a wax phase in addition to gas and oil may be accomplished by 
initially performing a usual vapor–liquid PT flash calculation as outlined in Chapter 6. It is after￾wards to be checked whether the liquid phase from this flash will separate into a liquid and a wax 
phase. If the wax phase is treated as an ideal solution, as suggested by Rønningsen et al. (1997), the 
solid phase fugacity coefficient of component i is independent of composition and can be found from
pi

This gives the following K-factor estimates for the solid/liquid phases (the K-factor as defined in 
Equation 6.4):

where N is the number of components. The K-factors estimated in this manner are inserted into the 
Rachford–Rice equation (Equation 6.22), and the value of β found by solving this equation provides 
an initial estimate of the solid (wax) mole fraction of the total liquid + solid system.Wax Formation 331

 is the mole fraction of component i in the liquid phase from the initial vapor–liquid PT 
flash calculation. New estimates of the liquid and wax phase fugacity coefficients may be obtained 
from the applied liquid and wax phase models. A new estimate of the K-factors can be obtained 
from Equation 11.12, and a new wax phase mole fraction may be determined by solving Equation 
6.22. This successive substitution PT flash calculation is continued until convergence. A new PT 
flash calculation is performed for the mixture consisting of the gas phase from the initial vapor–
liquid PT flash combined with the liquid phase from the liquid–wax PT flash. The liquid phase 
from the new vapor–liquid flash is combined with the wax phase from the liquid–wax PT flash 
calculation and used as the feed in a new liquid–wax PT flash calculation. This calculation scheme 
is continued until convergence. More advanced flash calculation techniques may be applied, but the 
described calculation scheme will usually converge fairly rapidly because the wax phase will have 
a composition much different from the gas and liquid phases.
11.4 VISCOSITY OF OIL-WAX SUSPENSIONS
Oil containing solid wax particles may exhibit non-Newtonian flow behavior. This means that the 
viscosity varies with shear rate (dvx/dy). Table 11.16 shows the composition of stable oil having a 
wax appearance temperature (WAT) of 38°C. Table 11.17 shows viscosity data for this oil measured 
at atmospheric pressure (Pedersen and Rønningsen 2000). At temperatures above the WAT, the oil 
behaves in a Newtonian manner (viscosity independent of shear rate). Below the WAT, the viscosity 
varies depending on shear rate. The viscosity data in Table 11.17 are plotted in Figure 11.14. This

FIGURE 11.14 Viscosities of stable oil in Table 11.16 above and below WAT (Pedersen and Rønningsen 
2000). Below the WAT, the viscosity is influenced by solid wax and behaves in a non-Newtonian manner. The 
actual data points can be seen in Table 11.17.Wax Formation 333
plot illustrates the very pronounced influence that suspended solid wax may have on the apparent 
oil viscosity. It is also seen from Figure 11.14 that the viscosity below the WAT is much dependent 
on shear rate. The viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate. This suggests a Bingham plastic 
flow behavior, which is dealt with in Chapter 10. The impact of solid wax on viscosity is particularly 
pronounced for low shear rates. The restart of a pipeline with a waxy crude oil after shutdown can, 
therefore, be very difficult indeed. In a paper on the rheological behavior of gelled, waxy crude oils, 
Rønningsen (1992) has presented experimental data that may possibly help quantify the problem. A 
model for simulating the restart of pipelines containing non-Newtonian oil with solid wax particles 
has been presented by Davidson et al. (2004).

where ηliq is the viscosity of the oil (not considering the influence of solid wax) and ϕwax the volume 
fraction of precipitated wax in the oil–wax suspension. The parameters D, E, and F can be seen in 
Table 11.18.
11.5 WAX INHIBITORS
Wax inhibitors may be added to waxy crude oils to facilitate transport in undersea pipelines. The 
most commonly used inhibitors lower the apparent viscosity and the pour point. The pour point is 
the lowest temperature at which oil will flow freely under its own weight under specific test condi￾tions (ASTM D-92). During normal operation, the frictional pressure drop in the pipeline increases 
with viscosity. During shutdown, the temperature may drop to below the pour point, and it may be 
difficult to restart the pipeline. Rønningsen et al. (1991) distinguish between the maximum and min￾imum pour points. The latter is the pour point of a sample that has been thermally preconditioned 
at a high temperature (at least 80°C), and the former is the pour point of an unconditioned sample.
Basically, three groups of wax inhibitor chemicals are used:
Wax crystal modifiers
Detergents
Dispersants
The last two groups are surface-active agents, for example, polyesters and amine ethoxylates. 
These act by keeping the crystals dispersed as separate particles, thereby reducing their tendency to 
interact and adhere to solid surfaces.

Viscosity (Equation 11.15)

Crystal modifiers are substances capable of building into wax crystals and altering the growth 
and surface characteristics of the crystal. The crystal modifiers will lower the pour point as well as 
the viscosity. The name pour point depressant is also used for this class of chemicals. Figure 11.15
schematically shows the wax inhibitor (crystal modifier) mechanism. The acetate group (CH3COO—) 
contained in the inhibitor is very unlike the paraffinic branches and will disturb further structuring 
of the paraffinic molecules.
Pedersen and Rønningsen (2003) have presented data for 12 different wax crystal modifiers. The 
data comprise WATs, pour point data, and viscosity data for a waxy North Sea crude oil (wax con￾tent of 15 weight percentage) treated with each of the 12 chemicals in three different concentrations 
(100, 500, and 1000 ppm weight). Table 11.19 shows the types of wax inhibitor chemicals tested. 
The term wax inhibitor is not to be understood as chemicals preventing wax precipitation from oil. 
On average, the WAT of the oil was only decreased by 3.3°C by addition of 1000-ppm wax inhibitor, 
but all 12 inhibitors showed some lowering of the viscosity below the WAT. In general, increasing 
the amount of inhibitor to above 500 ppm had little effect. The most efficient inhibitor was found 
to be No. 12 (mixture of EVA and copolymers of maleic acid anhydride and α-olefin). Figure 11.16

500 ppm of inhibitor (average of all 12 inhibitors).
Pedersen and Rønningsen (2003) have shown that the wax inhibitor effect can be modeled as 
a depression of the melting temperature of wax components within a given range of molecular 
weights. The inhibitor effect of inhibitor No. 12 shown in Figure 11.16 can be modeled by assuming 
that the wax inhibitor depresses the melting temperature of the C21–C40 wax components by 15°C.

Asphaltenes
Asphaltenes is a component class that may precipitate from petroleum reservoir fluids as a highly 
viscous and sticky material that may cause deposition problems in production wells and pipelines. 
Asphaltenes are defined as the constituents of an oil mixture that, at room temperature, are practi￾cally insoluble in n-pentane and n-heptane but soluble in benzene and toluene. The definition of 
asphaltene can be seen from Figure 12.1. The solubility of asphaltenes is also low in other paraffins. 
Because a major part of reservoir fluids consists of paraffins, asphaltene precipitation problems are 
quite frequent. Unlike wax precipitation as dealt with in Chapter 11, asphaltene precipitation is not 
limited to low temperatures. Precipitation may occur in the reservoir, in the production well, during 
pipeline transportation, and in process plants. Gas is often injected into an oil reservoir to obtain an 
enhanced recovery. Because natural gas essentially consists of paraffins, gas injection will tend to 
worsen asphaltene precipitation problems.
Being defined as a solubility class, the term asphaltenes may cover a range of different com￾ponents, and that may be the reason the literature has different suggestions about the nature of 
the asphaltenes precipitating from oil mixtures. Some have in the past considered the asphaltene 
phase to be solid (Kawanaka et al. 1991; Chung 1992; MacMillan et al. 1995), but today the general 
perception is that an asphaltene phase precipitating during oil production is a highly viscous liquid 
(Burke et al. 1990; Godbole et al. 1995; Ting et al. 2003).
Also, there are different opinions about the solubility properties of already precipitated 
asphaltenes. If asphaltenes are precipitated from stabilized oils by the addition of large quantities 
of either n-pentane or n-heptane, it will give asphaltenes in almost pure form, and the cohesion 
between the individual asphaltene molecules may be so high that it becomes difficult to dissolve the 
asphaltenes again. As opposed to these types of experiments, experimental studies of oils precipi￾tating asphaltenes at reservoir conditions (e.g., Angulo et al. 1995; Jamaluddin et al. 2000, 2002; 
Hustad et al. 2014) show that asphaltenes at those conditions may precipitate and dissolve again as 
an ordinary equilibrium phase.
For a constant composition, the solubility of asphaltenes decreases with decreasing pressure. 
For an oil of a fixed composition, the highest asphaltene precipitation is right at the bubble point. 
This is schematically illustrated in Figure 12.2. If the pressure is lowered to below the bubble point 
pressure, some gas will evaporate, and the gas concentration in the liquid phase will decrease. Gas 
components (N2, CO2, C1, C2, etc.) are bad solvents for the asphaltenes. When the concentration of 
gas components in the oil phase decreases, it makes the asphaltene components more soluble in the 
remaining liquid. The asphaltene phase will slowly dissolve and eventually disappear. The pressure 
at which the last asphaltenes go into solution is called the lower asphaltene onset pressure (lower 
AOP). Increasing the pressure from the bubble point will also make the asphaltene phase dissolve. 
Though paraffins are generally poor solvents for the asphaltenes, the solubility of asphaltenes in 
paraffins increases with pressure, and at a sufficiently high pressure, the upper asphaltene onset 
pressure (upper AOP), the asphaltene phase will disappear.
Figure 12.3 shows a typical phase diagram for an oil mixture splitting out an asphaltene phase 
in a pressure band around the bubble point. Not all oil mixtures containing asphaltenes will show 
asphaltene precipitation when pressure is reduced. However, for such oils, asphaltene precipitation 
may occur if gas is added to the oil. Figure 12.4 shows an example in which asphaltene formation 
is not seen until the gas content reaches -8 mole%. The pressure span with asphaltene precipitation 
widens with an increasing amount of gas added.
Asphaltene components are heavy aromatics like the one sketched in Figure 12.5 with a molecu￾lar weight of 500–1000 g/mol (e.g., Koots and Speight 1975; Mullins et al. 2013).

12.1 EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES FOR STUDYING 
ASPHALTENE PRECIPITATION
Experimental studies are the key to a better understanding of asphaltenes as a component class and 
of the mechanisms behind asphaltene precipitation. Much literature on experimental asphaltene 
studies deals with asphaltene precipitation from stable oil mixtures, but techniques have been devel￾oped permitting asphaltene precipitation measurements on live oil mixtures. Tavakkoli et al. (2014) 
have analyzed the various experimental techniques.
12.1.1 Quantification of Amount of Asphaltenes
The nC5 or nC7 precipitation technique (e.g., Burke et al. 1990) is used to determine the asphaltene 
content in a stabilized oil mixture. The n-paraffin is injected in large quantities (e.g., 40/1 n-C5/

oil on a volume basis), which forces the asphaltenes to precipitate. The precipitate is filtered and 
washed to purify the asphaltenes. The information recorded is the amount of stabilized oil, amount 
of injected pentane, and amount of isolated asphaltene. The amount of asphaltene is sensitive to sol￾vent (nC5 or nC7), and because the precipitation is further carried out at standard conditions, there is 
no guarantee that the precipitate is representative of the amount of asphaltenes that potentially may 
precipitate from the live oil at reservoir conditions.
An experimental determination of the asphaltene content is often carried out as part of a SARA 
analysis. S stands for saturates and covers paraffins and naphthenes (see Section 1.1). The first A 
stands for aromatics and covers aromatics with molecular weight below -300. R stands for resins. It 
is a solubility class defined in Figure 12.1, which is dominated by aromatics with molecular weights 
in the range 300–500. Most of the heavier aromatics will be classified as asphaltenes, but depen￾dent on molecular structure (solubility properties), aromatics with molecular weights in the range 
500–700 could also be classified as resins.
12.1.2 Detection of Asphaltene Onset Points
Jamaluddin et al. (2000) have used four different techniques to detect asphaltene onset pressures 
for reservoir oil.
12.1.2.1 Gravimetric Technique
The gravimetric method is conducted in a conventional PVT cell. The temperature is kept fixed, and 
the pressure is reduced stepwise (intervals of ~50 bar). Precipitated asphaltene is allowed to segregate 
at the bottom of the cell. Samples are taken from the upper part of the cell where there is no asphal￾tene precipitate. The sampled oil is flashed to standard conditions, and the amount of asphaltenes 
contained in the oil is determined by n-paraffin precipitation. The amount of asphaltenes contained 
in the oil versus pressure is schematically shown in Figure 12.6. Above the upper AOP, the amount 
of asphaltenes contained in the oil phase is constant. At the upper AOP, the asphaltene content in the 
oil starts to decrease because some of the asphaltenes have precipitated and segregated at the bottom 
of the cell. At the bubble point, the amount of asphaltenes out of solution is at a maximum. This is in 
a gravimetric experiment seen as a minimum in the amount of asphaltenes in solution in the oil (cor￾responding to the maximum in Figure 12.2). Below the bubble point and until the pressure reaches the 
Pressure

FIGURE 12.6 Amount of asphaltenes in solution in oil versus pressure in gravimetric experiment.Asphaltenes 341
lower asphaltene AOP, the amount of asphaltenes in the oil will increase. At the lower AOP, it becomes 
constant and equal to the level above the upper AOP. All asphaltenes are now back in solution. The dif￾ference between the amount of asphaltenes in solution outside the asphaltene precipitation region and 
at the bubble point gives a measure of the amount of asphaltene that will precipitate from the reservoir 
fluid as a result of a depressurization. The gravimetric technique is therefore applicable for measuring 
asphaltene onset pressures as well as for quantifying the amount of asphaltene precipitate. However, 
the technique has the drawback that it is very time consuming (~24 h per data point).
12.1.2.2 Acoustic Resonance Technique
This technique allows the formation of a new phase to be determined acoustically. The new phase 
can be an asphaltene phase (Sivaraman et al. 1997), or it can be a gas phase (at the bubble point). 
The acoustic technique is unsuited for determining the lower AOP.
12.1.2.3 Light-Scattering Technique
The light-scattering technique is illustrated in Figure 12.7. The transmittance of near-infrared light 
through an oil phase is measured. In a homogeneous fluid with no suspended asphaltenes (P > upper 
AOP), light travels through the fluid with minimum scattering. Below the upper AOP, asphaltene 
particles appear and cause partial light scattering. A gradual reduction in light transmittance is seen 
until the bubble point at which total scattering takes place. Approaching the lower AOP, the light 
transmittance starts increasing again, thanks to redissolution of dispersed asphaltene particles.
12.1.2.4 Filtration and Other Experimental Techniques
In a filtration experiment, oil is circulated through a filter at a constant rate. If an asphaltene phase 
precipitates, as a result of either lowering the pressure or injecting gas, the upper AOP can be 
detected as an increased pressure drop over the filter. The technique is similar to that presented for 
wax in Chapter 11. The material retained on the filter is analyzed for saturates (alkanes and naph￾thenes), aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes (SARA) content.
Another method for upper AOP determination is the electrical conductivity measurement technique 
(Fotland et al. 1993). The electrical conductivity of an oil sample is measured continuously as the condi￾tions are changed. For a constant composition measurement, the initial pressure is kept above the upper 
AOP and the pressure is then lowered until a marked shift is seen in electrical conductivity indicating that 
the upper AOP or the bubble point is reached. Below the bubble point, no further recording is possible.
A relatively simple technique for the determination of the asphaltene onset is through viscomet￾ric determination (Escobedo and Mansoori 1995). This detection method is based on experimental 
observations of an increase in the viscosity of a crude oil in which asphaltene precipitation occurs.

12.1.3 Experimental Data for Asphaltene Onset Pressures
Table 12.1 shows five oil compositions for which asphaltene onset pressures have been determined by 
depressurization experiments. The onset precipitation pressures can be seen in Tables 12.2 and 12.3.
Jamaluddin et al. (2000, 2002) have for two oils measured upper AOPs at four different tempera￾tures (see Table 12.2). These onset pressures may give an idea about the development in onset pres￾sure with temperature. One of the oils (Jamaluddin et al. 2002) has a minimum upper onset pressure 
at a temperature of around 120°C. The data in Table 12.2 also includes two lower AOP data points.
Jamaluddin et al. (2002) have also measured onset pressure data for an oil mixed with nitrogen 
in various ratios. This data is shown in Table 12.3. Gonzalez et al. (2012) have studied the effect of 
N2, CO2, and C1 addition to a Gulf of Mexico reservoir oil and have found that the asphaltene onset 
pressure increases significantly when gas is added.
Table 12.4 shows two oil mixtures (Rydahl et al. 1997), which do not precipitate an asphaltene 
phase at any pressure unless gas in injected. It was investigated how much natural gas could be 
injected into the two oils at reservoir conditions before asphaltenes start to precipitate. The results 
are shown in Table 12.4, which also shows the composition of the natural gas injected and the res￾ervoir conditions.
Hammami et al. (1995) have measured the asphaltene onset concentration for a typical live res￾ervoir oil titrated with nC6, nC5, nC4, propane, and ethane. The molar concentration of titrant at the 
asphaltene onset point was observed to decrease approximately in a linear fashion with decreas￾ing molecular weight of the paraffinic solvents. This suggests that one hydrocarbon segment has 
approximately the same influence on asphaltene onset, independent of the size of the molecule it 
belongs to.
Hustad et al. (2014) have reported asphaltene onset and saturation point data for the oil mixture 
in Table 10.14 when adding N2 gas. The data is shown in Table 12.5 and plotted in Figure 12.8.

12.2 ASPHALTENE SCREENING METHODS
Since experimental asphaltene measurements are quite expensive and of limited use for fields with￾out asphaltene problems, screening methods are often used to get a first impression of whether 
production from a certain field can be expected to give rise to asphaltene problems.
De Boer et al. (1995) have made a generalized plot, which is useful to give a first idea about the asphal￾tene precipitation potential of a petroleum reservoir fluid. This plot is shown schematically in Figure 12.9. 
For a given reservoir oil, the asphaltene precipitation potential increases with increasing pressure above 
the bubble point pressure. The higher the pressure, the more asphaltenes can be kept in solution in the oil. 
The second parameter in the de Boer plot is the density of the reservoir fluid (x-axis in Figure 12.9). As 
mentioned in Chapter 1, the density of hydrocarbon constituents of the same molecular weight increases 
in the order paraffins → naphthenes → aromatics. Paraffins are bad solvents for asphaltenes, whereas 
asphaltenes are soluble in aromatics (see Figure 12.1). For this reason, asphaltene precipitation is more 
likely to take place from a reservoir fluid of low density (dominated by paraffins) than from a reservoir 
fluid of high density (dominated by aromatics). This is exactly what is reflected in the de Boer plot. It

Table 12.5. The simulation results are for the SRK equation of state with the fluid characterized as shown in 
Table 12.11.Asphaltenes 345
is noteworthy that the asphaltene content in the reservoir fluid is not a parameter in the de Boer plot. A 
reservoir fluid with a high asphaltene content is also likely to have a high content of lower molecular 
weight aromatics. Aromatics are good solvents for asphaltenes, and no precipitation will take place even 
when the asphaltene content is quite high. This is consistent with the de Boer plot saying that asphaltene 
precipitation is unlikely to take place from high-density (highly aromatic) reservoir fluids.
The Asphaltene Stability Index method is sketched in Figure 12.10. The Stable region with black dots 
represents fluids unlikely to cause asphaltene problems, either because the content of saturates (paraf￾fins and naphthenes) is low or because the content of asphaltenes is low as compared to the content of 
resins. The Unstable region with circles represents fluids that are likely to cause asphaltene problems.

Boesen et al. (2018) have evaluated four commonly used asphaltene screening methods on 36 
reservoir fluids with published asphaltene data. None of the screening methods could identify all 
problematic reservoir fluids, but the SARA-based Asphaltene Stability Index method sketched in 
Figure 12.10 was found to be the most reliable.
12.3 CONSTRUCTION OF ASPHALTENE PHASE DIAGRAMS
Agger and Sørensen (2018) have presented an algorithm to construct complete asphaltene PT and 
Px phase diagrams when an equation of state model is used. Figure 12.11 shows an example of a PT 
diagram generated using this algorithm. The calculation starts by searching for an “asphaltene dew 
point” at a high temperature and a low pressure ( 1 bar), that is, searching for a PT point where a -
gas phase is in equilibrium with an incipient asphaltene phase. This is point A in Figure 12.11. The 
asphaltene saturation point line is followed to point B, where the gas phase has changed character 
to a liquid phase. Here a new incipient gas phase appears. Point B is therefore a bubble point, but a 
special one since the liquid phase is not only in equilibrium with an incipient gas phase but also with 
an incipient asphaltene phase. The bubble point line is followed to point C where the gas and liquid 
compositions become identical, which is characteristic of a critical point but a special one since the 
gas and liquid compositions are in equilibrium with an asphaltene phase. From point C to D, a gas 
phase is in equilibrium with an asphaltene phase and an incipient liquid phase. At point D, the liq￾uid phase and the asphaltene phase become identical, forming a critical composition in equilibrium 
with a gas phase. From point D to B, a gas and a liquid phase are in equilibrium with an incipient 
asphaltene phase (lower asphaltene onset pressure line). The section from point B to E is a normal 
bubble point line with a liquid in equilibrium with an incipient gas phase. On the line from point 
E to F, a liquid phase is in equilibrium with an incipient asphaltene phase (upper asphaltene onset 
pressure line). From point E to G, a liquid and asphaltene phase are in equilibrium with an incipient 
gas phase (bubble point line at which the liquid phase coexists with the asphaltene phase). Finally, 
on the line from point E to H, gas and liquid are in equilibrium with an incipient asphaltene phase 
(lower asphaltene onset pressure line).

12.4 ASPHALTENE MODELING
12.4.1 Fundamentals
Whether asphaltene precipitation takes place from a constant composition fluid at a particular tem￾perature is determined by the pressure. If a pressure depletion experiment is carried out at a constant 
temperature starting at a high pressure with all asphaltenes in solution in the oil, the upper AOP is 
the pressure at which it becomes thermodynamically favorable for the oil to split into two phases. 
As explained in Section 6.3.1, this means that the system can lower its Gibbs free energy by splitting 
out a second phase (here an asphaltene phase) rather than remaining single-phase oil. Recalling the 
fundamental thermodynamic relation (Equation A.24 in Appendix A)
dG V dP S dT = - - - (12.1)
and considering the system at a constant temperature, it is possible to conclude that the total 
volume of the oil and asphaltene phases below the upper AOP is higher than the volume of the 
oil had it remained single phase. A successful asphaltene model must account for this volu￾metric behavior, which is schematically illustrated in Figure 12.12. The mechanism behind 
asphaltene precipitation is therefore not primarily to be sought in interactions between asphal￾tene molecules, for example, asphaltene–asphaltene association. Asphaltene precipitation is 
essentially determined by the reaction of the surrounding medium (the oil) to the presence of 
asphaltene components. If the fluid can increase its molar volume by splitting off an asphaltene 
phase, it will do so. Otherwise, the asphaltenes will remain in solution in the oil. At pressure 
above the asphaltene onset point, the molecules in the oil phase, even though they are tightly 
packed, must make room for the large asphaltene molecules. Had the asphaltenes been con￾tained in a separate phase, the oil molecules would have been more closely packed and the 
molar volume of the oil phase plus the asphaltene phase would have been smaller than with 
asphaltenes in solution in the oil. At lower pressures, the distance between the molecules in the 
oil phase increases, and the asphaltenes have less influence on the oil’s molar volume. At the 
asphaltene precipitation point, the total molar volume would be the same with all asphaltenes 
in solution in the oil and with an infinitesimally small asphaltene phase split off. At pressures 
between the onset pressure and the bubble point of the oil, the total molar volume of the oil 
phase plus a separate asphaltene rich phase is higher than the molar volume would be if all the 
asphaltenes were in solution in the oil.

12.4.2 Models Based on Cubic Equation of State
Rydahl et al. (1997) have presented asphaltene simulations using the SRK equation of state. They 
consider the aromatic fraction of C50+ to be asphaltenes. Having characterized the oil composition 
as described in Chapter 5, each pseudocomponent heavier than C49 is split into an asphaltene and 
a nonasphaltene component. The asphaltene components are by default assigned the properties in 
Table 12.6.

is found from the relation

Equations 12.2 through 12.4 ensure that the equation of state mixture a and b parameters are 
only marginally influenced from splitting up the C50+ components in an asphaltene and a nonasphal￾tene component. This has the advantage that approximately the same bubble point and gas/liquid 
ratios will be simulated before and after the split.
The binary interaction parameters between asphaltene components and C1–C9 hydrocar￾bons are by default 0.017. Binary interaction parameters of zero are default used for all other 
hydrocarbon–hydrocarbon interactions. Tuning the model to an experimental asphaltene 
onset pressure may either be accomplished by tuning the asphaltene Tc and Pc or by tuning 
the asphaltene content in the oil.
An example of a fluid composition characterized for a cubic equation of state using this proce￾dure is shown in Table 12.7 [oil of Jamaluddin et al. (2002) characterized for the SRK equation].

12.4.3 CPA Models
The CPA model is presented in Section 16.1.3. Arya et al. (2015, 2016) have used the CPA model to 
simulate asphaltene precipitation onset conditions for various reservoir fluids with and without gas 
injection. Self-association between asphaltene molecules and cross-association between asphaltene 
and heavy component molecules are considered.
12.4.4 PC-SAFT Models
The PC-SAFT equation of state presented in Section 4.9 is generally superior to a cubic equation 
of state for the simulation of liquid phase compressibilities. As this is a key requirement to an 
asphaltene model, the PC-SAFT equation might be a good candidate for the modeling of asphaltene 
precipitation. This is confirmed by the work of Ting et al. (2007). Figure 12.16 shows an asphaltene 
phase diagram using the characterization in Table 12.12. The match is about as good as that seen 
with the SRK equation of state (Figure 12.13).

but the two latter more complex models did not present any advantages as compared to the classical 
SRK equation.
Abutaqiya et al. (2020) and Mogensen et al. (2023) have successfully modeled asphaltene 
precipitation using the PR equation of state. This further supports that modeling of asphaltene 
precipitation can be done with a classical cubic equation of state and does not require a more 
complex equation.
12.5 PRACTICAL SOLUTION TO ASPHALTENE PROBLEM
Hasket and Tarteral (1965) have presented a practical solution to an asphaltene problem at 
the Hassi Messaud field in Algeria. The composition of the fluid produced from the field is 
shown in Table 12.14. The characterized fluid for use with the SRK equation of state is shown 
in Table 12.15 and the simulated asphaltene phase envelope in Figure 12.17. The asphaltene 
phase envelope shows that the asphaltene deposition happens in a narrow pressure interval 
around the bubble point pressure. Initially asphaltene deposition was seen over a relatively 
broad depth interval in the well as sketched in Figure 12.18. The asphaltene deposition made 
the pressure increase below the deposit and decrease below the deposit. This made the depth 
interval with asphaltene deposition decrease as can also be seen from Figure 12.18. Continued 
asphaltene deposition made the pressure drop over the deposited asphaltene layer increase and 
the velocity of the well stream increase when passing the interval with asphaltene deposit. The 
deposited asphaltene layer effectively acted as a choke with an inlet pressure equal to the upper 
asphaltene onset pressure and an outlet pressure equal to the lower asphaltene onset pressure. 
Because the fluid velocity when passing this natural choke is high, there is not time enough for 
the precipitated asphaltenes to deposit and the asphaltene deposition almost stops. This solution 
cannot be generally applied as it is dependent on the pressure interval with asphaltene precipi￾tation being relatively narrow.356 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

12.6 ASPHALTENE TAR MAT CALCULATION
Chapter 14 deals with compositional variations with depth. The concentration of heavy molecular 
weight components increases with depth. This is a combined effect of gravity and the temperature 
increase with depth. Asphaltenes are high molecular weight components and the concentration of 
asphaltene components will therefore increase with depth. As is illustrated in Figure 12.19, a tar mat 
may be found beneath the oil zone. Figure 12.19 also sketches the mechanisms deciding whether a 
tar mat will be found or not and in which depth it is possibly found. The reservoir pressure increases 
with depth as is illustrated by the full-drawn line in Figure 12.19. The increasing concentration of 
asphaltenes with depth makes the asphaltene onset pressure increase as is illustrated by the dashed 
line in Figure 12.19. At the point where the asphaltene onset pressure and the reservoir pressure 
become equal, the oil zone will end, and a tar mat zone will start.
Simulation of a tar mat is illustrated in Figure 12.20 for the fluid composition in Table 12.16. At a 
temperature of 99°C, the fluid composition has an asphaltene onset pressure of 172 bar. The fluid was 
sampled at a reservoir pressure of 192 bar in a depth of 500 m. As can be seen from Figure 12.20, the 
increase in onset pressure with depth exceeds the increase in reservoir pressure with depth and in a Depth Depth Depth

depth of 581 m the asphaltene onset pressure and the reservoir pressure coincide. Here the oil zone 
stops and beneath is an asphaltene tar mat.
Hirschberg (1988) has reported the presence of a tar mat at the bottom of a reservoir, which 
originates from compositional grading and consists essentially of asphaltenes.

Gas Hydrates
When water approaches its freezing point, water lattices with cavities inside may start to form. 
These lattices will not be stable unless some of the cavities are filled with gas molecules. A water 
structure stabilized by gas molecules is called a gas hydrate. It has an appearance similar to that 
of snow or ice but can survive at temperatures far above the freezing point of water. Methane (C1) 
and carbon dioxide (CO2) are examples of gas components of the right molecular size to stabilize 
hydrate lattices. Gas hydrates may be stable at temperatures as high as 35°C, and the hydrate forma￾tion temperature increases with pressure.
Multiphase mixtures of reservoir fluids and formation water from deep water production are 
frequently transported to onshore or offshore processing plants through undersea pipelines. The 
distance from a petroleum field to the processing plant can be long, and a considerable temperature 
drop may take place. During shutdown, the temperature may drop to that of the surrounding seawa￾ter (~4°C). As the pressures in the pipelines can be quite high, the pipeline conditions may promote 
the formation of gas hydrates. Because hydrate formation may lead to plugging of pipelines and 
ultimately shutdown of production, it is of utmost importance to assess the risk of hydrate formation 
when designing new multiphase transport pipelines.
Figure 13.1 illustrates the phase behavior of a pure hydrate-forming gas component. Line AB 
represents equilibria between hydrate, gas in gaseous form, and ice. Line BC represents equilibria 
between hydrate, gas in gaseous form, and liquid water. Line CD represents equilibria between 
hydrate, “gas” in liquid form, and water in liquid form.
For a mixed gas composition, the situation is slightly more complicated. The hydrate curve may 
possibly intersect the phase envelope of the gas mixture as is illustrated in Figure 13.2. Lines AB,

Makogan (1997), Holder and Bisnoi (2000), and Sloan and Koh (2008) have given detailed 
descriptions of gas hydrates including natural occurrences, experimental investigations, and gas 
hydrate kinetics.
13.1 TYPES OF HYDRATES
Three different types of hydrate lattices may form when gas and oil constituents are in contact with 
water—structure I, II, and H hydrates. Each type of lattice contains a number of cavities of differing 
sizes. Some physical data for each of the two types of hydrate structures are given in Table 13.1. In 
a stable hydrate, gaseous compounds (guest molecules) occupy some of the cavities. Structure I and 
II hydrates contain cavities of two different sizes, small ones and large ones. Structure H hydrates 
contain cavities of three different sizes, small, medium-sized, and huge ones. The small and the 
medium-sized structure H cavities are in fact of approximately the same size as the large cavities in 
structure I and structure II. The terms small and medium sized are used to distinguish them from the 
huge structure H cavities. The cavity structures are sketched in Figure 13.3. Some guest molecules 
may enter into more than one cavity size, but others are limited to just one cavity size. Methane (C1) 
may, for example, enter both small and large cavities of structure I and structure II hydrates as well 
as the small and medium-sized cavities of structure H hydrates. Isobutane (iC4) may, on the other 
hand, only enter into the large cavity of structure II hydrates. Table 13.2 shows what compounds 
of interest in gas and oil production may enter into the cavities of hydrate structures I, II, and H. 
Components like 2,2-dimethyl-propane (2,2-dim-C3), cyclopentane (cC5), cyclohexane (cC6), and 
benzene are called structure II heavy hydrate formers and may significantly influence the hydrate 
formation conditions (Danesh et al. 1993; Tohidi et al. 1996, 1997).

FIGURE 13.3 Hydrate cavity structures.Gas Hydrates 365
Structure H consists of three different cavity sizes. These are conveniently modeled as just 
two cavity sizes, a small/medium-sized one and a huge one. The huge cavity can accommodate 
molecules containing five to eight carbon atoms. The small/medium-sized cavities will usually be 
accommodated with N2 or C1. Structure H hydrates were discovered by Ripmeester et al. (1987) and 
are not as commonly seen during oil and gas production as are structure I and II hydrates. As there 
may be mixture compositions and conditions favoring structure H formation, it is however good 
practice to also consider structure H hydrates when evaluating the risk of hydrate formation (Mehta 
and Sloan 1999).
That a component can enter into more than one hydrate structure (I, II, and H) does not necessar￾ily mean that the pure component will form more than one structure if mixed with water. Methane 
(C1) can, for example, enter into the small and medium-sized cavities of all three structures, and it 
can enter into the large cavities of structure I and structure II hydrates. In pure form, methane will 
form structure I hydrates. Only when mixed with other components can methane enter into struc￾ture II and structure H hydrates. Table 13.3 shows the hydrate structure formed by pure component 
hydrate formers. Normal butane (nC4) and heavier can form hydrates only if smaller components are 
also present. For example, structure H hydrates cannot form from a binary mixture of isopentane 
(iC5) and water. Occupancy of the huge cavities is not sufficient to stabilize the hydrate structure.

Some of the small or medium-sized cavities must also be occupied. This requires the presence of 
small molecules like C1 or N2.
13.2 MODELING OF HYDRATE FORMATION
Hydrates may form when the hydrate state is energetically favorable as compared to a nonhydrate 
state (liquid water or ice). The transformation of water from a nonhydrate state to a hydrate state can 
be regarded as consisting of two steps
1. Liquid water or ice (α) → Empty hydrate lattice (β)
2. Empty hydrate lattice (β) → Filled hydrate lattice (H)
where α, β, and H are used to identify each of the three states considered. The β state is purely hypo￾thetical and is considered only to facilitate hydrate calculations. The energetically favorable state 
(H or α) is the one of lower chemical potential (the term chemical potential is further dealt with in 
Appendix A). The difference between the chemical potential of water in the hydrate state (H) and 
in a pure water state (α) can be expressed as
uu uu u u a B B a
w
H
w w
H - = ( ) - w w + - ( ) w (13.1)
The first term on the right-hand side, u u w
H
( ) - w
B , can be regarded as the stabilizing effect on the 
hydrate lattice caused by adsorption of gas molecules. The difference between the chemical poten￾tial of water in the empty and in the filled hydrate lattice is calculated from

the hydrate lattice, and N is the number of gaseous compounds, which may enter into a cavity in the 
hydrate lattice. The probability Yki is calculated using the Langmuir adsorption theory:

where fk is the fugacity of component k. Cki is the temperature-dependent adsorption constant, spe￾cific for the cavity of type i and for the gas component k. The adsorption constant accounts for the 
water–gas interactions in the hydrate lattice. In the work of van der Waals and Platteeuw (1959) and 
several later works (e.g., Parrish and Prausnitz 1972; Anderson and Prausnitz 1986), the adsorption 
constant C is calculated from a Kihara potential model (Kihara 1953):

R
2 = ( -
(
| )
) | | - (13.4)
where w(r) is the potential function of guest k in cavity i in the radial distance r from the center of 
the molecule. R is the radius of the cell, and k is the Boltzmann constant. The potential function is 
modeled using a Kihara spherical core pair potential. This is a function of r, R, and three Kihara 
parameters specific for each guest component. The Kihara parameters are estimated from experi￾mental data for the hydrate formation conditions.
A somewhat simpler expression for C is (Parrish and Prausnitz 1972; Munck et al. 1988)

For each compound (k) capable of entering into a cavity of type i, Aki and Bki must be determined 
from experimental data.
As can be seen from Equation 13.3, the fugacities of the components occupying the hydrate 
cavities enter into the expression used to calculate ( ) u u w
H - w
B in Equation 13.1. At equilibrium, each 
component will have the same fugacity in all phases. The simulated hydrate formation conditions 
will therefore depend on the fugacities of the hydrate-forming components in the hydrocarbon gas 
and/or liquid phases in equilibrium with the hydrate phase. Component fugacities in hydrocarbon 
phases in equilibrium with a hydrate phase are usually calculated from a cubic equation of state 
(EOS), for example, the SRK (Equation 4.20) or the PR equation (Equation 4.36). The calculated 
component fugacities will differ slightly depending on which EOS is used. This may be accounted 
for by estimating hydrate parameters specific for the selected EOS. Table 13.4 shows hydrate param￾eters for use with the SRK and PR equations.

which for a given P may be used to calculate the hydrate formation temperature, which is the highest 
T for which Equation 13.13 is fulfilled.
The fugacity of pure liquid water may be evaluated from a cubic equation of state. The fugacity, 
fw
± , of water in a mixed liquid water phase may be derived using the methods in Chapter 16. When 
Equation 13.13 is fulfilled, the chemical potential of water in the α-phase equals the chemical poten￾tial of water in a hydrate phase. Taking Figures 13.1 and 13.2 as examples, hydrates may be present 
to the left of the curves, where

w
H
w - < 0 (13.14)
In this equation, μαw is the chemical potential of water in the water phase if no gas hydrates were 
formed and μηw is the chemical potential of water in the hydrate structure.
Whether this hydrate is structure I, structure II, or structure H depends on which of the three 
structures has the lowest chemical potential considering conditions (T and P) and mixture composi￾tion. To the right of the hydrate curves in Figures 13.1 and 13.2,

At equilibrium, no hydrate can exist, and the water will be in the form of gas, liquid, or ice.
It is sometimes questioned whether gas hydrates may form from a gas phase, or a liquid or solid 
water phase is needed to initiate gas hydrate formation. From an equilibrium point of view, nothing 
prevents hydrates from forming a gas phase. What matters is the difference in chemical potential 
between water in the hydrate state and in the phase (gas, liquid, or ice) from which hydrates may

potentially form. However, it may take some time for the water molecules in a gas phase to get 
together and form a hydrate lattice. Hydrate formation may not start until after several hours, days, 
or even weeks. The time it takes from when the conditions are favorable for hydrate formation until 
hydrate formation actually starts is called the induction period (Skovborg et al. 1993), and the dis￾cipline dealing with hydrate growth from the time hydrate formation starts until the system reaches 
thermodynamic equilibrium is called hydrate kinetics.
13.3 HYDRATE INHIBITORS
The chemical potential of water in a liquid water phase, α, may be expressed as (Equations A.31 
and A.33 in Appendix A)

where f stands for fugacity and ϕ for fugacity coefficient. If the water concentration is lowered main￾taining a constant fugacity coefficient, the chemical potential of water will decrease. The water mole 
fraction (xw) may be lowered by adding a substance soluble in water, for example, an alcohol or a glycol. 
By lowering the chemical potential of water in the aqueous phase, it becomes less favorable to form 
hydrates. For a fixed pressure, this means that the hydrate formation temperature becomes lower for a 
diluted water phase than for a pure water phase. Additives used to lower the hydrate formation tempera￾ture are called hydrate inhibitors. They act not only by diluting the water but the fugacity coefficient 
of water (ϕw) may also be lowered as a result of adding a water-soluble substance, which will further 
serve to decrease the hydrate formation temperature. The most commonly used hydrate inhibitors are 
methanol (MeOH) and mono, di, and tri ethylene glycol (MEG, DEG, and TEG). The salts naturally 
found in formation water also act as inhibitors. It has been suggested to add formate salts (Fadnes et al. 
1998) to pipelines transporting hydrocarbons and water to suppress the hydrate formation temperature.
A number of empirical relations exist for calculating the effect of adding a hydrate inhibitor. The 
most well known is the Hammerschmidt (1969) correlation:
w
T
T inhibitor K
MInhibitor

100-
- (13.17)
ΔT is the temperature difference between the hydrate formation temperature if no inhibitor is 
present and the hydrate formation temperature if the water phase contains an inhibitor weight per￾centage of winhibitor. Minhibitor is the molecular weight of the inhibitor, and K is an inhibitor-dependent 
constant. Table 13.6 lists values of K for frequently used inhibitors. These values have been found 
from freezing point depression data for binary mixtures of water and the given inhibitor.
Instead of using a simplified expression to calculate the inhibitor effect, a rigorous thermody￾namic model may be used for the water phase, as is further dealt with in Chapter 16.

13.4 HYDRATE SIMULATION RESULTS
The simulation results in this chapter are based on the hydrate model of Munck et al. (1988). The 
SRK or the PR EOS is used for the fluid phases and the hydrate parameters entering into Equation 
13.5 are taken from Table 13.4.
Figure 13.4 shows experimental and simulated data for the hydrate formation conditions of a 
mixture of pure water and C1. The SRK EOS is used for the fluid phases.
As can be seen in Table 13.3, C1 forms structure I hydrate in pure form. Even though C1 is the 
dominant component in natural gas, most natural gases will form structure II hydrates. Natural gas 
also contains structure-II-forming components such as C3, iC4, and nC4. As C1 only has a slight 
preference for structure I, even small amounts of structure-II-forming components may be sufficient 
to shift the preference to structure II. Figure 13.5 shows experimental (Bisnoi and Dholabhai 1999)

The hydrocarbon fluid was characterized using the procedure of Pedersen et al., as presented in 
Chapter 5. On a weight basis, MeOH is a more efficient hydrate inhibitor than MEG. The molecular 
weight of MeOH is 32.04 and is lower than that of MEG which is 62.07. A hydrate inhibitor pri￾marily acts by diluting the water phase (see Equation 13.16). If the weight amount is the same, the 
number of MeOH molecules will be 62.07/32.04 times higher than the number of MEG molecules. 
This is the primary reason for MeOH being the better hydrate inhibitor of the two on a weight basis.

conditions of the separator liquid in Table 13.9. Hydrate data is shown for a pure water aqueous

Vidal mixing rule (Chapter 16) has been used to simulate the data. The hydrocarbon fluid was char￾acterized using the procedure of Pedersen et al. as presented in Chapter 5. The hydrate curve is seen 
to be steeper above the bubble point of the separator liquid than at the lower pressures with both 
hydrocarbon gas and liquid present.
Figure 13.9 shows experimental (Deaton and Frost 1946) and simulated results for the hydrate 
formation conditions of a five-component gas mixture. The SRK and the PR equations of state with 
the Huron and Vidal mixing rule (Chapter 16) were used in the simulations. Different fugacities are 
obtained depending on which EOS is applied. Even though EOS-specific hydrate parameters are 
used to compensate for fugacity differences, there are still minor differences in the hydrate forma￾tion conditions depending on which EOS is used.
Despite MeOH being a more efficient inhibitor than MEG in the same weight concentration. 
MEG is often the preferred hydrate inhibitor. At 4°C the pure component vapor pressure of MEG is 
around 1.5 × 10−5 bar whereas MeOH at the same temperature has a pure component vapor pressure 
of around 5 × 10−2 bar. Because of this difference, the pollution of the gas phase will be higher with 
MeOH as inhibitor than with MEG.
In colder regions, large concentrations of MEG can be acquired to depress the hydrate￾formation temperature enough to avoid hydrate formation. Hemmingsen et al. (2011) have pub￾lished data for hydrate temperature depressions of a system consisting of 88.13 mol% methane 
and 11.87 mol% propane with MEG concentrations of up to 60 weight percent. The data is 
shown in Table 13.10. In general, the modeling of aqueous systems may require a non-classical 
mixing rule as described in Chapter 16, but a MEG-water mixture can be described well using 
a cubic EOS with classical mixing rules (Equations 4.33 to 4.35) with a H2O-MEG kij of −0.063 
for SRK and −0.065 for PR. PR simulation results for the data in Table 13.10 are shown in 
Figure 13.10.
Processing of gas mixtures may lead to severe cooling. The gas will often contain trace 
amounts of water and the cooling may potentially lead to the formation of gas hydrates. Løkken et 
al. (2008) have determined the water concentration in a natural gas in equilibrium with an incipi￾ent amount of gas hydrates at temperatures ranging from 20°C to −20°C. A gas in equilibrium

13.5 HYDRATE P/T FLASH CALCULATIONS
Hydrate formation cannot always be prevented in pipelines transporting unprocessed well 
streams carrying formation water. It may not be economically feasible to insulate a pipeline suf￾ficiently to stay out of the hydrate region, and there may be environmental or technical reasons 
for not using hydrate inhibitors. Especially in arctic regions and when producing from deep￾water reservoirs, the use of hydrate inhibitors may not be an option, and such fields cannot be 
brought into production unless it is possible to find a way to transport solid hydrates as slurries. 
In these situations, it is essential to be able to quantitatively determine the amount of hydrates 
formed. It is, in other words, necessary to be able to carry out flash calculations (see Chapter 6) 
where at least one phase is a gas hydrate phase. This requires a method for evaluating component 
fugacities in a hydrate phase.
13.5.1 Hydrate Fugacities
A hydrate structure contains water and guest molecules, the fugacities of which may be calculated 
as described in the following (Cole and Goodwin 1990; Michelsen 1991). Only structure I and struc￾ture II hydrates are considered.

13.5.2 Flash Simulation Technique
To make flash calculations considering hydrate phases, the procedures in Chapter 6 must be 
slightly modified. The techniques in Chapter 6 are based on the assumption that the component 
fugacities do not reach extreme values for any concentration. If all the cavities in a hydrate struc￾ture are filled with guest molecules, the addition of more guest molecules will make the fugacity 
of the guest molecules approach infinity. An overloaded hydrate lattice in one of the iterative 
steps of a hydrate flash calculation will make it almost impossible to converge a hydrate flash 
calculation.
For this reason, hydrate flash calculations are made using an “inverse” calculation procedure 
(Bisnoi et al. 1989).
1. Initial estimates are established of the fugacity coefficients of all the components in all 
phases except in the hydrate phases and in any pure solid phases. The hydrocarbon compo￾nents are split between a gas and a liquid phase using the Wilson K-factor approximation 
(Equation 6.13). The K-factor of component i is defined as y /x / i i
L
i
V
i = p p , where yi
 is the 
mole fraction of component i in the vapor phase, xi
 the mole fraction of component i in 
the liquid phase, ϕi
V the fugacity coefficient of component i in the vapor phase, and ϕi
L the 
fugacity coefficient of component i in the liquid phase. The gas phase is assumed to be an 
ideal gas, that is, all component fugacity coefficients are assumed to be equal to 1.0. With 
this assumption, the liquid phase fugacity coefficients become equal to the K-factors. The 
hydrocarbon phases are assumed to be free of aqueous components, and the water phase 
free of hydrocarbons. The component fugacity coefficients in the water are assumed equal 
to those of the aqueous components in pure form at the actual conditions. This corresponds 
to assuming that the water phase is an ideal solution.
2. The phase amounts and compositions corresponding to the fugacity coefficients estab￾lished in 1 are calculated (Michelsen 1988).384 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
3. Mixture fugacities (f , k 1, 2, ..., N) k
mix = are calculated. For a nonaqueous component, the 
mixture fugacity equals the molar average of the fugacities of the given component in the 
hydrocarbon phases. For the aqueous components, the mixture fugacity is set equal to 
the fugacity of the component in the water phase.
4. A correction term 0 is calculated (not to be mistaken for 0 in Subsection 13.5.1), which is 
based on Equations 13.2 and 13.3:
0 = - = -

The superscript H means hydrate phase, and β refers to the empty hydrate lattice. New estimates of 
the component fugacities in the hydrate phase are obtained from

which is derived by combining Equations 13.21 and 13.22. It enables the fugacity coefficient of 
water and other hydrate-forming components to be calculated. To prevent nonhydrate formers from 
entering into the hydrate phases, nonhydrate formers are assigned large fugacity coefficients 
(ln pi
 = 50) in the hydrate phase.
6. Based on the current estimate of the component fugacity coefficients in each phase, a 
new estimate of the phase amounts and phase compositions is established (Michelsen 
1988).
7. If not converged, repeat from 3.
The preceding concept can easily be extended to also handle ice and other pure solid phases. All 
it requires is a fugacity expression for the solid phase as a function of temperature.
Boesen et al. (2014) have presented another approach for hydrate flash calculations. The 
flash algorithm considers the hydrocarbon fluid phases and the aqueous phases (incl. hydrate 
phases) as two sub-systems. Thermodynamic equilibrium exists within each sub-system 
whereas equilibrium between the two sub-systems will develop as a result of component 
exchange between the phases. The algorithm is well suited to study hydrate kinetics but can 
also be used in phase equilibrium calculations when good initial estimates exist. For example, 
in flow simulations a good estimate will often exist from the previous segment or the previous 
time step.
Table 13.14 shows the results of a flash calculation for a natural gas mixed with water and metha￾nol. Four phases are present at equilibrium. As can be seen from the table, not all methanol ends up 
in the aqueous phase. Some is lost to the hydrocarbon phases. This must be taken into consideration 
when calculating the amount of methanol needed to inhibit hydrate formation in a hydrocarbon￾water mixture.Gas Hydrates 385

Compositional Variations 
with Depth
Petroleum reservoirs show variations in pressure, temperature, and composition with depth. This is 
illustrated in Figure 14.1, which schematically shows pressure, temperature, and C1 mole fraction at 
three different depths. Pressure and temperature increase with depth. The concentration of lighter 
components decreases with depth, whereas the concentration of heavier components increases.
Table 14.1 shows typical changes in pressure, temperature, and composition per 100-m vertical 
depth in a petroleum reservoir. Gravity, temperature gradient and viscosity influence the composi￾tional gradient with depth. Capillary forces, convection, and secondary migration of hydrocarbons 
into the reservoir may also influence the gradients, but only gravity, temperature gradient and vis￾cosity will be considered here.

14.1 ISOTHERMAL RESERVOIRS
At equilibrium in a closed system with negligible height differences, the chemical potential (and 
fugacity) of a component i is the same at all positions in the system. The criterion of equal chemi￾cal potentials is, however, not valid for a system with considerable height differences. For such a 
system, height differences must also be considered.
14.1.1 Theory of Isothermal Reservoirs
For an isothermal system, the equilibrium relation for component i in two different depths, a refer￾ence depth, h0, and another depth, h, becomes

where μ is the chemical potential, h stands for depth, M for molecular weight, and g for gravitational 
acceleration. h° is a reference depth. The chemical potential is related to the fugacity through the 
following relation (Appendix A):
d R u =i i T d ln f R= T d ln( ) pi i x P (14.2)

, i = 1, 2, ..., N are known in the reference depth ho, there

h i 1, 2, ..., N = and Ph.
A set of N + 1 equations with N + 1 variables may be solved to give the molar composition 
and pressure as a function of height. Schulte (1980) has outlined how to solve these equations and 
has also given examples of compositional gradients calculated using Equations 14.5 and 14.6 with 
fugacity coefficients derived from an equation of state.
It is stated in Chapter 4 that the Peneloux volume correction (parameter c in Equations 4.43 and 
4.48) does not influence equilibrium phase compositions. This is true for a separator, a PVT cell, 
and other systems at a constant pressure, but not for a reservoir with pressure increasing with depth. 
The fugacity coefficient of component i, derived from the original SRK or PR equations (Soave 
1972; Peng and Robinson 1976) are related to the Peneloux corrected (Peneloux et al. 1982) fugacity 
coefficient as follows:
ln ln c P
RT i,SRK i,SRK-Pen
i p p - = (14.7)
ln ln c P
RT i,PR i,PR-Pen
i p p - = (14.8)
where c is the volume correction term. In a usual phase equilibrium calculation, temperature and 
pressure are the same throughout the system, and the volume correction term cancels out as shown 
in Equation 4.52. This is not the case in a calculation of the compositional variation with depth. The 
pressure and possibly the temperature also change with depth, and these changes are related to the 
fluid density, which property is influenced by a Peneloux correction.
14.1.2 Depth Gradient Calculations for Isothermal Reservoirs
Table 14.2 shows compositions sampled at various depths in a petroleum reservoir (Creek and 
Schrader 1985). The reservoir temperature is reported to be 88°C, and the paper says nothing about 
a possible temperature variation with depth. Using Equation 14.5, the compositional variation with 
depth has been simulated, assuming a constant temperature and starting with the composition at 
the bottom of the reservoir where pressure is 317 bar (read off from figure in the paper of Creek and 
Schrader). Simulated compositions are shown in Table 14.3. The SRK equation with Peneloux vol￾ume correction has been used (Equation 4.43). The fluid was characterized using the procedure of 
Pedersen et al. as presented in Chapter 5. Measured and simulated C1 mole percentages with depth 
are plotted in Figure 14.2 and agree fairly well.
Table 14.4 shows the composition (Whitson and Belery 1994) of a reservoir fluid sample taken at 
a depth of 2635 m, referred to in the following as the reference depth. At this position, the tempera￾ture is 95°C and the pressure 263 bar. Figure 14.3 shows the phase envelope of the mixture in the 
reference depth calculated using the Soave–Redlich–Kwong (1972) equation with the C7+ fraction 
characterized as suggested by Pedersen et al. It is seen that the mixture is a single-phase liquid at 
the sampling point. Further upward in the reservoir, the pressure decreases. By considering Figure 
14.3, it is seen that for a moderate pressure decrease, the mixture will split into two phases. This 
can also be seen from Figure 14.4, which shows how the simulated reservoir pressure and mixture 
saturation pressure develop with depth in an isothermal reservoir. Moving upward in the reservoir 
from the reference depth, the pressure decreases and the saturation pressure increases.

pressure (bubble point) increases because the concentrations of heavier components decrease and the 
concentrations of lighter components increase. At a depth of 2485 m, the reservoir pressure and the 
saturation pressure coincide, and a separate gas phase is in equilibrium with the oil. This position is 
called the gas–oil contact. Right at the gas–oil contact, the conditions are exactly as in a separator 
with an oil and a gas in equilibrium. Below the gas–oil contact there is only oil, and further down in 
the reservoir this oil is gradually enriched in heavy components and stripped of lighter components. 392 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

The gas right at the gas–oil contact is in equilibrium with the oil at this position, whereas the gas 
further upward contains more of the lighter components and less of the heavy components. The com￾positional change with depth is also reflected in the plot in Figure 14.5, which shows the variation in 
gas/oil ratio with depth. The gas/oil ratio has been simulated by a single stage flash to standard con￾ditions (1.01 bar and 15°C) of the reservoir fluid in various depths. In the oil zone below the gas–oil 
contact, the gas/oil ratio is between 100 and 200 Sm3/Sm3 and slightly decreasing with depth. At the 
gas/oil contact, a distinct change is seen in gas/oil ratio. Above the gas-oil contact, the gas/oil ratio is 
10,000–15,000 Sm3/Sm3 and increasing in upward direction.
Figure 14.6 shows the phase envelopes of the fluids at three different depths. At a depth of 2635 m, 
the oil is undersaturated (saturation point is lower than the reservoir pressure (upper ▼ in Figure 14.6)). 
At a depth of 2485 m, the oil is saturated (saturation point and reservoir pressure coincide), and 
there is a gas phase in equilibrium with the oil. The phase envelope of the gas is also shown in 
Figure 14.6. The phase envelopes of the oil and the gas at the gas–oil contact intersect at the res￾ervoir P and T (mid ▼ in Figure 14.6), expressing that both fluids are right at the saturation point.

Finally, Figure 14.6 also shows the phase envelope of the gas at a depth of 2200 m. At this point, 
the reservoir pressure (lower ▼ in Figure 14.6) is lower than the reservoir pressure at the gas–oil 
contact, but higher than the saturation pressure of the fluid in the actual depth. This gas is less rich 
in heavy components than the gas at the gas–oil contact. This is why the dew point pressure of the 
gas in this depth is lower than that of the equilibrium gas at the gas/oil contact.
Figure 14.7 shows how the reservoir pressure and saturation pressure develop with height for 
the reservoir fluid in Table 14.5. The figure has been generated using the same models as in the 
calculations carried out on the mixture in Table 14.4. It is seen that the reservoir pressure and satura￾tion pressure never coincide. Over some distance, the saturation pressure approaches the reservoir 
pressure, but it then bends off and drifts away from the surrounding reservoir pressure. Figure 14.8
shows simulated phase envelopes of the reservoir fluid at three different depths. The corresponding 
phase compositions are shown in Table 14.6. At a depth of 4400 m, the critical temperature of the

mixture is higher than the reservoir temperature. Therefore, at these conditions, the reservoir fluid 
is classified as an oil. At a depth of 4178 m, the mixture-critical temperature is almost identical to 
the reservoir temperature, and the mixture is classified as a near-critical mixture. At 4000 m, the 
mixture-critical temperature is considerably lower than the reservoir temperature, and the mixture 
is classified as a gas condensate. This development in the location of the critical point indicates that 
the fluid at the bottom of the reservoir behaves like an oil. At a position higher up, it becomes near￾critical, and above the near-critical zone, the fluid is a gas condensate.396 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

The change from oil to gas condensate does not take place through a gas–oil contact with a 
discontinuity in the fluid composition, as was the case for the mixture in Table 14.4. As shown in 
Figure 14.9, the gas/oil ratio gradually increases in the upward direction and not through a distinct 
change as was seen in Figure 14.5.
14.2 NON-ISOTHERMAL RESERVOIRS
Field data has shown that only part of the compositional variation with depth can be explained 
by gravity segregation (Montel and Gouel 1985; Pedersen and Lindeloff 2003; Pedersen and 
Hjermstad 2006, 2015). The temperature in most petroleum reservoirs increases with depth, and 
a reservoir with a vertical temperature gradient is not at an equilibrium state. There will be a heat 
and component flux from the deeper (warmer) layers to the colder (upper) layers. As is illustrated 
in Figure 14.10, a positive vertical temperature gradient will increase the compositional variation 
with depth. Also, there is evidence of large compositional variations for reservoir fluids close to 
the saturation point (Fujisawa et al. 2004). The theory presented in Section 14.1.1 is not valid for 
reservoirs with a temperature gradient. In most petroleum reservoirs, the temperature increases 
with depth (-0.02°C per m).
14.2.1 Theory of Non-Isothermal Reservoirs
The equations needed to solve for the molar compositions in a reservoir with a thermal gradient 
can be set up using the terminology of irreversible thermodynamics. To simplify the problem, one 
may assume that the system is in a stationary state. That is, the net component fluxes are zero, and 
the compositional gradient is assumed to be constant in time. Relative to the equilibrium situation 
addressed by Schulte (1980), this constitutes a dynamically stabilized system balanced by the grav￾ity and heat flow effects.Compositional Variations with Depth 397

components to be in the upper (cooler) part.
In a petroleum reservoir with no horizontal gradients, the entropy production, σ, per unit time

The compositional gradient in a reservoir with a known thermal gradient may be determined by 
solving these N equations together with Equation 14.6.
14.2.2 Absolute Enthalpies
To make use of Equation 14.56, it is necessary to evaluate absolute enthalpies. Textbooks on applied 
thermodynamics (e.g., Smith et al. 2001) suggest not to evaluate absolute enthalpies but, instead, to 
evaluate the enthalpy (H) relative to the enthalpy (H0) in some reference state:
H H H H H H abs abs = + = = - 0 0 (14.57)
The reference state can, for example, be the ideal gas state at 273.15 K. Use of H instead of Habs
does not present any problems in heat balance calculations on pure components or mixtures of con￾stant composition. Say a mixture is heated from a state with an enthalpy of Habs
1 to a state with an 
enthalpy of Habs
2 , the enthalpy increase can be expressed as
-H H H H H H H H H abs abs =-= 2 1 2 + - + = - 0
1
0
2 1 ( ) ( ) (14.58)
The reference enthalpy is seen to cancel out and does not have to be evaluated.
The situation in a petroleum reservoir is different. The composition changes with depth, and it 
is necessary to evaluate the absolute partial molar enthalpies. Whether a positive T-gradient with 
depth according to the Haase model will weaken or strengthen a compositional gradient will depend 
on the variation in reference enthalpy with component molecular weight.404 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
Pedersen and Hjermstad (2006) have suggested the reference enthalpies in Table 14.7. They used 
the ideal gas state at 273.15 K as reference state, meaning that the absolute ideal gas enthalpies in 
Table 14.7 are ideal gas enthalpies at 273.15 K per mass unit.
Figure 14.11 illustrates how two different molecules will react to an external heat source. The smaller 
molecule has the lower ideal gas enthalpy per mass unit than the larger one and will convert a major part

14.2.3 Depth Gradient Calculation for Non-Isothermal Reservoir
Pedersen and Hjermstad (2015) have presented data for the compositional variation with depth in five 
petroleum reservoirs. A summary of the data for two of the reservoirs is given in Table 14.8 together 
with viscosity data for the fluid composition at reservoir conditions. Also shown is the fraction of aro￾matic components in the C7+ fraction of each of the reference fluids (Nes and van Westerns 1951). The 
depths in Table 14.8 are relative to the depth in which the upper fluid sample was taken. Table 14.9

characterized to a common EoS model (Section 5.6) for use with the volume-corrected PR equation 
(Equation 4.48). The binary interaction parameters are found in Table 14.11. A depth gradient simula￾tion is carried out for the fluid in Table 14.10 from a depth of 175 m. Figure 14.12 shows experimental Compositional Variations with Depth 407
and simulated data for the development of reservoir pressure and saturation pressure with depth. The 
simulation results on the upper plot are generated ignoring the vertical temperature gradient, while 
the lower plot shows the simulations for a vertical temperature gradient of 0.025°C/m.
Espósito et al. (2017) have presented more data for the compositional variation with depth in 
petroleum reservoirs.
14.3 HEAVY OIL RESERVOIRS
As can be seen in Table 14.8, the viscosity of the reference fluid in Reservoir 5 is about five times 
higher than the viscosity of the reference fluid in Reservoir 1, and the change in saturation pressure per 
unit depth is almost ten times higher in Reservoir 5 than in Reservoir 1. One of the assumptions behind 
the Haase model presented in Section 14.2.1 is that there is an unhindered flux of molecules back and 
forth between the warmer bottom to the colder top. This assumption will not always hold. In the same 
medium, a molecule of a high molecular weight molecule will move (diffuse) at a lower rate than a 
molecule of a lower molecular weight. This applies to both gas (Graham 1846) and liquid phases but 
is more pronounced in a liquid environment. Hayduk and Minhas (1982) have proposed the following 
FIGURE 14.12 Experimental and simulated reservoir and saturation pressures versus depth for Reservoir 1 
in Pedersen and Hjermstad (2015). Equation 14.56 has been used with fugacity coefficients derived from the 
volume-corrected PR equation with the EoS model parameters in Table 14.10 and the Hi
ig values in Table 14.7. 
A vertical temperature gradient of 0.025 C/m is used in the simulations.408 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

The exponent in the viscosity term is negative, meaning that the diffusion coefficient for viscosities 
exceeds 1.0 will decrease with increasing viscosity of the surrounding media. The rate a given heat 
supply imparts a molecule will therefore be lower in a more viscous medium than in a less viscous 
medium, and the difference between the speed of movement between a low and a high molecular 
weight component will increase with the viscosity of the fluid medium. Figure 14.13 illustrates the

FIGURE 14.13 Schematic illustration of how smaller and larger molecules will diffuse in a reservoir oil 
zone with a vertical temperature gradient. The diffusion rate decreases with molecular size, and the net result 
is that the kinetic energy transferred to the heavier molecules will be insufficient to have all of them circu￾late in the total fluid column as is the case for the lighter molecules. A fraction of the heavier molecules will 
instead only circulate at the bottom of the reservoir.Compositional Variations with Depth 409
impact of high molecular weight components diffusing at a lower rate than low molecular weight 
components. The high molecular weight components will circulate at the bottom of the reservoir, 
while the low molecular weight compounds have sufficient kinetic energy to reach the top of the 
reservoir before the lower temperature at the top makes them seek down again.
Not only does the fluid in Reservoir 5 have a high viscosity; as can be seen in Table 14.8, it also 
has a high concentration of aromatic components. This suggests that the attenuation of the molecu￾lar motion seen in highly viscous reservoirs is further enhanced if the fluid has a high concentration 
of aromatic components.
14.3.1 Viscosity Correction
To account for the impact of viscosity and aromaticity on the compositional variation with depth,

VISFAC is a correction factor to take into account that molecules of different sizes move at different 
rates in a fluid column and that the difference in rate of movement increases with viscosity and with 
concentration of aromatic components. VISFAC is found from the following expression:
VISFAC = x 16 875 . . n + x 5 0 AFRAC - 3 375 . (14.61)

AFRAC is the fraction of the C7+ components that are aromatics, and η is the fluid viscosity in cP.
14.3.2 Depth Gradient Calculation for Heavy Oil Reservoirs
Vinhal et al. (2021) have presented a depth gradient simulation for Reservoir 5 in Pedersen and 
Hjermstad (2015) using Equation 14.60. The measured and simulated fluid compositions at the sam￾pling depths are shown in Table 14.12 and the experimental and simulated variations in reservoir 
pressure and saturation pressure with depth can be seen from Figure 14.14. The figure also shows 
the simulation results of using Equation 14.56, which equation considers the vertical temperature 
gradient but not the viscosity effect. A comparison of the two plots shows the importance of consid￾ering the viscosity effect for heavy aromatic reservoir fluids. Taking that into consideration makes 
it possible to simulate the very significant compositional variation seen in this fluid column over a 
depth interval of only 28 m.
Rodriguez et al. (2007) have presented data for the compositional variation with depth in a 970 
m fluid column in the Carito-Mulata field in Venezuela. Two of the fluids are shown in Table 14.13
with a common EoS model developed for the volume-corrected SRK equation (Vinhal et al. 2021). 
Saturation points measured on samples from the field are shown in Table 14.14. A depth gradient 
calculation was carried out with the fluid in a depth of 3882.5 m as reference fluid assuming a ver￾tical temperature gradient of 0.025°C/m and using Equation 14.60 to represent the compositional 
grading. Experimental and simulated variations in reservoir pressure and saturation pressure with 
depth can be seen from Figure 14.15. The figure also shows the simulation results of using Equation 
14.56, which ignores the viscosity effect. The viscosity effect must be considered to get a good 
match of the compositional grading.410 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

Gas Injection EOR
Figure 15.1 shows a sketch of a reservoir produced through natural depletion. The reservoir pressure 
will fall as production goes on and material is removed from the reservoir. The pressure will eventu￾ally reach the saturation pressure at which gas will start to form, as is illustrated in the right-hand 
sketch of Figure 15.1. From that time on, the majority of the production is likely to come from the 
gas phase. The gas contains fewer liquid components than the oil, and the final recovery may end up 
being only a few percent of the total oil in place.
The term enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is used to describe various processes applied to increase 
hydrocarbon recovery from petroleum reservoir fields to a level above that of natural depletion. 
Injection of water, gas, and water alternating gas are the most applied EOR techniques. For fields 
with a heavy and highly viscous oil, injection of steam or steam mixed with solvent (expanding 
solvent—steam assisted gravity drainage (ESSAGD)) can also be applicable.
Injection gases may either be hydrocarbon gases originating from production of oil or gas con￾densate fluids or the injection gas can be carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is an effective injection gas, and 
there may also be environmental reasons in favor of CO2.
In the upper sketch of Figure 15.2, oil is being displaced by a gas by a piston-like effect. The 
lower sketch shows an injection gas penetrating the oil phase and making its way to the production 
well where it will cause an early gas breakthrough. None of the scenarios in Figure 15.2 gives a true 
picture of the displacement mechanisms.

FIGURE 15.1 Reservoir oil produced by natural depletion.
FIGURE 15.2 Piston-like gas displacement (upper) and early gas breakthrough (lower). None of those pro￾cesses correspond with reality.Gas Injection EOR 415
In reality, the injected gas will, as illustrated in Figure 15.3, mix with the reservoir fluid and 
influence the oil–gas phase equilibrium in the reservoir. The gas may selectively take up compo￾nents from the oil phase (vaporizing mechanism), the oil may take up components from the gas 
phase (condensing mechanism), or both oil and gas take up components from the other phase (com￾bined vaporizing/condensing drive).
15.1 THREE-COMPONENT MIXTURES
Much of the classical literature on miscible gas displacement is based on consideration of three￾component mixtures and ternary diagrams (e.g., Stalkup 1984). Figure 15.4 shows a ternary diagram 
for a mixture of C1, C4, and C10. The diagram is for a fixed pressure and temperature. Each corner 
in the diagram represents 100% of a given component. Any concentration between 0% and 100% is 
represented as a proportionate distance between the bottom of the triangle and the opposite corner. 
Point A in Figure 15.4 corresponds to an oil mixture and point B to a heavy gas mixture. Also shown 
in Figure 15.4 is the location of the two-phase area. The dashed lines are tie-lines connecting gas and 
liquid compositions in thermodynamic equilibrium.
The tangent to the two-phase area in the critical point (or plait point) is called the critical tie-line. 
Whether miscibility can be achieved is determined by the position of the initial oil and gas composi￾tions relative to the critical tie-line. One may distinguish between the following cases:
1. First contact miscibility. An oil and a gas composition made up of the same three com￾ponents will be miscible by first contact if the line connecting the two compositions in a 
ternary diagram does not intersect the two-phase area. This is the situation for oil mixture 
A and gas mixture B in Figure 15.4. Mixtures of the oil and gas will be single-phase, 
independent of mixing ratio.
2. Vaporizing drive. This principle is illustrated in Figure 15.5. The composition of the 
injection gas is located on the two-phase side of the critical tie-line and the composi￾tion of the original oil on the single-phase side. The line connecting the oil and gas 
composition intersects the two-phase area. Miscibility between the oil and the injec￾tion gas may be achieved through a vaporizing process. When the original oil is mixed 
with an appropriate amount of injection gas, two phases are formed. The equilibrium 
phases can be represented as two points on the borderline between the single and 
two-phase areas in the ternary diagram. The two points are connected by a tie-line in 
Figure 15.5. The new gas composition may contact original reservoir oil, and a new 
gas phase will form. It will contain more heavy components and have a composition 
more like the composition at the critical point. At some stage, the gas composition may 
become equal to that at the critical point, and this critical phase is miscible with the 
original oil. This means that only one phase will form, no matter in what proportion

the critical mixture and the oil are mixed. The oil and the gas are said to be miscible as 
a result of a vaporizing multicontact process. The term vaporizing is used because the 
gas is gradually enriched with intermediate-molecular-weight components from the oil 
phase. The vaporizing process is illustrated in a reservoir context in Figure 15.6. The 
injection gas contacts oil at the injection well, and it takes up intermediate-molecular￾weight components from the oil. Because the gas has a higher mobility than the oil, it 
is pushed away from the injection well by new injection gas, whereas the oil, which is 
less mobile, is almost stagnant. Away from the injection well, the enriched injection 
gas contacts fresh oil, takes up more components from the oil, and so on until, after 
multiple contacts in some distance from the injection well, the enriched gas and the 
original oil become fully miscible. As can be seen from Figure 15.6, miscibility, for a 
vaporizing drive, develops at the gas–oil front.
3. Condensing drive. The principle is illustrated in Figure 15.7. The composition of the origi￾nal reservoir fluid (oil) is on the two-phase side of the critical tie-line and the composition of 
the injection gas on the single-phase side. The line connecting the oil and gas compositions 
intersects the two-phase area. When the oil is mixed with an appropriate amount of injection 
gas, two phases are formed. The oil will take up intermediate-molecular-weight components 
from the gas phase, and its composition will be more like that at the critical point. If the oil 
that has already taken up gaseous components is contacted by fresh injection gas, some of 
the heavier components in the gas will again condense into the oil phase, and the composi￾tion of the oil will at some stage become equal to that at the critical point. Miscibility has 
been achieved, because the now-critical “oil” will be miscible with the injection gas in all 
ratios. The condensing process is illustrated in a reservoir context in Figure 15.8. The injec￾tion gas contacts oil at the injection well. The oil takes up intermediate-molecular-weight 
components from the gas. The stripped gas is pushed away from the injection well by new 
injection gas. Some of the heavier components in this gas will condense into the oil phase. 
After a number of contacts, miscibility develops at the injection well.
4. Miscibility cannot be achieved. If the injection gas and reservoir oil compositions are both 
located on the two-phase side of the critical tie-line, miscibility cannot be achieved. This 
situation is illustrated in Figure 15.9. Gas

Ternary diagrams represent the phase equilibrium picture at a fixed temperature and pressure. 
Figure 15.10 illustrates qualitatively the development in the two-phase area with pressure. The size 
of the two-phase area decreases with increasing pressure, meaning that miscibility is more easily 
achieved at higher pressures. The lowest pressure, where at a fixed temperature, miscibility can be 
achieved between a given reservoir fluid and a given injection gas, is called the minimum miscibility 
pressure (MMP). The lowest pressure at which the reservoir oil and the injection gas are miscible 
by first contact as in Figure 15.4 is called the first contact minimum miscibility pressure (FCMMP).Gas Injection EOR 419

15.2 MMP OF MULTICOMPONENT MIXTURES
Ternary diagrams are inapplicable for mixtures with four or more components. As exemplified by 
Pedersen et al. (1986) and Zick (1986), the two-phase area is undefined in a ternary diagram for a 
mixture with more than three components. Another deficiency is that a ternary diagram only con￾siders purely vaporizing and purely condensing drives and not the combined vaporizing/condensing 
mechanism, which for most gas–oil systems determines the miscibility pressure.
15.2.1 First Contact MMP
Figure 15.11 shows the saturation pressure of the reservoir oil in Table 15.1 for a temperature of 
73°C, and the influence on the saturation pressure of adding gas of the composition also given in 
Table 15.1. The simulations have been carried out using the SRK equation of state, and the oil was 
characterized using the procedure of Pedersen et al. as presented in Chapter 5. The highest satura￾tion pressure is 1074 bar and seen for a gas mole percentage of 92.6. This pressure is the FCMMP. 
At higher pressures, two phases cannot form, regardless of the ratio in which oil and gas are mixed. 
Mogensen and Goryachev (2022) have reported a fluid system with high concentrations of H2S in 
both reservoir oil and injection gas for which the FCMMP would be achievable in the considered 
reservoir. Most often the FCMMP is much higher than the reservoir pressure, but, as described in 
the following, a miscible drive can, for most reservoir fluids, as a result of a multi-contact process, 
be achieved at a much lower pressure than the FCMMP.
15.2.2 Tie-Line Approach
As was first pointed out by Zick (1986) and Stalkup (1987), the drive for a multicomponent mixture 
(N > 3) can be combined vaporizing and condensing. This means that the component exchange 
upon contact between gas and oil is not one-way. The reservoir oil takes up components from the 
gas and the gas takes up components from the oil. With a combined vaporizing/condensing drive, 
miscibility develops at a position in the reservoir between the injection well and the gas–oil front. 
The miscible oil and gas compositions are equal and at their critical point. Miscibility as a result of 
a combined vaporizing/condensing mechanism is illustrated in Figure 15.12.

FIGURE 15.12 Miscibility obtained through a combined vaporizing and condensing drive. Miscibility 
develops at a position between injection well and gas–oil front.422 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
An algorithm that can successfully determine the multicontact MMP for a reservoir oil mixture 
and an injection gas must consider three different mechanisms for exchange of components between 
oil and injection gas, these being vaporizing, condensing, and combined vaporizing/condensing. 
The three mechanisms are illustrated in Figure 15.13. Transfer of intermediate-molecular-weight 
components (typically C3–C6) from the oil phase to the gas phase is the dominant mechanism for a 
vaporizing drive. With a condensing drive, intermediate-molecular-weight components from the gas 
phase condense into the oil phase. When the drive is combined vaporizing/condensing, components 
are transported either way. Some components from the gas phase will condense into the oil, and 
components from the oil phase will vaporize into the gas phase.
In a reservoir with gas injection and a fluid system represented by N components, N-1 composi￾tional constant composition zones will develop (Monroe et al. 1990) as sketched in Figure 15.14. The 
zones move with time, leaving gas behind, as is illustrated in the lower sketch of Figure 15.14. A small 
irreducible oil matrix may persist near the injector (not shown in Figure 15.14). Miscibility develops 
when the gas and liquid compositions in one of the zones become identical and the fluid composition 
in that zone is at its critical point. At the gas/oil contact, gas contacts fresh oil. The gas contacting the 
fresh oil has already contacted oil multiple times. The tie-line connecting the equilibrium gas and oil at 
the gas/oil front will extend through the fresh oil composition. Mathematically this can be expressed as

where β can take values from minus infinity to plus infinity. The superscript oil refers to original 
reservoir oil. If the length of this tie-line becomes zero, the equilibrium gas and oil compositions 
at the gas/oil front are identical. The fluid is at its critical point and a miscible drive has developed. 
When a miscible drive develops at the gas–oil front, the drive is 100% vaporizing.

At the inlet, fresh injection gas contacts oil that after some time has already been contacted many 
times by fresh gas. The tie-line connecting the equilibrium gas and oil compositions will extend 
through the injection gas. Mathematically this can be expressed as

expressed through the mole fractions in Equation 15.2 becomes zero, the equilibrium gas and oil 
compositions at the injection well are identical. The fluid is at its critical point and a miscible drive 
has developed. This drive is 100% condensing. Condensing drives are mainly of theoretical interest. 
A 100% condensing drive has never been reported in literature for a real case.
At the shift from one compositional zone to the next one in Figure 15.14, the total composition 
must be some mathematical combination of the phase compositions in each of the two neighboring 
zones. This is expressed as

These N-3 equations represent N-3 so-called crossover tie-lines connecting the initial oil tine line 
in Equation 15.1 and the injection gas tie-line in Equation 15.2. Equation 15.3 expresses that each 
crossover tie-line intersects the tie-line just upstream and the tie-line just downstream.
Johns and Orr (1997) and Wang and Orr (1997, 1998) have presented an algorithm for solving 
Equations 15.1 through 15.3 starting with a relatively low pressure (could be 50 bar). Once the N-1 
key tie-lines have been found for a given pressure, the MMP can be determined by increasing the 
pressure in increments until one of the key tie-lines becomes a critical tie-line (length of zero). 
Equation 15.3 must be solved subject to the equilibrium constraint

The multicomponent tie-line calculation procedure can be summarized as follows:
1. Initially solve Equations 15.1 and 15.2.
2. To obtain a set of intersecting tie-lines, Equations 15.3 through 15.5 are solved for a given 
temperature (typically reservoir temperature) and a (low) pressure.
3. The pressure is increased slightly. The equations in 1 and 2 are solved again using the solu￾tion for the previous pressure as initial estimate.
4. Step 3 is repeated until one of the tie-lines shrinks to a point (length L of zero) which 
condition is fulfilled for tie-line n if

The pressure where this happens is the MMP. When the length is zero, the tie-line connects two 
identical critical compositions.
Figure 15.15 schematically shows the development towards miscibility for an 8-component sys￾tem. The x-axis represents the distance from the injection well and the y-axis the gas and liquid den￾sities. At a pressure of 150 bar, the constant composition zones have developed, but in all N-1 (=7) 
zones the liquid density is significantly higher than the gas density. At a pressure of 190 bar the 
phase densities in zone 6 are almost equal signaling a tie-line length approaching zero and a near 
critical fluid composition. The fluid has reached miscibility and the MMP is 190 bar. Miscibility 
develops in a zone between the 1st (injection gas) tie-line and the last (original oil) tie-line. The drive 
is therefore combined vaporizing-condensing.
Jessen et al. (1998) have presented a modification of the preceding algorithm, with focus on 
speed and numerical robustness.

Johns et al. (2002) have suggested a method to quantify the displacement mechanisms. On 
each tie-line, the point for which the vapor mole fraction β equals 0.5 is located. The term d1 is 
used for the distance from the β = 0.5 point on the oil tie-line to the β = 0.5 point on the second 
tie-line. The distance is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences 
between the component mole fractions on the first and second tie-lines for β = 0.5. The term 
d2 is used for the distance from the latter point to the β = 0.5 point on the third tie-line, and 
so on. For a four-component mixture, the third tie-line is the last one (the one passing through 
the injection gas). For a four-component mixture, the fraction of the drive that is vaporizing is 
given by

where dk,v is nonzero for tie-lines for which the displacement mechanism between that tie-line and 
the next one is vaporizing. This is the case if the tie-lines are longer in the direction toward the gas 
tie-line than in the direction toward the oil tie-line.
In most cases a slim tube experiment (Section 3.2.4) carried out at the MMP will show a recovery 
of 90–95%. Often the reservoir conditions do not permit gas injection at a pressure as high as the 
MMP. Gas injection may still be favorable, and it is of interest to know the recovery for pressures 
between the saturation pressure of the original oil and the MMP. As an alternative to carrying out 
a slim tube experiment, an approximate recovery can be simulated using an algorithm of Jessen 
et al. (2001).
Slim tube data is shown in Table 3.48 for the oil in Table 3.47 with CO2 as injection gas. As is 
seen from Figure 3.25, the experimental MMP was 208 bar for a temperature of 85.7°C. The MMP 
of this system was simulated using a combined vaporizing/condensing MMP algorithm and the 
SRK equation of state. The characterized fluid composition is shown in Table 15.2 and the nonzero 
binary interaction coefficients in Table 15.3. The MMP was simulated to 209 bar, which is close to 
the experimentally determined MMP.
Other experimental slim tube data is shown in Tables 15.4 and 15.5 (Glasø 1985; Firoozabadi 
and Aziz 1986). Simulated MMPs for these systems are shown in Table 15.6. The simulated 
MMPs for these systems are generally 5%–15% lower than the experimentally determined slim 
tube MMPs.
The literature about miscible displacement and determination of MMP by analytical methods is 
based on theories developed for fluid dynamics and chromatography. Helfferich (1981) has given a 
good introduction to the terms and assumptions used in the literature about combined vaporizing/
condensing gas displacement.
15.2.3 Immiscible Systems
Not all gas–oil systems will have an MMP. Some combinations of gas and oil will after multiple con￾tacts develop a liquid–liquid system, which is immiscible independent of pressure. With CO2 as injec￾tion gas, both phases will be rich in CO2, but one will have a substantially higher concentration of C7+426 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

than the other one. The recovery versus pressure for an immiscible system will not have the distinct 
bend as shown in Figure 3.24. The recovery curve will be more rounded as the one in Figure 15.16. 
When no bend is seen on the recovery curve, it is common practice in industry to take the pressure 
at which the recovery is 90%–95% as the MMP. Many of such systems may in fact be immiscible.
Table 15.7 shows an oil composition sampled from a reservoir with a temperature of 48.6°C

Table 15.8 and plotted in Figure 15.17. Tube lengths of 9.1 m and 18.3 m were used. No sharp bend 
is seen on the recovery versus pressure curve suggesting that miscibility was not achieved.

phase envelope. Below a temperature of around 50°C, the saturation pressure is seen to increase 
with decreasing temperature. That is a clear indication of the presence of two liquid phases, which 
independent of pressure will not develop miscibility. This explains why miscibility did not develop 
in the slim tube experiment. Because the two liquid phases have approximately the same mobility, 
the recovery is high despite the system being immiscible. A tie-line algorithm as outlined in Section 
15.2.2 will (correctly) fail to find a solution.
The phase envelope in Figure 15.18 was simulated using the SRK equation. The applied eight￾component EoS model description is shown in Tables 15.9 and 15.10.
15.2.4 Cell-to-Cell Simulation
A cell-to-cell simulator (slim tube) as first suggested by Metcalfe (1972) is useful to give a detailed 
picture of the phase behavior with a multi-stage contact between gas and oil.
The starting point is a series of cells of equal volume placed in a row. Each cell is filled with 
reservoir oil at the reservoir temperature and a fixed pressure above the saturation pressure. A 
specified amount of gas is added to cell 1. It is assumed that perfect mixing takes place and ther￾modynamic equilibrium is reached. This means that the conditions in the cell can be found by a 
PT flash calculation as described in Chapter 6. As the injected gas and the cell fluid mix, the gas 
plus liquid volume will be larger than the initial cell volume. The excess volume is transferred to

cell 2. Metcalfe et al. have, as illustrated in Figure 15.19, used three different criteria for defining 
the excess volume:
1. Stagnant oil: All the gas formed in cell 1 is transferred to cell 2, whereas all the oil remains 
in cell 1.
2. Moving excess: All the gas formed in cell 1 is transferred to cell 2. If the volume of the 
remaining oil phase exceeds that of the original cell, the excess volume of oil is also trans￾ferred to cell 2.
3. Phase mobility criterion: The cell volume remains constant throughout the calculation, 
and the excess volume is transferred to cell 2. If two phases are present, gas and liquid are 
moved according to their relative phase mobilities:

simulation.432 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
In Equation 15.8, kro and krg are the relative oil and gas phase permeabilities, respectively; ηo is 
the oil viscosity; and ηg the gas viscosity. Relative permeabilities are determined experimentally 
by gas and oil flooding through core samples (see, e.g., Dandekar 2013). An example of rela￾tive permeability curves is given in Figure 15.20. If no relative mobility data exists, a viscosity 
mobility criterion may be used instead. The relative mobility of oil and gas is simply expressed 
as the ratio of the oil and gas volume fractions times the ratio of the gas and oil viscosities. For 
liquid–liquid displacement, it may actually be more correct to use the viscosity mobility crite￾rion because any relative permeability data would be measured on a gas–liquid system and not a 
liquid–liquid system.
The excess volume from cell 1 is transferred to cell 2 and a PT flash calculation is performed 
on the total cell mixture (phase equilibrium assumed to develop). The excess volume from cell 2 
is transferred to cell 3, and so on. The excess volume fluid from the last cell is flashed to standard 
conditions. When one batch calculation has been completed, a new batch of gas is injected into cell 
1 and the cell-to-cell calculation is continued until the injected gas volume at cell conditions equals 
1.2 times the volume of all cells. A 100% recovery of the “oil in place” is obtained if the sum of the 
volumes of stable oil from flashing the excess volume fluid from the last cell to standard conditions 
equals the volume obtained by flashing the original oil in the cells to standard conditions.
Figure 15.21 shows the recoveries found by a slim tube simulation on the oil composition in 
Table 3.47 characterized as shown in Table 15.2 for a temperature of 85.7°C with CO2 as injection 
gas and using the Peneloux corrected SRK equation. The slim tube was simulated using 2000 cells, 
and 10,000 time steps (gas injections) were used. The excess volume was moved from one cell to 
the next one using the moving excess criterion. As can be seen from Figure 15.21, the simulated 
MMP is of the order of 210 bar, which compares well with the experimental MMP of 208 bar (see 
Figure 3.25).
Cell-to-cell calculations by Zhao et al. (2006) confirm the development of constant composition 
zones as sketched in Figure 15.15.
Unlike the tie-line method, a cell-to-cell simulation does not provide an analytical solution for 
the MMP. It is, however, possible to configure a cell-to-cell simulator to detect whether a miscible

drive has developed or not. The fluid in the cell in which miscibility develops is at its critical point. 
The compositions of the two phases in equilibrium are identical and the K-factors of all components 
are equal to 1.0. The K-factor of a component is defined as the ratio of the mole fraction of the 
component in the vapor and liquid phases. The following criteria may be used to decide whether 
miscibility has developed:
lnK 1 i
i 1
N 2 ( ) < =
E (15.9)
T mixture T 5 K and P mixture P 5 bar c c ( )- - < ( ) < (15.10)
where T and P are the cell temperature and pressure. The term mixture is to be understood as an 
equal molar mixture of the oil and gas compositions in the cell. The mixture critical point (Tc,Pc) 
may be calculated as outlined by Michelsen and Heideman (1981).
Another indication that miscibility has developed is almost identical phase densities. With the oil 
composition in Table 15.2, the criterion for miscibility in Equations 15.9 and 15.10 says miscibility 
develops in cell 1641 in time step 6442. Figure 15.22 shows that the simulated phase densities in 
the tube for this time step become almost equal consistent with the fact that both phase composi￾tions are at their critical point. It is seen that there are zones of constant density consistent with the 
constant composition zones sketched in Figure 15.15.
Cell-to-cell simulations are quite time consuming but may possibly be speeded up by taking 
advantage of the fact that N-1 constant composition zones as sketched in Figure 15.15 develop in 
tubes or reservoirs with continuous gas injection. If the phase compositions are almost the same in 
two neighboring cells in the same time step or almost the same in a particular cell in two subsequent 
time steps, a K-factor flash calculation (Equations 6.22 through 6.24) will provide the correct flash 
result. Belkadi et al. (2011) have outlined a procedure for detecting when a K-factor flash calculation 
is sufficient and when a full flash is needed.

Formation Water and 
Hydrate Inhibitors
Oil and gas are often produced together with water coming from a zone beneath the hydrocarbon 
zones. The produced formation water will usually contain dissolved salts. The operator may further 
add methanol or glycol to suppress hydrate formation (Chapter 13). The miscibility between water 
and oil is quite limited, whereas the water content in gas and gas condensate mixtures can be quite 
significant. The solubility of hydrocarbons in the aqueous phase is usually small but can neverthe￾less be quite important. In the arctic and other environmentally sensitive regions, the hydrocarbon 
concentration in the water phase can, for example, decide the need for cleaning formation water 
before dumping it into the sea. When storing CO2 in aquifers, the solubility of CO2 in water, possibly 
with dissolved salts, influences how much CO2 can be stored.
Water, alcohols, and glycols deviate from hydrocarbons by having more polar forces acting between 
the molecules. Water has a molecular weight (M) of 18, which is close to that of methane (M = 16), but the 
absolute critical temperature of water is more than three times higher than that of methane, and the critical 
pressure is almost five times higher. This is because of attractive (association) forces acting between the 
water molecules, which make water behave as a substance of a somewhat higher molecular weight.
A cubic equation of state with classical a parameter mixing rule (Equation 4.33) is based on 
the assumption that the molecules are randomly distributed in each phase. This assumption does 
not hold for water dissolved in a hydrocarbon phase or hydrocarbons dissolved in a water phase. 
As is illustrated by Figure 16.1, there will be pockets in the hydrocarbon phase with a higher

water concentration than elsewhere, similarly there will be pockets in the water phase with a 
higher hydrocarbon concentration than in the water phase in general. GE (or activity coefficient) 
models such as UNIQUAC (Abrams and Prausnitz 1975) or UNIFAC (Fredenslund et al. 1977) 
can be used to represent the liquid phase of such systems. As opposed to a cubic equation of 
state with classical mixing rule, the GE models can represent liquid phases with local composi￾tions deviating from the overall (or macroscopic) composition. The classical GE models are, 
however, limited to liquids and fairly low pressures (≤10 bar). An optimum thermodynamic 
model would be a cubic equation of state extended or modified to also represent mixtures with 
polar compounds.
16.1 HYDROCARBON-WATER PHASE EQUILIBRIUM MODELS
The simplest way to handle mixtures of hydrocarbons and aqueous components would be to 
use either the SRK or the PR equation as presented in Chapter 4 (Equations 4.20 and 4.36, 
respectively). For this to be successful, the equation of state must be able to represent the 
phase behavior of pure water and of water mixed with hydrocarbons. Figure 16.2 shows the 
vapor pressure curve of pure water (ASME Steam Tables 1979). Also shown in Figure 16.2
are vapor pressure curves for water calculated using the SRK equation with the classical 
Soave temperature dependence for the a parameter (Equation 4.21) and using Mathias and 
Copeman (M & C) temperature dependence (Equations 4.27 and 4.28). Below 50°C, water 
vapor pressures simulated using the classical Soave temperature dependence are too low, 
whereas a very good match is seen with the M & C temperature dependence (almost indis￾tinguishable from that of ASME). This is further illuminated in Figure 16.3, which shows a 
close-up of the vapor pressure curves in Figure 16.2 for the temperature interval from 0 to 
50°C. The deviation in Figure 16.3 between the vapor pressures predicted using the classical 
Soave temperature dependence and using the M & C temperature dependence may not seem 
very alarming. However, in a situation in which liquid water is in contact with hydrocarbon

gas at a temperature between 0°C and 50°C at low pressure, the simulated concentration of 
water in the hydrocarbon gas will be approximately proportional with the simulated vapor 
pressure of water. At 4°C, the actual vapor pressure of water is about 50% higher than that 
predicted using the classical Soave temperature dependence. In phase equilibrium calcula￾tions on mixtures of water and natural gas, use of the classical Soave expression may lead to 
significant underpredictions of the amount of water contained in the gas. For higher tempera￾tures, satisfactory results are found using both the classical Soave temperature dependence 
and the M & C temperature dependence.
Table 16.1 shows typical binary interaction coefficients (kij) for water and hydrocarbon compo￾nent pairs. The interaction coefficients enter into the mixing rule for the equation of state a param￾eter as shown in Equations 4.33 and 4.35. Table 16.2 shows data for the mutual solubility of propane 
(C3) and water (H2O) at pressures ranging from 6.9 to 206.9 bar and temperatures of 369.6 and 394.3 
K (Kobayashi and Katz 1953). The solubility data is plotted in Figures 16.4 and 16.5. The dashed 
lines in the two figures show SRK simulation results for the solubility of C3 in H2O and the solubil￾ity of H2O in C3, respectively, using the C3–H2O interaction parameters in Table 16.1. The Mathias 
and Copeman expression (Equations 4.27 and 4.28) was used for the a parameter of water, and the 
classical Soave temperature dependence (Equation 4.21) was used for C3. The water concentration 
in the phase dominated by C3 is represented well using the SRK equation (Figure 16.5), whereas 
the C3 content in the water phase is simulated to be almost negligible and orders of magnitude 
lower than the experimental results (Figure 16.4). The two figures illustrate the fact that it is not 
possible with one kij to get a good match of the solubility of water in a hydrocarbon phase as well 
as the solubility of hydrocarbons in a water phase. The kijs in Table 16.1 have been determined to 
give a fairly good match of the water solubility in a hydrocarbon phase. This is at the expense of 
the solubility of hydrocarbons in water, which will be simulated to almost zero. Simulations essen￾tially neglecting the solubility of hydrocarbons in water can be satisfactory for many practical pur￾poses, but accurate solubility simulation results are important for some applications. Carbon dioxide 
(CO2) and benzene are examples of components with a fairly high solubility in water. The solubil￾ity of CO2 in water is important when assessing the CO2 storage capacity of an aquifer. Benzene 
is toxic, and there may be some environmental restrictions on the disposal of formation water

and 16.5, is an example of such a model and will be dealt with in the following section.440 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

16.1.1 Huron and Vidal Mixing Rule
At low pressure, the liquid phase(s) of partially miscible systems, for example, water–hydrocarbon 
mixtures, can be well-represented using an activity coefficient model (or GE model). The nonran￾dom, two-liquid (NRTL) model (Renon and Prausnitz 1968) is one example. It expresses the excess 
Gibbs energy as

The terms Gibbs free energy and activity coefficient are further explained in Appendix A. αji
is a non-randomness parameter that takes into account that the mole fraction of molecules of type 
i around a molecule of type j may deviate from the overall mole fraction of molecules of type Formation Water and Hydrate Inhibitors 441
i in the actual phase. The NRTL model is in other words able to represent phases in which the 
composition at a microscopic level deviates from the overall (or macroscopic) composition. As 
is illustrated in Figure 16.1, such deviations are seen for water dissolved in a hydrocarbon phase 
and for hydrocarbons contained in a water phase. The NRTL model is, therefore, also referred 
to as a local composition model. When αji in Equation 16.1 is zero, the mixture is completely 
random, and molecules of the same type will not cluster as shown in Figure 16.1. The parameter 
τ is defined by
t -
ji
ji ii g g
RT = (16.2)
where gji is an energy parameter characteristic of the j–i interaction. τji expresses the deviation 
between the energy interactions between a j and an i molecule and the energy interaction between 
two i molecules.

To apply the mixing rule in Equation 16.8 with the GE expression from Equation 16.5, the inter￾action parameters αji and (gji−gii) must be known for each binary pair contained in the mixture. 
Because hydrocarbon systems are generally satisfactorily described using the classical mixing Formation Water and Hydrate Inhibitors 443
rule for the a parameter, it would be desirable not to have to estimate any interaction parameters 
for hydrocarbon–hydrocarbon pairs. To accomplish this goal, Huron and Vidal (1979) suggested 
modifying NRTL equation in Equation 16.1 as follows, and to only use the GE expression at infinite 
pressure:

By comparing this expression with Equation 16.1, it is seen that Huron and Vidal have introduced 
the b parameter from the SRK equation in the expression for GE. This modification is practical 
because, it enables values of the parameters αji, gii, and gji to be determined that will give the same 
results with the H & V mixing rule as with the classical mixing rule. Huron and Vidal have shown 
that Equation 16.10 will reduce to (give the same results as) the classical mixing rule in Equation 
4.33 if the binary parameters are selected to

where kij is the binary interaction coefficient in the classical SRK mixing rule (Equations 4.33 and 
4.35). For an N component mixture there will be a total of 
N N x - ( ) 1
2 values of (gji–gji). If only one 
component (often H2O) in a mixture contributes to a non-random molecular order (α-value deviat￾ing from zero) then ( ) N N -1 2 ( ) -
2 of the interaction parameters can be determined from Equations 
16.11–16.13. The remaining (N-1) interaction parameters must be determined from experimental 
phase equilibrium data for the special component (e.g. H2O) and the remaining (N-1) components.
That Equation 16.8 really reduces to the classical SRK mixing rule with the interaction param￾eters in Equation 16.11–16.13 can be seen by initially inserting gii and gjj derived from Equation 
16.12 into Equation 16.13 to give

which is identical to the classical mixing rule in Equation 4.33.
The Huron and Vidal mixing rule is attractive for use on essentially nonpolar systems with 
some content of polar compounds. Specific Huron and Vidal interaction parameters are only 
needed for component pairs with polar compounds. For binaries of nonpolar compounds, the 
Huron and Vidal parameters can be found from Equations 16.11 through 16.13, which only 
make use of parameters of the classical SRK/PR mixing rules. The classical mixing rule is 
further used for binaries of an aqueous component and C7+. The solubility of C7+ in an aqueous 
phase is negligible and kijs can be applied, which will give a reasonable match of the solubility 
of aqueous components in C7+. The number of parameters to be estimated for the mixing rule 
of Huron and Vidal is lower than for other similar nonclassical mixing rules. With, for example, 
the MHV-2 model (Michelsen 1990) and the Wong and Sandler model (1992), binary interac￾tion parameters would have to be estimated for all pairs of non-identical components. The 
Huron and Vidal mixing rule has the further advantage that the calculation results are consis￾tent with those obtained with classical SRK mixing rules in the limit with no polar compounds 
present. Kristensen et al. (1993) used the SRK equation with the Huron and Vidal mixing rule 
on a gas condensate mixture to represent the distribution of methanol between a water phase, 
a hydrocarbon liquid phase, and a hydrocarbon gas phase. Water–methanol and water–hydro￾carbon pairs were represented using the classical SRK mixing rule. In a related work, Pedersen 
et al. (1996) further applied the mixing rule of Huron and Vidal to water–methanol and water–
hydrocarbon pairs.
Pedersen et al. (2001) have proposed a linear temperature dependence for the interaction param￾eters, gji and gij, where i is H2O and j one of the components N2, CO2, C1, C2, C3, or nC4:
g g (g g ) T(g g ) ij jj ij jj ij jj - - = ' ' + '' '' - (16.19)
g g (g g ) T(g g ) ji ii ij ii ji ii - = ' ' - - + '' '' (16.20)
T is the absolute temperature.
Recommended Huron and Vidal interaction parameters for mixtures with water and methanol 
can be seen in Tables 16.3 and 6.4, respectively (Pedersen et al. 2001). Boesen et al. (2017) have 
published H & V parameters MEG-CO2 and MEG-H2S.
Figures 16.4 and 16.5 show H & V simulation results for the mutual solubilities of C3 and H2O at 
the pressure and temperature conditions in Table 16.2.Formation Water and Hydrate Inhibitors 445

16.1.2 Huron and Vidal Mixing Rule Extended to Hydrocarbon-Salt
Water Systems
Formation water produced together with petroleum reservoir fluids will usually contain dissolved 
salts. These salts will somewhat affect the mutual solubility of hydrocarbons and water.
Sørensen et al. (2002) have proposed to use the SRK equation of state with Huron and Vidal mix￾ing rule for systems of hydrocarbons and salt water. The salts are treated as “ordinary” components 
with hypothetical critical properties. In the water phase, each salt molecule is assumed to split into 
as many “molecules” as the number of ions formed when the salt dissociates in aqueous solution. 
NaCl will, for example, split into a Na+ ion and a Cl− ion and be treated as two hypothetical mol￾ecules (one Na+ and one Cl−). The ions of the salts most common in formation water are assigned the 
properties in Table 16.5. These properties are close to those of triethylene glycol (TEG). TEG has

a similar effect on water as salts in terms of freezing point depression and lowering of gas solubil￾ity. Furthermore, TEG has a low volatility and low solubility in liquid hydrocarbons. To make sure 
the salts in phase equilibrium simulations stay out of the hydrocarbon phases, large fugacity coef￾ficients are assigned to the salt components in the gas and oil phases.
The presence of salts will lower the mole fraction of water in the water phase. How much the water 
concentration is lowered depends on the amount of salt and on the number of ions formed when the 
salt dissociates. As an example, NaCl will split into Na+ and Cl−, and the dilution effect of NaCl will 
be twice the number of undissociated NaCl molecules. CaCl2 is represented as three molecules. Each 
Ca2+ ion is further assumed to have six H2O molecules associated with it, which reduces the number of 
free H2O molecules. Imagine a system consisting initially of 100 moles H2O. Add one mole of CaCl2. 
According to the model of Sørensen et al. CaCl2 will associate with six moles of H2O and split into 
three moles of salt irrespective of temperature and pressure. The model sees 94 moles of free H2O and 
3 moles of salt. The Ca2+–H2O association is similar to the CaCl2 crystal–water bonds acting in the 
solid state. Figure 16.6 illustrates how NaC1 and CaCl2 are handled in aqueous solution.
Salt dissolved in a water phase will make the gas solubility in the water phase decrease. Pedersen 
and Milter (2004) have estimated both SRK and PR Huron and Vidal interaction parameters that 
account for this decrease. These parameters are listed in Table 16.6.
16.1.3 Cubic Plus Association
Aqueous compounds tend to self-associate (adhere to each other). This is the primary reason the 
phase behavior of mixtures with aqueous components is more difficult to model than the phase 
behavior of a hydrocarbon mixture. The critical point of water is at 647.3 K and 220.9 bar. Had no 
self-association taken place between the water molecules, the critical point of water would have 
been more like C1 (190.6 K and 46 bar). Kontogeorgis et al. (1996) have proposed to take the (imagi￾nary) properties of the single water molecules as the starting point and let the model account for 
the water–water self-association. The model approach is called cubic plus association (CPA). The 
association term enters as a correction to the pressure from a classical cubic equation
P P = + Cubic A P ssociation (16.21)
The cubic equation can be SRK (Equation 4.20) or any other cubic equation of state. The association 
term may be expressed as (Michelsen and Hendriks 2001)

Two associating components of different species may cross-associate and evaluation of Equation 
(16.23) requires a cross-association energy and a cross-association volume for each pair of cross￾associating components. The combining rules Voutsas et al. (1999), often referred to as CR-1, are 
commonly used

CO2 and H2S do not self-associate (ε A Bi i and β A Bi i are zero) but may cross-associate with water. They 
are said to be solvating with water and hydrate inhibitors. For those two components a modified

 is a parameter specific for each solvating component and water. Similar parameters exist for 
the two solvating components and other aqueous components. The concept of solvation is described 
by Folas et al. (2006).
Non-aqueous components, for example, C1 have no association sites and hence no values for nei￾ther self-association nor cross-association parameters. In turn they do not contribute to the associa￾tion term whether as pure components or as binaries with any other component.
An association scheme is required for each associating or solvating component. It tells the 
number of positive and negative association sites for each component. Table 16.7 shows CPA 
association schemes. An association scheme represents a certain way of interaction between posi￾tive and negative sites of a component. Figure 16.7 illustrates the association schemes 4C with 
two positively charged and two negatively charged association sites and 2B with one positively 
charged and one negatively charged association site defined in Table 16.6. All positively charged 
sites can associate with all negatively charged sites and vice versa. Sites of same charge, positive 
or negative, cannot associate with each other. This gives four association sites for the 4C associa￾tion scheme and two association sites for the 2B association scheme. To make use of the CPA 
model concept, five pure component parameters (a0, b, c1, εAB, and βAB) must be determined for 
each associating component. The parameter a0 is equivalent to ac in Equations 4.22 and 4.38, b 
is the b parameter entering into the cubic term, and c1 is equivalent to m in Equations 4.25, 4.40 
and 4.42. For a non-associating component, the association term is zero and there are no εAB and 
βAB parameters. The sour gases, CO2 and H2S, are assumed to solvate with water. For those two 
inorganic gases the parameters in the cubic term can be determined as for other non-associating 
components, but to properly account for the interaction with water, a cross-association volume 
βA Bi H2O
 must be determined.
A volume correction is generally not used for associating components, which means the c param￾eter in Equations 4.43 and 4.48 will be zero.
Unlike a classical cubic equation and the Huron–Vidal modification in Chapter 16.1.1, the 
CPA model is not bound to match the pure component critical point. The CPA parameters for 
an associating component can therefore not be determined from the critical temperature and 
pressure as is the case for a non-associating component. The CPA parameters are instead deter￾mined from property data. In general, too high critical temperatures and pressures are simulated 
for associating components using the CPA model. While the association concept holds true 
for low to moderate pressures, it is unable to correctly account for the molecular interactions Formation Water and Hydrate Inhibitors 451

at near-critical conditions. While the inability to match the critical point is a deficiency of the 
CPA model, it has other qualities. Lundstrøm et al. (2006) have shown that liquid isothermal 
compressibilities (defined in Equation 3.4) and sound velocities (defined in Equation 8.22) of 
pure water and methanol are better represented using the CPA model than the conventional SRK 
equation (Equation 4.20).452 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

Most published work on the CPA model has used SRK (Equation 4.20) as underlying cubic equa￾tion (e.g. Kontogeorgis et al. 2006a, 2006b). Sørensen et al. have shown that equally good simula￾tion results can be obtained using the cubic term from PR (Equation 4.36). CPA parameters for use 
with each of those two equations are shown in Tables 16.8–16.10.
Austegard et al. (2006) found that the Huron and Vidal model with interaction parameters 
linear in temperature described in mutual solubility of water and CO2 + CH4 gas slightly better 
than the CPA model. They considered data for temperatures up to 350°C and pressures up to 
3000 bar.Formation Water and Hydrate Inhibitors 453
16.2 EXPERIMENTAL HYDROCARBON-WATER PHASE 
EQUILIBRIUM DATA
Table 16.11 shows experimental phase equilibrium data for a gas condensate fluid mixed with water 
and methanol at a pressure of 75.8 bar and temperatures of 10°C and 50°C (Kristensen et al. 1993). 
The composition of the gas condensate is shown in Table 16.12. Also shown in Table 16.11 are simu￾lation results obtained by using SRK with the Huron and Vidal mixing rule.
Table 16.13 shows experimental phase equilibrium data for a reservoir oil composition mixed 
with water and methanol at pressures of 120 and 200 bar and temperatures around 7°C (Pedersen 
et al. 1996). The composition of the reservoir oil (Mixture 1) is shown in Table 16.14. Also shown 
in Table 16.13 are simulated results obtained using SRK with the Huron and Vidal mixing rule. 
Similar phase equilibrium data is shown in Table 16.15 for the gas condensate (Mixture 2), the 
composition of which is also given in Table 16.14.
Table 16.16 shows the composition of a gas condensate mixture. Its mutual solubility with pure 
water and salt water has been measured at high pressure and temperature. The phase equilibrium 
data can be seen in Table 16.17 and the saltwater (brine) composition from Table 16.18. Table 16.17
gives a good idea of the mutual solubility of water and hydrocarbons at elevated pressure and tem￾perature, as well as of the influence of dissolved salts on the gas solubility in water at reservoir 
conditions. Simulated results (Pedersen and Milter 2004) using the H & V model are shown in 
Table 16.19.
Table 16.20 shows experiment phase equilibrium data (Ng et al. 2001) for an acid gas mixed with 
water. Also shown are simulation results with SRK Huron and Vidal (H&V), PR H&V, SRK CPA, 
and PR CPA.
Other phase equilibrium data for petroleum reservoir fluids and water have been presented by 
Ng and Chen (1995) and by Kokal et al. (2003). The former study further covers phase equilibrium 
data for model systems of hydrocarbon, water, and methanol and of hydrocarbon, water, and mono 
ethylene glycol (MEG). Ng et al. (1993) have further presented phase equilibrium data for model 
systems of hydrocarbon, water, and tri ethylene glycol (TEG) for temperatures ranging from 25°C 
to 204°C and pressures up to 69 bar.

16.3 WATER PROPERTIES
The density of pure water may be calculated with good accuracy using the SRK or the PR equation 
of state with Peneloux volume correction (Equations 4.43 and 4.48). The latter correction can possi￾bly be made temperature dependent (Equation 5.9). Accurate results for derived properties for water 
such as the sound velocity (Equation 8.22) requires a model that is dedicated to water, for example, 
the model of Keyes et al. (1968).
A model that takes into consideration the attractive forces acting between the water molecules 
is also required to simulate the viscosity of water (e.g., Meyer et al. 1967; Schmidt 1969). The same 
applies for the thermal conductivity of water, for which property a model of Sengers and Keyes 
(1971) may be used.460 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

16.3.2 Thermal Conductivity of Water-Inhibitor Mixtures
Alcohols and glycols have lower thermal conductivities than water. A correct representation of 
the thermal conductivity of a hydrate inhibited water phase therefore requires a correlation that 
takes the content of inhibitor into account. The thermal conductivities of alcohols and glycols vary 
slightly with temperature and a linear correlation in temperature may be used for the thermal con￾ductivity (λL0) at atmospheric pressure
-L0 = + A BxT (16.36)
The constants A and B for commonly used hydrate inhibitors are shown in Table 16.25.
A pressure correction proposed by Missenard (1970) can be used for methanol and ethanol, while 
for glycols, the pressure dependence is modest and can be ignored.
The thermal conductivity of a mixture (mix) of water (H2O) and a hydrate inhibitor (inh) can be 
calculated from
ln w ln w ln ( ) - - mix H = O H ( ) O i + nh ( ) -inh 2 2

16.3.3 Properties of Salt Water

bar at three different temperatures and varying salt concentrations.
16.3.4 Oil–Water Emulsion Viscosities
In a production well or a pipeline transporting both oil and water, water-in-oil or oil-in-water emul￾sions may form. The viscosity of a water–oil emulsion may exceed the viscosities of the separate 
phases by several orders of magnitudes.
The maximum viscosity of the emulsion is seen at the water/oil ratio where the emulsion 
changes from a water-in-oil to an oil-in-water emulsion (inversion point). The following equation 
(Rønningsen 1995) may be used to predict the viscosity of a water-in-oil emulsion:

16.4 PHASE ENVELOPES OF HYDROCARBON-AQUEOUS MIXTURES
Lindeloff and Michelsen (2003) have outlined a procedure for calculating phase envelopes of mix￾tures of hydrocarbons and aqueous mixtures. Table 16.27 shows a gas condensate mixture (Fluid 
B in article of Lindeloff and Michelsen). This fluid was characterized for the PR equation of state. 
The simulated phase envelope is seen as a dashed line in Figure 16.9. Also shown in the same

mixed with an aqueous phase consisting of 71.4 mole percentage water and 28.6 mole percentage 
methanol. The mixing ratio was 1.49 mole reservoir fluid per mole aqueous phase. The Huron and 
Vidal mixing rule was used for component pairs consisting of a hydrocarbon gas constituent and 
either water or methanol. Four critical points were found for this mixture, as can be seen from 
Figure 16.10. Figures 16.9 and 16.10 illustrate that aqueous components can have a marked influ￾ence on the phase behavior of the hydrocarbon phases of petroleum reservoir fluids.

Scale Precipitation
Produced petroleum reservoir fluid well streams often carry formation water from an underlying 
water zone. The formation water may have a considerable content of salts, most of which are lightly 
soluble in water, for example, NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2. The water may further carry salts of low solu￾bility, such as BaSO4, CaCO3, and CaSO4, which under certain conditions can precipitate as solid 
salt. Salt deposition is often referred to as scaling, and is a potential problem in pipelines transport￾ing unprocessed well streams containing formation water. In the reservoir, scale precipitation can 
be seen when seawater is injected to obtain enhanced recovery and contacts formation water.
17.1 CRITERIA FOR SALT PRECIPITATION
A particular salt may precipitate if its solubility product, Ksp, is exceeded. The stoichiometric solu￾bility product of a salt is defined as the product of the molalities of the salt ions in a water solution 
saturated with salt. The stoichiometric solubility product of CaSO4 is, for example, defined as:
K ( sp 4 CaSO ) m m Ca SO4
= ++ -- (17.1)
where m stands for molality (mol/l). The thermodynamic solubility product Ksp
o of CaSO4 is defined 
as the product of the activities of Ca++ and SO4
− in a saturated solution in water:
K (CaSO ) a a sp
o
4 Ca SO4
= ++ -- (17.2)
where
a m a m Ca Ca Ca SO SO SO 4 4 ++ = = ++ ++ y y -- -- -- ; (17.3)
The term γ stands for activity coefficient and is defined in Equation A.34 in Appendix A. By 
combining Equations 17.1 and 17.3, it can be seen that the stoichiometric and thermodynamic solu￾bility products are related as follows (again exemplified through CaSO4):
K
K
sp
sp
o
Ca SO4
= y y ++ -- (17.4)
It can be seen from this equation that the stoichiometric and thermodynamic solubility products 
become equal if all activity coefficients are 1.0.
The salts that are most likely to precipitate from formation water are the following:
Calcium sulfate (CaSO4)
Barium sulfate (BaSO4)
Strontium sulfate (SrSO4)
Calcium carbonate (CaCO3)
Iron carbonate (FeCO3)
Iron sulfide (FeS)
Had O2 been present, iron would have precipitated as ferrihydroxide. The assumption here is that 
the formation water is free of O2. Whether a given salt will precipitate or not depends on a number 
17470 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
of factors. Obviously, the concentration of the ions making up the salt is important, but also the 
acidity (pH = −log10[H+]) where [H+] is the hydrogen ion concentration in mol/l), amounts of CO2
and H2S dissolved in the water phase and the concentration of other ions, for example, Na+, K+, and 
Cl−, will influence the scale potential. Whereas the molality is uniquely given by the concentration 
of salt ions, the activity coefficients are influenced by all the remaining factors.
The equilibria of interest are the following:

By comparing Equations 17.10 through 17.14 with Equation 17.2, it is seen that the equilibrium 
constants for CaSO4, BaSO4, SrSO4, FeCO3, and CaCO3 equal the thermodynamic solubility prod￾ucts of the same salts.
To summarize, precipitation of salts is determined by the following:
Molality of ions
Acidity
Equilibrium constants (some of which equal the thermodynamic solubility product of a salt 
that may precipitate)
Activity coefficients of all ions
17.2 EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTS
The temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant for the self-ionization of water (Equation 
17.5) may for the temperature, T, in K be described by (Olofsson and Hepler 1975):
-log K( ) (T) = + - +

The temperature dependence of the remaining equilibrium constants at a pressure of 1 bar may 
for the temperature in K be described as:
lnK (T) A B
T
C lnT D T E
T2 o = + + + + (17.17)
Values of the constants A to E are given in Table 17.1. The organic acid pool is often taken to 
be acetic acid, which is usually the main organic acid constituent. The alkalinity (AT) is defined as
A m T 2m m m m HCO C 3 3 O A OH H = +- -- - + + - + + (17.18)
The sum on the right-hand side of this equation is independent of pH.
This is a convenient definition because it keeps the alkalinity constant during pH changes. The 
pressure dependence of the equilibrium constants is given by:

d = lnK
P

The coefficients a, b, c, and d for each of the sulfate precipitation reactions are listed in Table 17.2.

(Equations 17.6 and 17.7) as:

where T is the temperature in K and ∂V/∂P is in cm3/(mol bar). For the calcium carbonate and fer￾rous carbonate precipitation reactions, Haarberg et al. (1990) have found that the compressibility 
changes are 0.015 cm3/(mol bar) independent of temperature.
For all reactions other than those explicitly mentioned in the preceding text, the effect of pressure 
on the equilibrium constants can be neglected.

The following is a convenient expression for the partial molar volume changes of the sulfate 
precipitation reactions (Haarberg 1989):

The activity coefficients may be calculated using the Pitzer model (Pitzer 1973, 1975, 1979, 1986; 
Pitzer et al. 1984). Pitzer expresses the activity of the water in terms of the osmotic coefficient ϕ as:

17.4 SOLUTION PROCEDURE
An initial evaluation of which salts are likely to precipitate can be made by calculating the satura￾tion ratio, SR. This quantity for CaSO4 is defined as follows:
SR(CaSO )
m m
K 4
Ca SO
sp
o
4 = ++ --
(17.49)
where the molalities are evaluated not considering precipitation. Salts having a solubility ratio 
higher than 1.0 are likely to precipitate, but the actual molality of the ions may be lower because 
one or both ions can possibly take part in another salt precipitating. A related quantity is the solubil￾ity index, SI, which for CaSO4 is defined as:
SI(CaSO ) log SR(CaSO ) log
m m
K 4 10 4 10
Ca SO
sp
o
4 = = (
(
|
|
)
)
|
|
++
( ) --
(17.50)
SI is greater than zero for salts likely to precipitate. If SI is negative, the salt will not precipitate. 
SR and SI are qualitative measures and insufficient when it comes to quantitative calculations of the 
amount of salt precipitate.
The amount of minerals that precipitate from an aqueous solution is evaluated by calcu￾lating the amount of ions in solution when equilibrium has established. The remaining salt 
content has precipitated. The thermodynamic equilibrium constants given from Equations 
17.10 through 17.15 must be fulfilled for salts precipitating, whereas this is not the case for 
salts that do not precipitate. For salts not precipitating, the product of the molalities and 
activity coefficients in Equations 17.10 through 17.15 will be less than the thermodynamic 
equilibrium constant.
Solving the system of equations is an iterative process. The activity coefficients are initially set 
equal to 1.0 for all ions. The equilibrium constants at 1 bar are calculated by use of Equations 17.16 
and 17.17, where the following iterative procedure is followed:
1. The equilibrium constants are corrected for pressure using Equation 17.21.
2. The stoichiometric equilibrium constants are calculated from the thermodynamic ones 
(Equation 17.4) and from the activity coefficients (equal to 1.0 in first iteration).482 Phase Behavior of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids
3. The concentration ratio of CO2(aq) to H2S(aq) is calculated. The concentrations of CO2(aq) 
and H2S(aq) are fixed (determined by the fugacities of CO2 to H2S in the hydrocarbon 
phase(s) in equilibrium with the water phase).
4. The amount of sulfate precipitation is calculated, with none of the other precipitation reac￾tions taken into account.
5. The ion products of the iron minerals (FeCO3 and FeS) are checked against the solubility 
products. Only one of the two iron minerals can precipitate because, for a fixed relative 
concentration of CO2(aq) to H2S(aq), the solubility products will not be fulfilled for both 
salts at the same time.
6. The ion product of calcium carbonate is checked against its solubility product. If the solu￾bility product is not exceeded, go to step 8. Otherwise continue with step 7.
7. A double-loop iteration is applied to calculate simultaneous precipitation of calcium car￾bonate and iron minerals. The inner loop calculates the amount of CaCO3 precipitation. 
This precipitation will affect the amount of sulfate precipitate because some Ca++ is 
removed from the solution. The amount of sulfate precipitate is corrected in each inner￾loop iteration. In the outer loop, the iteration variable is the amount of ferrous iron mineral 
precipitate. Convergence is achieved when the ion product of the ferrous mineral matches 
the thermodynamic solubility product.
8. The activity coefficients are (re)calculated from Pitzer’s activity coefficient model.
9. The procedure is then repeated from step 1 until convergence.
17.5 EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS
Table 17.7 shows two water analyses, one for formation water and another one for seawater. Figure 17.1
shows the amount of scale precipitate at a temperature of 80°C and 135 bar as a function of mixing 
ratio. The water is assumed to be in equilibrium with a gas containing 4.8 mol% CO2 and no H2S. 
BaSO4 and SrSO4 are seen to precipitate.

Similar plots are shown in Figures 17.2 and 17.3 for the combination of formation water and sea￾water shown in Table 17.8. When the water is in equilibrium with a gas containing CO2 and no H2S 
(Figure 17.2), the iron mineral precipitating is FeCO3. If the water contains H2S in addition to CO2, 
iron precipitates as FeS (Figure 17.3).
BaSO4 has a low solubility in water and the solubility decreases with decreasing pressure. If a 
water phase is saturated with BaSO4 at high pressure, solid BaSO4 is likely to precipitate at lower 
pressure. Table 17.9 shows solubility data for BaSO4 in pure water (Bloust 1977). The data is plotted 
in Figure 17.4 with simulation results using the models presented in this chapter.

Appendix A: Fundamentals 
on Phase Equilibrium
This appendix gives an introduction to the fundamental thermodynamic relations that determine 
the equilibrium state of a multicomponent mixture.
A.1 FIRST AND SECOND LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS
The first law of thermodynamics is the law of energy conservation, stating that the change in the 
total energy of a system, dUt
, equals the sum of the heat, dQ, supplied to the system, and the work, 
dW, done on the system by the surroundings:
dU dQ dW dQ pdV t t =+ =- (A.1)
The superscript t means total. Equation A.1 further states that the work done on the system by 
the surroundings equals the pressure times the volume decrease.
Before presenting the second law, it is necessary to first introduce the thermodynamic quantity 
entropy (S). The change in the total entropy of a system is defined as follows:
dS dQ
T
t rev = (A.2)
T stands for temperature and the subscript rev for reversible. The heat dQ is transferred reversibly 
to the system if the system and the surroundings always are in thermal and mechanical equilibrium 
during the transfer of heat. In general, it applies that
dS dQ
T
t ≥ (A.3)
which is the second law of thermodynamics.
A.2 FUNDAMENTAL THERMODYNAMIC RELATIONS
Combining Equations A.1 and A.3 gives
dU + P dV T dS t t t ≤ (A.4)
In phase equilibrium calculations, it is convenient to work with Gibbs free energy, G, 
defined by
G H TS t t t = - (A.5)
Ht
 is the total enthalpy of the system defined by
H U PV t t t = + (A.6)
G U PV TS t t t t = + – (A.7)488 Appendix: A Fundamentals on Phase Equilibrium
Differentiation of this equation gives
dG dU P dV V dP T dS S dT t t t t t t = + + – – (A.8)
Equations A.4 and A.8 may be combined to give
dG V dP S dT t t t ≤ – (A.9)
For processes carried out at constant P and T, it will therefore apply that
dG 0 t
P,T ( ) < (A.10)
For a system only undergoing reversible (equilibrium) processes, Gibbs free energy will remain 
unchanged. Any irreversible processes occurring at constant P and T will cause a decrease in the 
Gibbs energy of the system.
This leads to the following definition of the equilibrium state:
The equilibrium state of a closed system at a given P and T is the one for which the Gibbs free energy 
of the system is at a minimum with respect to all possible changes.
One may ask what changes a closed system is likely to undergo at fixed P and T. Not considering 
chemical reactions, the system may form one homogeneous phase, or it may separate into two or 
more unlike phases. The latter will be the case if the system can lower its Gibbs free energy through 
a phase split as compared to G of the single-phase state.
A.3 PHASE EQUILIBRIUM
Consider a closed cell containing a vapor phase (V) and a liquid phase (L). The two phases can be 
regarded as two open systems, where mass may be transferred from one system to the other one.
Besides being a function of P and T, the Gibbs free energy is a function of the number of moles 
of each component ni
 in the phase:
G f P, T, n , , n = ... ( ) 1 N (A.11)
where N is the total number of components.
Differentiation gives for the change in the total Gibbs free energy of a system:

This equation states that the chemical potential of any component i, at a fixed P and T, must be 
the same in two phases in equilibrium. This criterion may be extended to three or more phases in 
equilibrium.
A.4 FUGACITIES AND FUGACITY COEFFICIENTS
In phase equilibrium calculations, it is practical to work with the term fugacity rather than chemical 
potential. The fugacity f is defined through the following equation:
dG = RT d ln f (A.23)
where G is the molar Gibbs free energy and R the gas constant. Equation A.9 applied on a closed 
system in equilibrium and containing one mole gives
dG V dP S dT = – (A.24)
For T constant, this expression may be reduced to
dG V dP T ( ) = (A.25)490 Appendix: A Fundamentals on Phase Equilibrium
which, by combining Equations A.23 and A.25, may be used to derive the following pressure depen￾dence of the fugacity:

where Pref is a reference pressure.
For liquid (L) and solid (S) phases, it is reasonable to assume that the molar volume V is indepen￾dent of pressure, in which case the pressure dependence of the fugacity becomes

For an ideal gas, Equation A.25 can be written as

dP RTd P T ( ) = = ln (A.29)
Equation A.29 is not generally valid, but it is practical to work with an equally simple relation 
for real systems. Such a relation is obtained through the definition of the fugacity in Equation A.23. 
For component i in a mixture, the fugacity is defined through
d RT d ln f ui i = (A.30)
which may be integrated to give
u u i i
o RT i = + ln f (A.31)
The reference chemical potential µi
o is a function of T. As the two phases in equilibrium are at 
the same temperature and pressure, Equations A.22 and A.31 may be combined to give the follow￾ing equilibrium relation:

The vapor and liquid phase fugacity coefficients of component i, ϕi
V and ϕi
L , are defined through 
the following relations:
f y i P; f x P V
i i

L
i i
L = = p p (A.33)
In these equations, yi
 is the mole fraction of component i in the vapor phase and xi
 the mole frac￾tion of component i in the liquid phase. An alternative way of expressing the fugacity of component 
i in the liquid phase would be to relate it to the fugacity of pure i, fi
o , at the same temperature and 
pressure:
f x f i
L
i i i
o = y (A.34)
where gi
 is the activity coefficient of component i. The pure component fugacity (fi
o
) is often 
approximated as the pure component vapor pressure (P ). i
satAppendix: A Fundamentals on Phase Equilibrium 491
The ratio between the vapor- and liquid-phase mole fractions is called the equilibrium ratio or 
the K-factor:
K y
x i

i
= (A.35)
From Equations A.32, A.33, and A.35, it is seen that the equilibrium relation can be expressed 
in terms of the K-factor:

To derive an expression, which makes it possible to calculate the fugacity coefficient of a com￾ponent in a mixture from an equation of state, the term partial molar property is introduced. This 
term is related to one particular component of a mixture. If this component is called i, a partial 
molar property of component i is defined as the derivative of that particular property (e.g., G, S, or 
V) with respect to the mole number of component i at constant temperature and pressure. It is seen 
from Equation A.13 that the chemical potential equals the partial molar Gibbs free energy:
ui i - G (A.37)
Differentiation of Equation A.24 with respect to mole number leads to the following relation 
between the partial molar properties of G, V, and S:
dGi i = - V dP Si dT (A.38)
For T constant, this relation reduces to
dG V dP; T constant i i = (A.39)
Recalling that the partial molar G equals the chemical potential, it is possible to combine 
Equations A.23 and A.39 to
V dP RT dln f i i = (A.40)
For an ideal gas, the partial molar volume equals the pure component molar volume
V V RT
P i i = = (A.41)
and the fugacity of the component equals its partial pressure:
f y i i = P (A.42)
where yi
 is the mole fraction component i. This gives the following relation for an ideal gas:

dP = RT d y ln( ) i
