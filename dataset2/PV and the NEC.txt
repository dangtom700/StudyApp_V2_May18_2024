PV and the NEC
PV and the NEC presents a straightforward explanation of the 
National Electrical Code (NEC) in everyday language.
Used throughout the United States and many other coun￾tries, the NEC is the world’s most detailed set of electrical 
codes pertaining to photovoltaic (PV) systems. This new edition 
is based on the 2023 NEC, with most of the interpretations 
and material staying true long after. It interprets the distinct 
differences between previous versions of the NEC and the 2023 
NEC and clarifies how these code changes relate specifically to 
PV installations. It includes Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and 
EV to Grid (EV2G).
Written by two of the leading authorities and educators in the 
field, this book will be a vital resource for solar professionals, as 
well as anyone preparing for a solar certification exam.

Introduction
Inverter noise on an oscilloscope is on the cover of the 2023 NEC!
At least we think that may be the case, or could it be what a 
lithium-ion sees when crossing over. We are sure that it must be 
renewable energy related since we have confidence in our significance.
Photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage systems (ESS), including 
the types with wheels, are growing fast. Similarly, the PV and ESS 
material in the National Electrical Code (NEC) is changing faster 
than anything the NEC has seen since the days of Thomas Edison 
and Nikola Tesla hashing it out over dc vs. ac. It appeared that 
Tesla was right when 2-phase ac power1
 was installed at Niagara 
Falls: ac was the way of the future, but the future is always unpre￾dictable, and with PV and energy storage, dc is making a comeback.
This book is designed to relay to the layperson working in the 
PV industry the NEC PV-related material and changes as simply 
as possible. We hope that professional engineers (PEs) and sun￾burnt solar installers alike will be able to comprehend its writing 
style and be entertained just enough to not be bored learning 
about a Code that has been known to work better than melatonin 
on a redeye flight.
We consider ESS to be under the domain of this book, since 
Article 706 ESS was birthed from Article 690 PV Systems in the 
2017 edition of the NEC.
Since this book is mostly about PV, rather than starting at the 
beginning of the NEC, we will start with the most relevant article 
of the NEC, which is Article 690 Photovoltaic (PV) Systems; 
we will then cover the new Article 691 Large-Scale Photovoltaic 
(PV) Electric Supply Stations, which modifies Article 690 for large 
PV systems, and then dive into the interconnections of Article 705 2 Introduction
Interconnected Electric Power Production Sources, which shows 
how PV and other power sources can connect to and feed other 
power sources such as the utility grid. The next articles we will 
cover are those on energy storage: the newer and relevant Article 
706 Energy Storage Systems; and the older and less relevant 
Article 480 Stationary Standby Batteries. While we are on the sub￾ject of energy storage, we will cover Article 625 EV Power Transfer 
Stations (charging and discharging of EVs) and Article 710 Stand￾Alone Systems (which was formerly 690.10). Articles 706 and 710 
were first brought into the NEC in 2017. We will then go back 
to the beginning of the NEC and look at Chapters 1 through 4, 
which apply to all wiring systems, including PV. We will see that, 
in covering the new and renewable PV-centric articles, we already 
covered the more important parts of Chapters 1 through 4 used 
for PV systems and all electric installations, such as Article 250 
Grounding and Bonding, and Article 310 for wire sizing. There 
will be many times when we are covering material in Article 690 
where we will go back and forth to other articles, since this is the 
way to properly use the NEC. We will also cover relevant parts of 
Figure 0.1 1895 Niagara Falls power plant.

Transformer_House#/media/File:Westinghouse_Generators_at_Niagara_Falls.jpgIntroduction 3
Chapter 9 Tables and a bit about how to use the Informational 
Annexes.
Interestingly, all the “.2” definitions in the NEC, such as 690.2, 
705.2 and 706.2 definitions, have been moved to Article 100 where 
all definitions in the Code are now located. We have some of the 
more important and difficult to explain definitions at the begin￾ning of Chapter 11 on page 263. We also included some industry￾relevant abbreviations and acronyms which you may refer to in 
your journey throughout this book. This book is 51% more likely 
to be skipped around in rather than read through beginning to end.
The NEC is updated every three years with a new Code cycle. 
This edition of PV and the NEC reflects the 2023 NEC and will 
discuss earlier versions of the NEC. When the 2026 NEC comes 
out, this material will not be obsolete; in fact, around half the PV 
in the United States is installed in places that adopt the NEC three 
years after a Code is released. For instance, the state with most 
of the solar in the US is California, and in California, the 2020 
NEC was adopted in 2023 and will be used until the 2023 NEC is 
adopted in 2026. It is also interesting to note that the proposals for 
changes to the NEC are crafted three years earlier, so the material 
in the 2020 NEC was proposed in 2017 and will be used on a 
regular basis by installers and inspectors up to nine years later. 
Since the equipment changes so fast in the PV industry, the Code 
writers intentionally leave parts of the Code open-ended to make 
way for new inventions that you may come up with, which will save 
lives and may make you rich. We even have places like NYC and 
Indiana where the NEC is adopted over a decade after it comes 
out. To see a variety of different sources for when and where the 
NEC is adopted, you need look no further than Sean’s website at 
www.solarsean.com/nec-adoption-lists-and-maps.
The 2023 NEC proposals for Article 690 and for other solar￾relevant parts of the Code were first proposed at meetings in 2020 
and put in a Word document by Bill Brooks. This Word document 
grew, and the proposals were refined with a lot of input. These 
future Codes were later proposed to the top dogs at the National 
Fire Protection Association by Ward Bower and Bill Brooks of 
NEC Code Making Panel 4 in Hilton Head, North Carolina. 
Ward Bower, our hero and nice guy, invented the grid-tied inverter 
in 1977 at Sandia Labs and is an endorser on the back cover of 
this book.4 Introduction
Now is the time to take out your 2023 NEC and follow along to 
understand PV and the NEC. We have heard of people buying this 
book instead of the NEC and having inspectors pass them based 
on the interpretations herein. See if you can get your state to adopt 
PV and the NEC, rather than the NEC.
Here are some different places where you can find the NEC:
1. National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) website free 
and paid electronic versions, which can only be accessed when 
you are online. Hard copy versions are also available on the 
NFPA website. We were able to pay for a PDF version of the 
NEC until the 2020 NEC was published, at which time NFPA 
stopped offering the PDF, which was unfortunate for those of 
us who like to work offline.
• www.NFPA.org/70
2. Online and brick bookstores such as Amazon or any builder’s 
bookstore.
3. Online places where NEC access is granted after it is adopted. 
Once the NEC is adopted, it becomes law and it is our 
understanding that once something is law it can be shared 
freely.
• www.up.codes
4. Some building departments, such as the one in the authority 
having jurisdiction (AHJ) of Tool, Texas, which you can find 
with a search.
• www.archive.org
We are sure that NFPA does not like you getting the information 
in other places, and we are recommending using the NFPA website 
to get your copy, so we can stay on their good side.
If you are buying a copy which you want to use for a NABCEP 
exam, you should find out which version NABCEP will be using at 
the time of your exam and be sure to purchase the NEC Codebook, 
and do not use tabs or any handwriting except for a highlighter. 
The NEC Handbook has more details, explanations, and pretty￾colored drawings, but is not allowed on NABCEP exams. If you 
are taking an electrician’s exam, check with your state licensing 
board to see the requirements, and good luck on passing!
We strive for perfection, but just in case, we have textbook 
corrections at www.solarsean.com/textbook-corrections.Introduction 5
This book is dedicated to your local building inspector.
Thanks for joining Bill and Sean’s excellent adventure. Read on 
and be excellent to each other!
Note
1 The first power plant at Niagara Falls had two phases that were 90° 
out of phase with each other (weird) (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Two-phase_electric_power). Now we use single (split), or three phases 
that are 120° out of phase with each other. This is interesting!DOI: 10.4324/9781003189862-2
1 Article 690 Photovoltaic (PV) 
Systems Overview and 690 
Part I General
Article 690 first came out in a little book known as the 1984 NEC 
and has been updated and mostly lengthened ever since. However, 
with the 2014 and 2017 versions, new articles were made with 
material from 690, which shortened 690. Taken out of 690 were 
705 Interconnected Power Production Sources in the 2014 NEC, 
and then in the 2020 NEC we separated out 706 Energy Storage 
Systems, 710 Stand-Alone Systems, and 712 DC Microgrids. In 
the 2023 NEC, DC microgrids was combined with AC microgrids 
in 705.
In comparing the original 1984 version of Article 690 to today’s 
NEC, there are many similarities, yet also quite a few differences. 
Time to dig in!
Let us first list what we are dealing with in Article 690 before we 
dig deep. This will give us perspective and familiarize us with how 
to look things up quickly.
The NEC, also known as NFPA 70, is divided into Chapters, 
then Articles, and then Parts and Sections.
For example, rapid shutdown requirements are found in:
NEC Chapter 6 Special Equipment
Article 690 Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Systems
Part II Circuit Requirements

Now it is time to dive into the detail of Article 690.
Article 690 Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Systems Part I General 
(part)
690.1 Scope (section 690.1)
Word-for-word NEC:
690.1 Scope. This article applies to solar PV systems, other 
than those covered by Article 691, including the array circuit(s), 
inverter(s), and controller(s) for such systems. The systems 
covered by this article include those interactive with other elec￾tric power production sources or stand-alone, or both. These 
PV systems may have ac or dc output for utilization.
Big image changes! The images at the beginning of Article 690 
that we have seen over and over for a long time have changed. The 
images with ac and dc coupled systems were moved to the begin￾ning of Article 705, with different terminology explained later in 
this book. Then the new images, which were drawn by the artist 
known as Bill Brooks in Informational Note No. 1 / Informational 
Note Figure 690.1, cover some very noticeable terminology 
changes as we see here in Figure 1.2 of this book on the following 
page.
2023 NEC 690.1 Informational Note No. 2 is self-explanatory 
and was called Informational Note No. 1 in the 2020 NEC: “Article 
691 covers the installation of large-scale PV electric supply 
stations.”
Article 691 Large-Scale PV Electric Supply Stations was 
introduced in the 2020 NEC and covers PV projects over 5MW 
output.
Discussion: Before the 2023 NEC we called circuits directly 
connected to solar cells (wild PV) “PV source circuits” before 
they were connected in parallel in a dc combiner (a.k.a. combiner 
box), and “PV output circuits” after they exited the dc combiner. 
The 2023 NEC changes this terminology and calls the circuits 
entering the dc combiner either a PV source circuit or a PV string 
circuit.10 690 PV Systems Overview and 690 Part I
Summary of PV circuit names
Before entering a dc combiner:
2023 NEC: PV string circuit or PV source circuit
2020 NEC and earlier: PV source circuit
Figure 1.2 2023 NEC Informational Note Figure 690.1 by Bill Brooks, 
NEC Code Making Panel 4.690 PV Systems Overview and 690 Part I 11
After exiting a dc combiner:
2023 NEC: PV source circuit
2020 NEC and earlier: PV output circuit
String Theory
We can now call a PV source circuit a “string.” The term 
string has been in the IEC (International Electrotechnical 
Commission) and many other international codes and 
standards since the beginning of solar time. Since everyone 
in the industry is calling PV source circuits “strings,” would 
Figure 1.3 2020 NEC Informational Note Figure 690.1(a) identification 
of PV power source components for comparison of changes.
Courtesy NFPA.12 690 PV Systems Overview and 690 Part I
it be acceptable to call a dc-to-dc converter source circuit a 
“string”? Perhaps, if you are into stringing together slang.
On another note, we often hear installers calling 
microinverters that are connected in parallel a “string.” We 
need to correct the microinverter “string” concept by calling 
it a “branch” rather than a “string,” since microinverters 
connected together are generally connected in parallel, like 
a branch circuit, and do not have that “series-string thing” 
happening.
There is microinverter technology that consists of lower￾voltage microinverters connected in series with other 
microinverters so that the voltages add, but it is not currently 
on the market.
There are some rather dramatic looking changes, which really 
do not change what we do, but since they are with the images we 
first see when we go to Article 690, they stand out. Most notice￾ably, we see PV string circuits, which was something every dili￾gent solar instructor would tell you not to say and was a slang 
word, just like solar panel is now. Essentially what we are doing 
is getting rid of the term PV output circuit then calling both PV 
source circuits and the old PV output circuits PV source circuits. 
We are calling what was formerly only called a PV source circuit a 
PV string circuit. We will go over this a few ways, so you can put it 
in your long-term memory.
Wild PV!
When solar cells are in a circuit with no electronics, such as 
dc-to-dc converters or inverters taming the PV, we can call it 
“wild PV” according to Wild Bill Brooks. This wild name￾calling is to indicate that the PV source circuits can have 
currents and voltages, determined by the climate. We can 
have voltages and currents that are greater than PV module 
STC (Standard Test Conditions), so for instance, we can 
have irradiance over 1000W per square meter, which means 690 PV Systems Overview and 690 Part I 13
that the current we calculate in 690.8(A) is based on short 
circuit current multiplied by a correction factor of 125%. 
Additionally, the voltage for wild PV is calculated in 690.7 
and is greater in colder places. Once electronics get involved 
and have the ability to limit the currents and voltages, we 
no longer have wild PV and the extra correction factors 
associated with it, and then we can potentially carry more 
power on a conductor, among other things.
One more thing we see in the 2023 NEC Informational Note 
Figure 690.1 when we compare it to the 2020 NEC, is that previ￾ously we had dc-to-dc converter source circuits and dc-to-dc con￾verter output circuits, where the source circuits went into the dc 
combiner and the output circuits came out of the dc combiner 
after the parallel connections. Using a dc-to-dc converter dc com￾biner is typical of larger commercial products. Now, as of the 2023 
NEC, we call what was formerly a dc-to-dc converter source cir￾cuit and a dc-to-dc converter output circuit a dc-to-dc converter 
circuit. We have essentially got rid of calling things output circuits 
inside the PV system in Article 690 of the 2023 NEC. Everything is 
now a source. However, on the output of a PV system, it is possible 
to have a PV system output circuit. This is for consistency with 
other source output circuits such as wind system output circuit or 
fuel cell system output circuit.
To sum it up all dc PV circuits, can be called PV source circuits 
and when a PV circuit is made up of modules in series, it can also 
be called a PV string circuit. All dc-to-dc converter circuits are 
now called dc-to-dc converter circuits.
Central Inverters, String Inverters, and Microinverters
These terms are not defined in the NEC but are commonly 
used in the industry.
A microinverter is usually an inverter connected directly 
to one or more PV modules, which is placed under the PV 
modules. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has provisions 14 690 PV Systems Overview and 690 Part I
for manufacturing incentives where a microinverter is defined 
as a single PV module per inverter. One rather popular brand 
of “microinverters” has 4 PV modules per inverter. There 
may be a renaissance of multiple PV modules in series per 
microinverter or dc-to-dc converter with the UL 3741 PV 
Hazard Control System (PVHCS) listing for rapid shutdown 
(see 690.12).
A string inverter is the term used for an inverter that has 
PV string circuits that go straight to the inverter, so no dc 
combiners are used. There are some huge gigawatt-scale PV 
projects that use string inverters.
Central inverters are large inverters where you have dc 
combiners in the field, combining PV string circuits, and 
then out of the combiners come PV source circuits (formerly 
known as PV output circuits), which go to the inverter.
In the previous versions of this book and the NEC there were 
more images of PV systems and components, which were moved 
to article 705, which is covered in Chapter 9. You may recall the 
images with ac-coupled and dc-coupled systems.

690.4(F) Electronic Power Converters in Not Readily Accessible 
Locations
One of the more difficult things for someone learning to use the 
NEC is to remember to know where to look for something. This 
book is going to do its best to outline, organize, point to, and dis￾cuss topics, so that the reader will be more familiar with and have 
a better idea of where to find what they are looking for.690 PV Systems Overview and 690 Part I 15
Section 690.4 General Requirements, which is in Part I General 
of Article 690, is not very memorable, and it is going to stump a 
few people who are looking for this information, so let us state 
the obvious and dive into these General Requirements. If you can 
make something catch your attention for whatever reason, it will 
help you remember it.
690.4(A) Photovoltaic Systems
In plain English: PV systems can supply a building at the same 
time as other sources of power.
Discussion: If you live in coal country and the AHJ refuses to 
let you put those fresh sunbeam electrons into the grid, you can 
support your argument here. North Dakota is the worst state for 
solar by the way. Ranked 52 out of 50 states.
690.4(B) Equipment
Equipment that needs to be listed (or field labeled) for PV 
applications according to 690.4(B):
Electronic Power Converters (Includes inverters and dc-to-dc 
converters)
Inverters (UL 1741) (UL 1741SA in California)
Motor Generators (Dc motors driving a rotating generator.)
PV Modules (UL 1703 old or UL 61730 newer)
PV Panels (Products have been built that panelize modules and 
have been listed when shipped that way. Solyndra solar panels 
were a group of tubes, each being a module, which were listed 
and shipped with multiple tubes on a rack creating a solar panel 
and listed to UL 1703.)
Ac Modules (UL 1703 or UL 61730 and UL 1741 tested as a unit.)
Dc Combiners (UL 1741)
Dc-to-Dc Converters (UL 1741)
Charge Controllers (UL 1741)
PV Rapid Shutdown Equipment (PVRSE) (UL 1741)
PV Hazard Control Equipment or System (PVHCE or PVHCS) 
(UL 3741)
Dc Circuit Controllers (UL 1741)16 690 PV Systems Overview and 690 Part I
Discussion of listed and field labeled equipment: Listed 
products are found on a list of certified products that 
various certification labs develop. Field labeled products 
may not be on one of these lists but get evaluated by a 
certification lab which puts a label on the product after 
it has met whatever test requirement was requested to be 
tested. For example, say that your 5MW inverter was not 
listed to UL 1741 and was made in Europe. A testing lab 
can come out and test and field label the inverter to certify 
that it is compliant with the project specifications. This can 
be expensive and most often avoided by using equipment 
listed to UL 1741.
690.4(C) Qualified Personnel
What it means: Installation of equipment and wiring should be 
done by “qualified personnel.”
There is an informational note that tells us that we can look to 
Article 100 Definitions to see the definition of qualified person. 
Article 100 Qualified Person Definition: One who has skills and 
knowledge related to the construction and operation of the elec￾trical equipment and installations and has received safety training 
to recognize and avoid the hazards involved.
Discussion: Some would say that a qualified solar installer 
is NABCEP PV Installation Professional (PVIP) Certified. 
Others would say only an electrician should install solar and 
yet others say only a roofer should put a hole in a roof, or only 
a pile driver should put a pile in the ground. There is also a UL 
Solar Certification. Where are all the UL Certified Installers? 
(There is one of the few writing this book.) Perhaps reading 
this book and taking our classes makes you qualified or is at 
least part of the process. You are more qualified than you were 
two pages ago. Perhaps this “qualified” definition is purposely 
vague, like many things in the NEC, so that different AHJs can 
have different interpretations to fit their environmental and pol￾itical climates.690 PV Systems Overview and 690 Part I 17
An Informational Note on Informational Notes
Informational notes in the NEC are good ideas, but not 
requirements. Just like a yellow speed sign tells you it is a 
good idea to slow down for a corner, an informational note 
gives you good advice. Informational notes used to be called 
fine print notes and abbreviated FPN. If you read the NEC 
Handbook, rather than the Codebook, there is more com￾mentary in the Handbook, which is not part of the Code, but 
tries to help. Sometimes the commentary disagrees with the 
Code, which is ironic.
690.4(D) Multiple PV Systems
What it means: multiple PV systems are allowed on a single 
building.
If multiple PV systems on a building are located away from 
each other, then there must be a directory at each PV system 
disconnecting means showing where the other disconnecting 
means are located in accordance with 705.10 Directory.
Discussion: We do not want firefighters thinking they turned off 
all the PV on the building when they hit one of the disconnects on 
the building, not knowing that there are other disconnects that will 
turn off other PV systems at different locations on the building. 
Tricking firefighters or utility workers is not cool nor is it allowed.
Disconnecting Means Means …
As you would like to think, a PV system disconnecting means 
is an off switch for a PV system. A disconnecting means is 
what separates a PV system from the rest of the electrical 
system. A PV system disconnecting means for an interactive 
(grid-tied) inverter would be on the ac side of the inverter, 
separating the PV system from what is not the PV system.
We generally have one PV system disconnecting means 
and several equipment disconnects for a PV system. Some 18 690 PV Systems Overview and 690 Part I
rare and complicated dc PV systems could have more than 
one disconnect to form the PV system disconnecting means, 
but these disconnects have to be grouped for each system.
Study PV System and Source Disconnects in Figures 9.1 
and 9.2 in the Article 705 images in Chapter 9 on pages 190 
and 191 of this book. These images were formerly in Article 
690 in earlier versions of the NEC.
690.4(E) Locations Not Permitted
PV equipment and disconnecting means are not allowed in 
bathrooms, just in case you had your heart set on mounting one 
next to your toilet—sorry, not allowed. Put that TP roll somewhere 
else than the handle of the dc disconnect. 
Think of “wet feet” and getting shocked.
690.4(F) Electronic Power Converters Mounted in Not Readily Accessible 
Locations
Electronic power converters (inverters, dc-to-dc converters, etc.) can 
be on roofs or other exterior areas that are not readily accessible. 
This clearly tells us among other things, that there is no problem 
putting module level power electronics (MLPE) underneath PV 
modules.
690.4(G) PV Equipment Floating on Bodies of Water (New and as 
exciting as a boat trip!)
Here is the exact and easily understandable wording:
PV equipment floating on or attached to structures floating 
on bodies of water shall be identified as being suitable for the 
purpose and shall utilize wiring methods that allow for any 
expected movement of the equipment.
Informational Note:
PV equipment in these installations is often subject to increased 
levels of humidity, corrosion, and mechanical and structural 690 PV Systems Overview and 690 Part I 19
stresses. Expected movement of floating PV arrays is often 
included in the structural design.
Discussion: There was an effort to create a required UL listing 
for floating equipment, but no standard has been written yet, so it 
is not in the NEC. Identified means that the equipment can be used 
in wet and/or salty conditions that may have some wave action. 
Water and electricity together improperly can be dangerous. The 
specific requirements here are open to interpretation and probably 
an engineer familiar with marinas would be helpful.
We like to call floating photovoltaics phloat-o-voltaics—a term 
invented 15 years ago by a company named SPG Solar!
690.6 Alternating-Current (Ac) Modules
Outline of 690.6 Alternating-Current (Ac) Modules:
Alternating-Current (Ac) Modules
A PV Source Circuits
B Output Circuit
Discussion: 690.6 is stating the obvious.
690.6(A) PV Source Circuits
What it means: ac modules are tested and listed as a unit, so we 
do not need to consider any dc circuits, such as PV source circuits.
It is interesting to note that, with a microinverter, we consider 
the dc conductors between the module and the inverter a PV 
source circuit, but not with an ac module.
690.6(B) Output Circuit
It says: The output of an ac module is considered an inverter 
output circuit.
Discussion: This is obvious but needs to be explained in case 
an AHJ gives you a problem. A question PV professionals often 
have is: “What is the difference between an ac module and a 
microinverter bolted to a PV module?” The answer is that if the 
PV module was listed to UL 1703 or UL 61730 while the inverter 
was bolted to it, and if the inverter was tested and listed to UL 20 690 PV Systems Overview and 690 Part I
1741 while bolted to the PV module, then it is an ac module and 
we do not consider the dc part of the product when installing this 
module.
AC PV Module UL Testing 
If the module and microinverter were not listed together, then 
we are responsible for applying the NEC to the dc circuit, 
going from the module to the inverter. It is also interesting 
to note that the word “microinverter” does not appear in the 
NEC. The NEC looks at a microinverter as nothing more 
than a small (micro) inverter.
Certification Listings for PV Modules
The listing that we have been used to for years for PV 
modules was UL 1703, however in 2020 there was a new 
listing, which is 61730. The main reason for this change, 
is so that one single test can be used globally. Before, if 
we wanted to use the same PV module in both Europe 
and the US, it would have to go through at least two sets 
of tests: the CE test for Europe, and the UL test for the 
US. If you look closely at the number, you can see that if 
you put a 6 before 1703 and then switch 0 and 3, you get 
61730. The 6 in front of the listing is for IEC (International 
Electrotechnical Commission) and 61703 was taken, hence 
we have 61730.
If a PV module was first designed before December 2020, 
even if it is still being made, then you can still use the UL 
1703 listing. If it was a new product after December 2020, 
then it should have the UL 61730 listing.
Requiring fewer mostly redundant tests for a global PV 
module helps bring down the price of PV.

Understanding 690.7 sets true solar professionals apart from the

Electricians are accustomed to having the grid or a factory￾set device provide a reference voltage for calculations. With PV,

690.7 Maximum Voltage
There are different ways of defining and calculating voltage, which 
we will describe below. The maximum voltage shall be the highest 
voltage between any two conductors of a circuit, or any conductor 
and ground.
690.7(1) PV dc circuits not to exceed 1000V on buildings
Discussion: PV dc circuits on buildings other than those 
described below in 690.7(2) and 690.7(3) cannot exceed 1000V.
690.7(2) PV dc circuits not to exceed 600V on 1- and 2-family

be over 600V.
690.7(3) PV circuits exceeding 1000V on buildings shall comply

Analysis: This is new in the 2023 NEC. 690.31(G), which we will 
cover in detail later, allows limited dc PV circuits to run along the 
sides of buildings, so now you can have an inverter between 1000V 
and 1500V on the ground wired to an inverter that is mounted on 
the side of a building! This is common sense going into the NEC, 
even when it comes to rapid shutdown. Stay tuned.690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 23
690.7(A) Photovoltaic Source Circuits
PV source circuits (which include PV string circuits) get their 
voltage directly from series connected solar cells. The NEC will 
consider two factors that increase PV source circuit voltage. First, 
putting modules in series increases the voltage. Secondly, cold tem￾perature increases the voltage.
690.7(A) Informational Note
An informational note is a good idea, not a requirement. The NEC 
tells us that a good place to find cold temperature data that we can 
use in determining voltage for locations in the United States is the 
ASHRAE Handbook. A very convenient place to find this data is 
at the website for the Expedited Permit Process: www.solarabcs.
org/permitting.
What is Cold? 
The Solar America Board for Codes and Standards website 
for the Expedited Permit Process is a document that was 
put together by Bill Brooks under contract of the United 
States Department of Energy (USDOE). On the left side of 
the www.solarabcs.org webpage, click on Expedited Permit 
Process and then click on “map of solar reference points” to 
find the low temperature data to use for calculating voltage. 
This webpage also has high temperature data that can be 
used for wire sizing, which we will cover later in this book.
The Expedited Permit Process is a template, which includes 
fill-in forms that can be used to put together a permit 
package. Regardless of whether you use the templates, there 
is a lot of good information to study by downloading the 
82-page Expedited Permit Process “full report.” Anyone in 
the solar industry will benefit from becoming familiar with 
this report. It also helps when studying for the NABCEP PV 
Installation Professional exam. There is another new version 
of this permitting process funded by the USDOE, called the 
Simplified Permit Process, that Bill put together at www.
solsmart.org/permitting.24 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
The temperature that we use is called the ASHRAE 
extreme annual mean minimum design dry bulb temperature. 
This means that half of the years on record, the temperature 
will get colder. Dry bulb gives us the ambient temperature, 
whereas a wet bulb will be cooler because of evaporation, 
except in 100% humidity. Remember that this is not the 
record low temperature, which was commonly used in the 
past. There are a few reasons why we do not need to worry 
about this record low, including the following.
(1) If the sun is shining on the PV, then the PV will be 
warmer than ambient.
(2) The irradiance on a cold PV module is usually much 
lower than 1000 W/m2
.
(3) PV module degradation will lower the voltage.
(4) If the inverter is on, then it will be operating at Vmp, 
which is significantly lower than Voc.
The 2023 NEC, like the 2020 NEC, gives us three ways to 
determine voltage and we can make a choice of which method we 
will use. These methods will result in different values of voltage, 
depending on the method we chose to use.
The three methods for determining PV source circuit (string) 
voltage are:
690.7(A)(1) Calculations
690.7(A)(2) Table 690.7(a)
690.7(A)(3) Engineering Supervision
690.7 (A)(1) Voltage Temperature Calculation Method
The 690.7(A)(1) method is the most common method used by solar 
professionals for determining PV source circuit (string) voltage. 
This method is also required for anyone taking any NABCEP PV 
certification exam.
In order to calculate the module maximum voltage, you will 
need three things:690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 25
(1) Low temperature (ASHRAE value)
(2) Temperature coefficient of Voc for the PV module
(3) Rated PV Module Voc (open-circuit voltage at STC)
Module Voc and temperature coefficient of Voc is most commonly 
found on the PV module manufacturer’s datasheet. Low tempera￾ture data is most easily found at www.solarabcs.org/permitting.
Let us run through a PV source circuit maximum voltage calcu￾lation using a simple example with round numbers.
Example:
(1) Cold Temp = −5°C
(2) Temp. Coef Voc = −0.3%/°C
(3) Voc = 40V
(4) Number of modules in series = 10
Calculation:
(1) Determine delta T (difference in temperature) from Standard 
Testing Conditions (STC).
a. All PV modules are tested at STC = 25°C
b. The difference between −5°C and 25°C is 30°C or −30°C.
(2) Multiply delta T by Temp. Coef. Voc.
a. 30°C × 0.3%/°C = 9% increase in voltage
b. Another easier method converts percent to decimal first.
1. 30°C × 0.003 = 0.09
(3) Add 1 to figure above to get 109% increase in voltage
a. 0.09 + 1 = 1.09
This figure is a temperature correction factor.
(4) Multiply the temperature correction factor by Voc at STC to 
get cold temperature Voc.
a. 1.09 × 40V = 43.6V = maximum voltage for one module
(5) 10 in series × 43.6V = 436V maximum voltage for the PV source 
circuit (string)
When practiced, the method above can be done in 10 seconds by 
fast calculator users. If you practice this 10 times fast, you will be 26 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
an expert. This method can be done easily with a calculator and 
without writing anything down. On the calculator keypad, press:
25 + 5 = 30 (if the 5°C were above 0 then subtract 5 from 25 to 
get 20)
30 × .003 =.09
.09 + 1 = 1.09
1.09 × 40 = 43.6V = maximum voltage for one module
Often, we do string sizing with this number, which means we 
divide it into the inverter maximum input voltage and then round 
down to get the maximum number of modules in series without 
going over voltage.
Example using 43.6V maximum voltage and 450V inverter:
450V/43.6V = 10.3
10 modules is the maximum number in series without going over 
voltage (always round down here). In this example, if we have 10 
in series, then the maximum system voltage is:
10 in series × 43.6V = 436V = maximum system voltage
It is very common for solar un-professionals to incorrectly write 
that the maximum system voltage is 450V on the label in this 
example, which is incorrect. 436V is correct.
Once practiced, you should be able to do this calculation 
without paper using a calculator in less than a minute. The world 
record is 14.1 seconds (3 seconds faster than the previous edition 
of this book and 14 seconds slower than the Rain Man method).
You do not use this method for dc-to-dc converters (optimizers), 
which is a common mistake. There are some module level power 
electronics (MLPE) which do require string sizing, so be sure to 
read the instructions when you are using MLPEs.
String Sizing
With string sizing calculations, and others, there are many 
paths to the correct answer. Try to not just memorize a 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 27
formula, but to understand the steps—this way, when you 
make a mistake, which we all do, you will catch yourself. One 
trick I use with this calculation is making the delta T a posi￾tive number, just to make things easier for non-engineers. 
Then I just know that when it gets colder, the voltage goes up.
You can also string size for your short string, but this is an 
efficiency calculation and not a Code issue. The differences 
are that you use the Vmp, rather than the Voc, then you 
make the Delta T the difference between the hot solar cell 
temperature (about 30°C hotter than ambient hot tempera￾ture) and STC. You will take the delta T and multiply it 
by the temperature coefficient of power or Vmp, which is a 
larger number than the coefficient of Voc. The temperature 
coefficient of Vmp is usually not given, so the temperature 
coefficient of power is a good substitute. You then calcu￾late the correction factor by subtracting rather than adding 
as you do for cold temperatures. For example, if your hot 
ambient temperature is 40C and your hot cell temperature 
is 70C, then your delta T is 70C – 25C = 45C. Then let’s 
say that your temperature coefficient of Vmp or power is –
0.4%/C. So, turn the percentage into a decimal by moving 
the decimal to the left two spaces and you get -0.004/C. 
Then multiply 45C × –0.004 = 0.18, which corresponds to 
an 18% loss. Now we are going to do subtraction for the 
loss of voltage, so 1 – 0.18 = 0.82 correction factor. Then we 
multiply the Vmp by 0.82 to get our hot temperature Vmp. 
We can then divide this hot temperature into our lowest 
voltage that we want, which can be the inverter low max￾imum power point tracking (MPPT) voltage. Make sure to 
round up this time, since we do not want to go below the 
operating voltage window. Usually, people want closer to 
the longest string, rather than the shortest string. You can 
also take into consideration PV module degradation here, 
so you do not go too low 10 years from now. It used to be 
that inverters did not have built-in dc-to-dc converters and 
had transformers, which limited the voltage window and, in 
some places, the longest string for the winter was sometimes 
too short for the hot summers.28 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
Summary: For short string sizing, use hot temperature 
Vmp, which is less than Vmp, and round up to stay in the 
voltage window.
690.7(A)(2) Table Method for Calculating Voltage
Using Table 690.7(a) is easier than performing the 690.7(A)(1) 
Voltage Temperature Calculation Method. We can consider this 
optional method a shortcut; however, in some cases, we will have 
more options for more modules in series using the 690.7(A)(1) cal￾culation method. The 690.7(A)(2) method using Table 690.7(a) is 
more conservative and will come up with a slightly higher module 
voltage every time.
We use Table 690.7(a) by cross-referencing a temperature with 
a temperature correction factor. We then multiply the temperature 
correction factor by the module open-circuit voltage to get the 
module maximum voltage.
Table 2.1 NEC Table 690.7(a) voltage correction factors for crystalline 
and multicrystalline silicon modules. Correction factors for 
ambient temperatures below 25°C (77°F). (Multiply the rated 
open-circuit voltage by the appropriate correction factor shown 
below.)

Let us use the 690.7(A)(2) method using Table 690.7(a), using 
the same numbers that we just used in the 690.7(A)(1) calcu￾lation example; however, this time we will not use the module 
manufacturer’s temperature coefficient for open-circuit voltage.
Example:
(1) Cold temp = −5°C
(2) Voc = 40V
(3) Number of modules in series = 10
Calculation using Table 690.7(a)
(1) Looking at Table 690.7(a) at −5°C, we can see that −5°C cor￾responds with a temperature correction factor of 1.12 (12% 
increase in voltage)
(2) Multiply 1.12 × 40V and get 44.8V
(3) 10 in series × 44.8V = 448V maximum system voltage
We can see by the results of comparing the 690.7(A)(1) calcula￾tion method to the 690.7(A)(2) table method, that the 690.7(a) table 
method resulted in a higher voltage that is very close to the 450V 
inverter maximum voltage.
If it were 1° colder at −6°C we would still be able to have 10 
in series with the 690.7(A)(1) calculation method, but we would 
have gone over voltage using the 690.7(A)(2) table method using 
Table 690.7(a).
We can see that at −6°C in Table 690.7(a) we have a temperature 
correction factor of 1.14.
40V × 1.14 = 45.6V
45.6V × 10 in series = 456V = over voltage for our 450V inverter 
example
690.7(A)(3) Engineering Supervision Method for Calculating Maximum 
Voltage for PV Systems over 100kW Generating Capacity (Ac System 
Size)
Under engineering supervision, there can be alternative ways of 
doing things throughout the NEC. According to 690.7(A)(3), a 30 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
licensed professional electrical engineer will have to stamp the 
system design. A professional engineer (PE) has gone to school, 
worked in the field, and taken a difficult exam. The designation 
of PE is awarded on the state level. It is up to the AHJ to accept a 
stamp of a PE who is licensed in another state.
The 690.7(A)(3) Engineering Supervision Method requires that 
the PE uses an “industry standard method” for determining max￾imum voltage.
690.7(A)(3) INFORMATIONAL NOTE
There is an informational note that recommends an “industry 
standard method” for calculating maximum voltage of a PV system.
Industry Standard Method for Calculating Maximum Voltage:
Photovoltaic Array Performance Model
Sandia National Laboratory
SAND 2004-3535 www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/919131
Insiders like Bill call this the David King method, since he was an 
author.
To summarize the report as far as voltage goes: Taking the 
heating effects of irradiance into consideration, the tempera￾ture of the PV will be hotter than ambient, and we can have 
a lower module voltage and perhaps another two modules in 
series. Different solar software, such as NRELs System Advisor 
Model (SAM), PVsyst and Helioscope, can model using the 
Sandia Model.
690.7(B) Dc-to-Dc Converter Circuits
Dc-to-dc converter source and output circuits shall be calculated 
in accordance with 690.7(B)(1) and 690.7(B)(2).
690.7(B)(1) Single Dc-to-Dc Converter
For a single dc-to-dc converter output, the maximum voltage is the 
maximum rated output of the dc-to-dc converter.
Maximum voltage is what it says on the label, installation 
instructions, or datasheet for maximum output voltage.690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 31
Mostly we see dc-to-dc converters in series with each other in 
the context of the NEC, such as with SolarEdge Optimizers; how￾ever, a maximum power point tracking charge controller is essen￾tially a dc-to-dc converter. If a charge controller can limit current 
coming from the battery, then it is not part of the PV system. PV 
systems only encompass currents coming from PV.
Dc-to-Dc Converters in Modern PV and Energy Storage 
Systems
As electronics mature, we are seeing dc-to-dc conversion 
taking place throughout the industry. These are at the inputs 
of our multiple MPP inverters, MPP charge controllers, and 
within our energy storage systems. One of the reasons that ac 
became our grid rather than dc, is because Tesla pioneered 
the technology to change ac voltage with transformers, 
Figure 2.1 Tesla using improper PPE with alternating current.

which work for alternating current and not direct current. 
Now, with efficient modern dc conversion technology, we are 
seeing more applications for dc circuits. Watch out Nikola 
Tesla, Thomas Edison is coming for you!
690.7 B)(2) Two or More Series Connected Dc-to-Dc Converters
Maximum voltage is determined in accordance with instructions of 
the dc-to-dc converter.
If instructions are not included, sum up the voltage of the dc￾to-dc converters connected in series.
Discussion: Dc-to-dc converters can electronically limit voltage
when connected in series. There are, however, some dc-to-dc 
converters that, along with having the capability to convert 
voltages, also can bypass the converter internally and send PV 
voltage through the converter. Dc-to-dc converter installation 
instructions and help lines will be your best source of determining 
maximum voltage.
The most commonly used dc-to-dc converter as of the writing 
of this book has a maximum system voltage between 480V and 
1000V, which you can find in the datasheet or installation manual.
690.7(C) Bipolar PV Source Circuits
A bipolar circuit has a positive grounded monopole circuit and 
a negative grounded monopole circuit. Maximum voltage is 
considered voltage to ground.
If there is a ground-fault or an arc-fault, the inverter is required 
to isolate both circuits from each other and from ground.
Discussion: From a safety point of view, the voltage of your 
house is limited to 120V to ground since voltage to ground relates 
to safety. In a similar way, a bipolar system with a maximum 
voltage of 1000V to ground can have a voltage of 2000V measured 
array to array! However, a 2000V bipolar system is allowed to use 
1000V rated PV modules since the modules never see more than 
1000V in this configuration. We have not seen bipolar inverters 
used in about a decade but expect to see them sometime between 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 33
the publication of this book and the publication of our future 
book on the 2026 NEC. We can tell the future.
690.7(D) Marking Dc PV circuits
690 Part VI Marking is no longer in the 2023 NEC, as it was in 
the 2020 NEC. 690.53 DC PV Circuits (in Part VI Marking) was 
moved over here to 690.7(D) and there were no changes, besides 
the move.
Dc PV circuits require a label at one of the following locations:
(1) Dc PV system disconnecting means
(2) PV system electronic power conversion equipment
(3) Distribution equipment associated with PV system
All this sign requires now is the maximum dc voltage from 690.7.
In previous versions of the Code, we had requirements for max￾imum circuit current in 2017 NEC, along with operating voltage 
(Vmp) and current (Imp) in 2014 and earlier versions of the NEC.
There are no color, size, or reflective requirements in the NEC 
for the 690.53 Dc PV Circuits sign, so get creative! All it has to be 
is permanent and readily visible.
Summing up 2023 NEC changes in 690.7:
(1) We can have circuits over 1000V on buildings if you follow 
the restrictions, so you can mount your inverter for a ground 
mounted PV system on a building.
(2) We are getting rid of “output circuit” terminology for wild PV, 
dc-to-dc converters, and bipolar circuits.
(3) Dc voltage marking requirements that were in 690.53 are now 
in 690.7.
Most changes here and in general are organizational and/or 
made to clarify things. The only real 690.7 change is the part about 
being able to put your dc circuits over 1000V on the building, and 
the details and limitations for that can be seen at 690.31(G) on 
page 122. This does not mean that we can put a PV array over 
1000V on any building, just part of the circuit. Which usually is 
going to an inverter that we can now hang on a wall.34 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements

690.8 Circuit Sizing and Current
This is how we define current and ampacity for wire sizing and 
equipment selection. Wire sizing is not simple, so pay close 
attention and come back often. 690.8(A) defines what current is 
and 690.8(B) defines the required ampacity of the wire.
690.8(A) and 690.8(B) Overview
Reinforce in your synapses that 690.8(A) defines currents used 
for wire sizing and 690.8(B) gives us different checks to perform 
to make sure that the wire can handle the current under different 
conditions, such as heat and being oversized for continuous 
current.
There are still other checks used for wire sizing regarding 
overcurrent protection found in Article 240 of the NEC. In 
Article 240 Overcurrent Protection we have to make sure that 
the overcurrent protection device is going to protect the wire. See 
wiring sizing examples in Chapter 12, the most difficult chapter in 
the book.690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 35
690.8(A) Calculation of Maximum Circuit Current
We will define currents used for wire sizing for different circuits 
in a PV system. PV system currents are more complicated than 
currents in circuits most electricians are used to dealing with. 
This is because we have some circuit currents that increase with the 
brightness of light and other circuit currents that are limited by 
smart electronics.
690.8(A)(1) PV System Circuits
690.8(A)(1) says currents are determined by 690.8(A)(1)(a) through 
690.8(A)(1)(c). There was a little rearranging here in the 2023 NEC 
with the PV output circuit and dc-to-dc converter output circuit 
definitions being removed, and then combined under the headings 
of PV source circuits and dc-to-dc converter circuits. Currents are 
still the same here, it is just a different arrangement (FPN: an amp 
is still about 6 quintillion electrons passing by in a second).
690.8(A)(1)(a)(1) 125% OF SHORT-CIRCUIT CURRENT METHOD
This is the typical way we define maximum circuit current for 
“wild” PV circuits and is the way we have always done it in the past:
125% of short-circuit current
Isc × 1.25 = maximum circuit current
Discussion: This is the definition of maximum circuit current 
for one module, or a number of modules connected together in 
series. Some would argue that it is overdoing it to base your wire 
size on a short circuit. This is done because we are accounting for 
increased irradiance over STC (1000 w/m2
).
Also, it is unusual for electricians to see a short circuit that 
is only about 7% more than operating current, as it is with PV 
modules. Usually when you short something besides PV, a huge 
amount of current tries to rush in and then an overcurrent protec￾tion device opens the circuit.
Let’s look at some of the PV module circuit currents in order of 
increasing current:36 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
Imp = current at maximum power (not a code thing, but your 
operating current at STC)
Isc = short-circuit current
Isc × 1.25 = Maximum circuit current from applying 690.8(A)(1)
(a)(1)
Isc × 1.56 = Required ampacity for continuous current from 
690.8(B)(1) for wild PV
Note: Maximum circuit current (Isc × 1.25) was required on the 
label of dc disconnects in the 2017 NEC; however the requirement 
was discontinued in the 2020 NEC.
It is considered by many smart people to be overdoing it by 
using 125% of short-circuit current to define maximum circuit 
current. The reason it was not a big deal in the past is because PV 
was so expensive that oversizing wires was done to keep as much 
of our expensive energy as possible from being lost in the wires 
(voltage drop). Since we have entered the age of inexpensive PV 
energy, it makes more sense to use a smaller wire than it used to, 
and this leads us to a new way to define current in 690.8(A)(1)(a)
(2), the Engineering Supervision Method.
Irradiance Outside of Earth’s Atmosphere
It is interesting to note that Imp × irradiance in space at 
Earth’s orbit, which is about 1366W per square meter, is 
about equal to Isc × 1.25.
Imp × 1.366 = Isc × 1.25
Coincidence or conspiracy? Clearly the Martians are 
planning to suck away our atmosphere and want to make 
sure our electrical code does not need to change after our 
atmosphere is gone …
690.8(A)(1)(a)(2) ENGINEERING SUPERVISION METHOD FOR CALCULATING 
MAXIMUM CIRCUIT CURRENT FOR PV SYSTEMS OVER 100KW GENERATING 
CAPACITY (AC SYSTEM SIZE)
As with 690.7(A)(3) for determining voltage, 690.8(A)(1)(a)(2) 
allows a licensed professional electrical engineer (PE) to use an 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 37
industry standard method. This method is based on the highest three￾hour current average from simulated local irradiance accounting for 
elevation and orientation.
This industry standard method must also not be less than 70% 
of the 125% of Isc value used in 690.8(A)(1)(a)(1).
Since 690.8(A)(1)(a)(1) is Isc × 1.25, then the industry standard 
method cannot be less than 70% of 125% of Isc, so 0.7 × 
1.25 = 0.875
This means that this industry standard method cannot be less 
than 87.5% of Isc.
We could call this the not less than 87.5% Isc method.
This does not mean that the PE does not have to do anything 
besides multiply Isc × 0.875. The PE will also have to analyze the 
PV system, including taking irradiance, elevation, and orientation 
into consideration.
Higher elevation causes more current, due to less atmospheric 
filtering (closer to space).

towards the same report mentioned earlier in 690.7 for voltage

The 156 Factor
Current and ampacity with PV source circuits has confused 
many prospective solar professionals. When both 690.8(A)
(1)(a)(1) and 690.8(B)(1) are applied simultaneously, a 
resulting multiplication factor of 156% is used. Oftentimes 
people try to apply this 156% factor to circuits besides PV 
source circuits. This multiplication factor is only applied to 
circuits that are directly and proportionally influenced by sun￾light and not circuits that are limited by electronics. We can 
call this “wild PV” when PV is not limited by electronics.
156% comes from two different 125% correction factors. 
The 690.8(A)(1)(a)(1) correction factor is for natural irradi￾ance beyond the standard testing conditions of 1000W per 
square meter, which is how all PV modules are tested and 
rated. The other 125% in 690.8(B)(1) is the required ampacity 
for continuous current that we have for all our solar circuits. 
Continuous current as defined in the NEC is a current that 
can last over three hours. PV can last all day—particularly in 
tracking systems! Required ampacity for continuous current 
is not a current, it is more like a safety factor, and a way to 
get you to buy more copper or aluminum.
As a side note, did you know that many silicon solar cells 
are 156mm × 156mm? Coincidence or photovoltaic numer￾ologist conspiracy? See page 156 and read it backwards 
(kidding).690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 39
This 156% of Isc factor was a 690.8(A) informational 
note that was removed in the 2020 NEC because everyone 
read the first edition of this book and no longer needed the 
information.
690.8(A)(1)(b) DC-TO-DC CONVERTER CIRCUIT CURRENT
The maximum current shall be the sum of the parallel connected 
continuous current output rating.
Discussion: Dc-to-dc converters can electronically control 
current and voltage. In the instructions of the dc-to-dc converter 
there should be details on what the maximum current of the 
circuit can be. One of the benefits of the dc-to-dc converter is 
its smart ability to limit current, so that smaller wires can be 
used. For the most commonly used dc-to-dc converter (initials 
SE) at the time of this writing, the current of a dc-to-dc con￾verter source circuit is 15A for some products. Converter source 
circuit currents are rising with 18A and even higher currents 
becoming common. It is also humorous that they tell us to use 
a wire size that is at least 11 AWG. Has anyone ever seen an 
11 AWG wire? At least we don’t need to have a greater-than or 
equal-to sign there.
Combiners Combining Combiners
In many utility scale systems, combined PV circuits will 
be combined again in other dc combiners, which are 
sometimes called “recombiners.” The IEC (International 
Electrotechnical Commission) calls what the NEC calls a “dc 
combiner” an “array junction box” if there is a single level 
of combining and if there are two levels of combining, then 
what we call the “dc combiner” in the NEC is called the “sub￾array junction box” and the next level of combining is called 
the “array junction box.”
The NEC term for a combiner box is dc combiner.40 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
690.8(A)(1)(c) INVERTER OUTPUT CIRCUIT CURRENT
The maximum current shall be the inverter continuous current 
output rating.
Discussion: The current is often marked on the inverter. If 
current is not marked on the inverter, you can calculate current by 
dividing power by operating voltage. It is interesting to note that 
dividing power by voltage does not always get the exact same value 
for current as the inverter datasheet. This can be due to changes 
in power factor (current and voltage being out of phase with each 
other and causing a higher current than power divided by voltage 
would indicate). This is one reason we see equipment such as 
transformers rated in apparent power, such as kVA, rather than 
real power, such as kW.
690.8(A)(2) Circuits Connected to the Input of Electronic Power 
Converters
Protecting circuits the old fashioned way (was new in 2020 NEC).
NEC wording: Where a circuit is protected with an overcurrent 
device not exceeding the conductor ampacity, the maximum 
current shall be permitted to be the rated input current of the elec￾tronic power converter input to which it is connected.
What this means: We have always based the conductor size 
(current) of the PV dc circuits based on the rating of the currents 
coming from the direction of the PV (think Isc × 1.25). Now we are 
allowed another way to size these circuits based on the maximum 
current that the electronic power converter can accept. An electronic 
power converter is usually the input of an interactive inverter.
This is very much like sizing the input of a battery inverter. 
We do not size a battery inverter input circuit based on the short 
circuit rating of the battery, which could be many thousands of 
amps. We will put an overcurrent device between the battery and 
the battery inverter and then size the wire based on the maximum 
current that the battery inverter will accept. This is also how many 
circuits are sized, such as loads on the grid. We do not size the 
loads based on the short circuit rating of the grid, we size load 
circuits based on how much current the load can take and then put 
an overcurrent device on the circuit, to protect from overcurrents 
and short circuits. As PV goes down in price, we are more likely to 
oversize the PV array and invoke 690.8(A)(2).690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 41
Summary: We can also size electronic power converter input 
circuits based on the maximum input current if the circuit is 
protected by an OCPD (overcurrent protection device).

calculations. These calculations are nothing new to the NEC and

Storage Systems, which we cover in Chapter 10.42 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
Attention! The following is an important part of 690.8(B) that 
needs to be understood and is commonly misunderstood:
Word-for-word NEC:
690.8(B) Conductor Ampacity: Circuit conductors shall have an 
ampacity not less than the larger of 690.8(B)(1) or (B)(2)
The text in bold above needs to be properly understood before 
going further. We will do a check for 690.8(B)(1) and we will also 
do a check for 690.8(B)(2), and then we will choose the larger wire 
of the two checks. The wire will always be able to carry as much or 
more current than the device it is connected to, to be on the safe 
side. There will also be other checks. (See Chapter 12 Wire Sizing
for examples).
Ampacity = Current-carrying ability
690.8(B)(1) Without Adjustment and Correction Factors
Here we account for required ampacity for continuous current by 
multiplying the currents we defined in 690.8(A) by 1.25.
Or said more simply:
690.8(A) defined current × 1.25 = 690.8(B)(1) required ampacity.
Some people call this 690.8(B)(1) value “current.” It is not 
really current; it is a required ampacity that is more than the actual 
current in order to be extra safe due to current lasting three hours 
or more (continuous current).
690.8(B)(1) = Required Ampacity for Continuous Current
About Continuous Currents
PV system currents are continuous. Throughout the Code, 
we size wires much like we do in Article 690, and since our 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 43
earth spins slowly (it takes a whole day!), the sunlight can 
last three hours or more, making PV currents subject to the 
1.25 correction factor for continuous currents. This is where 
the 690.8(B)(1) correction factor comes from.
Terminal announcement regarding 690.8(B)(1) value!
Terminal = what the end (terminal) of a wire is connected 
to. Example: screw terminal. Why do we take terminal tem￾perature limits into consideration?
If a wire is connected to a terminal, there can be some 
resistance at the connection and the terminal can heat up. 
The wire can act as a heat sink absorbing heat from the hot 
terminal. Additionally, if the wire heats up and is connected 
to the terminal, the terminal will also become hot.
If you open up your NEC to Table 310.16 or 310.17, you will 
see values for ampacity for a particular wire that change as you go 
across the table, depending on the temperature rating of the insu￾lation of the conductor. We see 60°C ampacity on the left next to 
75°C ampacity and then 90°C ampacity. A conductor that has an 
insulation rating that can be hotter will be able to carry more current.
Terminals have temperature limits, and terminals that are 75°C 
rated and used with 90°C rated wires are most common in the solar 
industry. In general, when doing the 690.8(B)(1) check, we use the 
75°C column in the 310.16 and 17 tables in this case.
If we were using 90°C rated terminals with 75°C rated wire, 
we would use the 75°C column, since it is less than 90°C. It is so 
uncommon to purposely use 90°C terminals with 75°C wire that 
the only time it is done is when someone is making a mistake. 90°C 
terminals are rare on both ends of a circuit. Both ends of the cir￾cuit must have 90°C rated equipment to use the 90°C ampacity at 
the terminals. This is still done sometimes. 90°C terminals usually 
require compression lugs, rather than screw terminals and com￾pression lugs can require a hydraulic crimper.
On another note, the NEC tells us that if the terminal 
temperatures are not indicated, we should assume 60°C terminals 
if the terminals are rated for 100A or less. This situation of 
assuming 60°C terminals is probably only seen on an exam. The 
vast majority of PV equipment has 75°C or 90°C terminals.44 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
This terminal temperature logic is only used for the 690.8(B)(1) 
check and not for the 690.8(B)(2) check. Repeat for emphasis: do 
not use terminal temperatures or the 125% correction when doing 
the 690.8(B)(2) check, only for 690.8(B)(1).
Terminal Temperature NEC Reference
Article 110 Requirements for Electrical Installations:
110.14 Electrical Connections
110.14(C) Temperature Limitations
110.14(C) reads: “The temperature rating associated with the 
ampacity of a conductor shall be selected and coordinated so 
as not to exceed the lowest temperature rating of any connected 
termination, conductor, or device. Conductors with tempera￾ture ratings higher than specified for terminations shall be 
permitted to be used for ampacity adjustment, correction, 
or both.”
Essentially, what this is saying is that the terminal is rated for 
a certain temperature (75°C for instance). The conductor can 
reach 75°C, but is not permitted to get hotter than 75°C. When 
we apply conditions of use [adjustment and correction factors 
from 690.8(B)(2)], we are doing calculations that approximate 
how much current it takes to get the copper to 75°C. We don’t 
do anything to the terminal. It’s just reflecting the conductor 
temperature.
If we analyze the last sentence in 110.14(C)—
Conductors with temperature ratings higher than specified for 
terminations shall be permitted to be used for ampacity adjust￾ment, correction, or both.
—we see that we do not need to apply the terminal temperature 
rating when we are applying adjustment factors, which we will read 
about next.690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 45
690.8(B)(2) With Adjustment and Correction Factors
The conductor ampacity should be able to handle the currents 
as defined in 690.8(A)(1) after the application of correction and 
adjustment factors.
Here are the correction and adjustment factors in the 2023 NEC:
(1) Table 310.15(B)(1)(1) Ambient Temp. Correction Factors
Based on 30°C
(2) Table 310.15(C)(1) Adjustment Factors for More than Three 
Current-Carrying Conductors
Additional adjustment in 2014 NEC, but not in later NECs:
(1) Table 310.15(B)(3)(c) Ambient Temperature Adjustment 
for Raceways or Cables Exposed to Sunlight on or Above 
Rooftops no longer exists.
• In 2023 NEC according to 310.15(B)(2), if Raceway is 
¾ inch or less above the roof, we still add 33°C to ambient 
temperature. We advise never putting your wiring so close 
to the roof. This was reduced from ⅞ inch in the 2020 NEC. 
Besides being hotter closer to the roof, being that close does 
not allow space for debris to go under the conduit.
These 690.8(B)(2) adjustment factors are also commonly called 
“conditions of use” since the adjustments have to do with wires 
put in areas where there will be more heat as with Table 310.15(B)
(1)(1) Ambient Temp. Correction Factors Based on 30°C or where 
the wires will have less of an ability to dissipate heat as with 
Table 310.15(C)(1) Adjustment Factors for More than Three 
Current-Carrying Conductors.
Remember that when we apply these 690.8(B)(2) correction and 
adjustment factors, we do not apply the criteria in 690.8(B)(1) such 
as the 125% continuous current calculation or the terminal tempera￾ture limits.
TABLE 310.15(B)(1)(1) AMBIENT TEMP. CORRECTION FACTORS BASED ON 30°C
This table is used to correct (some say derate) the ampacity of 
conductors in Tables 310.16 and 310.17 for temperatures that 
are different from 30°C. Tables 310.16 and 310.17 are based on 46 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
temperatures of 30°C, which makes the tables all an electrician has 
to use if working inside of a building that is not a sauna. When we 
are working outside of a building in the sun, temperatures can get 
hotter than 30°C and we can compensate for this by multiplying the 
conductor ampacity by the derating factor in Table 310.15(B)(1)(1).
What is Hot? 
A good place to find high ambient temperatures to use for 
wire sizing is the www.solarabcs.org/permitting Expedited 
Permit Process map of solar reference points where we also 
found the cold temperatures that we used for calculating 
voltage in 690.7. It is recommended to use the temperature 
value given as the ASHRAE 2% high temperature for wire 
sizing (no need to use the higher 0.4% high temperature). 
This is not a record high temperature, but a temperature 
agreed on by many industry experts and copper barons (the 
Copper Development Association).
310.15(C)(1) ADJUSTMENT FACTORS FOR MORE THAN THREE CURRENT￾CARRYING CONDUCTORS
If there are more than three current-carrying wires together 
in a raceway or cable, then we use the adjustment factors in 
Table 310.15(C)(1). The reason we do this adjustment is that the 
extra conductors in a tight space will generate more heat that has 
to be dissipated.
We do not count a neutral that is only carrying unbalanced 
currents from other conductors in the same circuit as a current￾carrying conductor. We also do not count equipment grounding
conductors since they do not carry current.
TABLE 310.15(B)(3)(C) AMBIENT TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENT FOR RACEWAYS 
OR CABLES EXPOSED TO SUNLIGHT ON OR ABOVE ROOFTOPS (LAST SEEN IN 
2014 NEC)
In the 2014, 2011, and 2008 NEC according to Table 310.15(B)(3)
(c), we had to add to the ambient temperature a temperature adder 
if there were conductors in a raceway exposed to sunlight over a 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 47
rooftop. The reasoning behind this temperature adder is that a 
conduit in sunlight can act like a solar thermal heater for wires. 
Apparently, due to global cooling, it was not a serious enough con￾sideration to leave the table in the 2017, 2020, and 2023 NECs.
The 2023 NEC still tells us to add 33°C to raceways or cables that are 
less than 3/4 inch above the roof in sunlight. We recommend installing 
all conductors more than 1 inch above a roof for other reasons 
besides heat. Wiring methods close to the roof encourage debris build￾up, which can cause many other problems, such as roof rot.
To sum up these application of adjustment factors, we take the 
690.8(A)(1) or 690.8(A)(2) defined currents and apply the adjust￾ment factors to determine if the conductor is able to carry the 
current. Oftentimes with rooftop PV it is this adjustment factor 
method that is the weak link and determines the wire size. Recall 
that the brand new 690.8(A)(2) currents are defined by the rated 
input current of electronic power converters.
We will cover these tables in more detail in our wire-sizing 
example chapter at the end of the book in Chapter 12 on page 287.
690.8(C) Systems with Multiple Direct-Current Voltages
If a PV power source has multiple output circuits with multiple 
output voltages and employs a common return conductor, the 
ampacity of the common return conductor shall not be less than 
the sum of the ampere ratings of the overcurrent devices of the 
individual output circuits.
If we use a single common return wire for three circuits, 
the return wire must be capable of handling the current of all 
three circuits. We used to see this done with 48-volt PV systems 
connected to batteries.
690.8(C) is rarely if ever used.
690.8(D) Multiple PV String Circuits
Word-for-word NEC:
Where an overcurrent device is used to protect more than one 
set of parallel-connected PV string circuits, the ampacity of each 
conductor protected by the device shall not be less than the sum
of the following:48 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
690.8(D)(1) The rating of the overcurrent protection device.
690.8(D)(2) The sum of the maximum currents as calculated 
in 690.8(A)(1)(a) for other parallel-connected PV string circuits 
protected by the overcurrent device.
What we are talking about here is common with low current thin 
film PV modules, where you can have multiple strings of modules 
in parallel protected by a single overcurrent protection device, such 
as an inline fuse inside of a wiring harness.
So, the ampacity of each conductor, including those going to 
each PV module, shall not be less than: (the rating of the OCPD) 
+ (the rating of other parallel connected strings).
Say for instance you have five different 1A strings (1A after 
the 690.8(A)(1)(a)(1) 125% calculation) paralleled together before 
being protected by a single 10A fuse. If there were a short circuit 
on one of the conductors on the side of the fuse with the 5 strings, 
then there are two different sources of current. One source is from 
the other 4 strings and the other source is backfeeding from the 
rest of the array through the 10A fuse. This gives us a possibility 
of 14A that the conductor would have to be able to handle, so 
we would need a conductor that was sized to carry at least 14A. 
Additionally, the PV module maximum series fuse rating should 
be at least 14A.
The PV module parallel-connected circuit shown in Figure 2.3 
below is most often used with low current thin film PV modules in 
utility scale projects using central inverters.

circuits.

Discussion: Some PV systems have modules with low current 
and higher voltage. These modules are sometimes connected in 
parallel to a single overcurrent protection device.
If this 690.8(D) discussion was too much for you, join a large 
club and turn the page. This is only relevant to a small fraction 
of a percentage of people designing PV systems using First Solar 
modules. For most of us, just remember that usually greater than 
two in parallel requires fusing.

690.9(D) Exception: Permitted Without OCPD on Inverter Side
Article 690.9 PV Overcurrent Protection follows the line with 
Article 240 Overcurrent Protection, but with special provisions 
for PV that are different from most electricity, such as solar cells 
that produce current based on the brightness of light, the current￾limited aspects of PV, and current that can be flowing in different 
directions.
690.9(A) Circuits and Equipment
“PV system dc circuit and ac inverter output conductors and 
equipment shall be protected against overcurrent.”
Discussion regarding above sentence: Notice how the first sen￾tence in 690.9(A) does not say conductors and equipment must
be protected with overcurrent protection devices (OCPD). This is 
because with current-limited sources, such as with PV systems, it 
is often simple to size the conductors for the highest continuous 
current. In fact, putting an overcurrent protective device in a 
circuit where it will not operate under a short circuit might fool 
people who associate a blown fuse with a short circuit and may 
be more dangerous than no OCPD at all. The more dangerous 
currents come from the utility or a battery. Even a battery behind 
an inverter or dc-to-dc converter is current-limited by the inverter 
or dc-to-dc converter on the side away from the battery.
690.9(A) then goes on to say that overcurrent devices are 
required for circuits sized based on 690.8(B)(2), where the current 
rating of the overcurrent device is based on the rated input current 
of the electronic power converter.
Overcurrent protective devices are not required for circuit 
conductors with sufficient ampacity for highest available currents 
when using 690.9(A)(1).
Examples of current-limited supplies:
• PV modules
• Dc-to-dc converters
• Interactive inverter ac output circuits
Circuits connected to current-limited supplies and connected 
to sources with higher current availability shall be protected at the 
higher current source connection.690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 51
Examples of higher current availability:
• Parallel strings of modules
• Utility power
• Wild batteries
String History
690.9(A) was once the only place in Article 690 where it acci￾dentally said the slang term string. String is a term that was 
always (at least in recent history) defined in the International 
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard.
The IEC is an international standard that is used to align 
Codes around the world. At the beginning of the NEC, on 
the first page of the Code, we can see:
NEC 90.1(C) Relation to Other Standards
The requirements of this Code address the fundamental 
principles of protection for safety contained in Section 
131 of International Electrotechnical Standard 60364–1 
Electrical Installations of Buildings.
This means that the NEC follows the principles of the 
international standard that most places on Earth attempt to 
follow to a degree. Some of these concepts, such as a single￾point of system grounding, are so universal that they are 
even used in the Andromeda Galaxy.
The NEC goes into much more detail regarding PV 
systems than the IEC.
IEC Definition:
PV string: a circuit of series connected modules
In previous and the current versions of the NEC, the term 
string is used for batteries and lights in series. I did not see 
the string switch that you pull to turn the lights out in an old 
closet.52 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
690.9(A)(1) Circuits Where Overcurrent Protection Is Not Required
Not required on both ends where both of the following (A)(1)(1) 
and (A)(1)(2) are met.
690.9(A)(1)(1) Where conductors have sufficient ampacity for 
maximum current.
Overcurrent protection not required if circuit conductors “have 
sufficient ampacity for maximum circuit current.”
690.9(A)(1)(2) Where the currents from all sources do not exceed 
the maximum overcurrent protective device rating specified for 
the PV module or electronic power converter
Discussion: The maximum circuit current of a PV module is 
analogous to the ampacity of the module (including the conductors 
that are part of the module, which is a listed unit).
Just Say No to OCPD (Sometimes)
There are instances where overcurrent protection, if used, 
would create a false sense of security and an unnecessary 
source of nuisance failures (fuses fail even when they don’t 
get overcurrent at times). In these cases, overcurrent protec￾tion is not required.
Since PV itself is current-limited and we size “wild PV” 
fuses at a minimum of 156% of short-circuit current, in 
many cases a short circuit will not open a fuse.
If there are no external sources, such as parallel-connected 
PV source circuits, batteries, or backfeed from inverters, we 
can often forgo the OCPD. (The following example does not 
include the option to size circuits based on the new 690.8(A)
(2) Circuits Connected to the Input of Electronic Power 
Converters, where OCPD is required.)
Let’s give an example: If there is a single string of PV 
connected to an inverter and there is a short circuit of the 
PV source circuit, the overcurrent device would never open 
the circuit. PV source circuit fuses are sized based on 156% of 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 53
short-circuit current and then rounded up to the next common 
overcurrent protection device. If a PV module short-circuit 
current (Isc) is 9A, then the fuse size we would use would be 
calculated as:
9A × 1.56 = 14A then round up to 15A fuse
We round up to the next common overcurrent protection 
device size. Common sizes are found in NEC 240.6 Standard 
Ampere Ratings.
240.4(B) Overcurrent Devices Rated Over 800A tells us that 
when the overcurrent protection device is 800A or greater, the 
conductors it protects must have at least the ampacity of the 
overcurrent protection device. See Chapter 12 wire sizing for 
an example on page 293 where the ampacity of the conductor 
is less than the overcurrent protection device under 800A.
If we had a single string of 9A Isc PV modules short out, 
we would never get enough current to open a 15A fuse.
In fact, if we had a single PV output circuit short out where 
it was connected to an inverter, it still would not have enough 
current to open any properly sized overcurrent protection 
device on the PV output circuit. We could short-circuit a 
MW of PV for 20 years and never blow a fuse!
This is the nature of current-limited PV. In some cases, it 
is safer since we are not exposed to super-high short circuits. 
The arc-flash danger is less, but it can be more dangerous 
in some respects, since, in many cases, we do not experi￾ence large enough currents to open overcurrent protection 
devices, and we have to get creative with our ground fault 
detection and interruption (GFDI).
If short-circuit currents from all sources do not exceed the 
ampacity of the conductors or the maximum overcurrent 
protective device size rating specified for the PV module or 
dc-to-dc converter, then we do not need to have overcurrent 
protection.
This is the example of not needing fuses when you have 
two PV source circuits going to a single inverter input. If 
we have one PV source circuit that is shorted out and the 54 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
currents from the other PV source circuit are backfeeding 
to the shorted PV source circuit, then we would only have 
a maximum of the current from a single PV source circuit. 
We would not have the currents from both strings, since we 
would at most have currents from one PV source circuit 
feeding to another. In this case we do not need a fuse with 
two strings or less. (This is a test: What is less than 2? See 
answer in the upper corner of page 1 of this book.)
Why Do We Even Have PV Source Circuit Fuses?
If we had 50 PV source circuits combining at a dc combiner 
and a single string shorted, then we would get the current 
from 49 PV source circuits backfeeding a single PV source 
circuit. The fuse protecting the single PV source circuit would 
have currents going the reverse direction and would open the 
fuse, even on a cloudy (low current) day. Dc combiner fuses 
are designed to open due to currents going in the reverse dir￾ection when the non-shorted PV source circuits send current 
back through a shorted PV source circuit. Once the fuse 
blows, the remaining 49 PV source circuits may just imme￾diately go back to working without notifying anyone that 
anything happened if there is no monitoring or dc arc-fault 
protection did not turn off the inverter. It is possible that in 
a large array, that there may be many PV source circuits not 
contributing to power.
PV dc circuits are current-limited circuits that only need 
overcurrent protection when connected in parallel to higher 
current sources. The overcurrent device is often installed at the 
higher current source end of the circuit.
Discussion: We install fuses at the source of the overcurrents 
at PV dc combiners. Some think it would be easier if there were 
fuses that came in the junction boxes of PV modules. The source 
of the overcurrents is not from the individual PV modules in 
the individual PV string circuit that is shorted, but from the 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 55
parallel-connected sources feeding back to the shorted PV source 
circuit. Overcurrent protection should be installed at the source of 
the potential overcurrents, which is where the PV source circuits are 
combined, at the dc combiner.
690.9(A)(2) Circuits Where Overcurrent Protection Is Required on 
One End
If the conductor is sufficient for the current-limited supply it is 
connected to at one end, but the conductor is connected on the other 
end to a supply that is greater than the ampacity of the conductor, 
overcurrent protection is installed at the point of connection to the 
higher current source.
Example: When we have a PV module in the field going to a dc 
combiner, we do not put the fuse at the PV module, we put the fuse 
at the dc combiner.
690.9(A)(2) INFORMATIONAL NOTE
The informational note explains that the overcurrent protection 
device is often put at the side of the circuit at the higher current 
source end. An example where this may not be the case is covered 
in 690.9(A)(3) Other Circuits.

because we refer to Article 230 Services, does not mean 
that solar is a “service.”
690.9(B) Device Ratings
Overcurrent protection devices used in PV dc circuits shall be listed
for use in PV systems.
Electronic devices listed to prevent backfeed current in PV 
system dc circuits are permitted to permit overcurrents on the 
array side of the device.
OCPDs are rounded up to the next higher device size in 
accordance with 240.4(B).
OCPDs shall be rated in accordance with 690.9(B)(1) or 
690.9(B)(2) below.
(To see examples of OCPD sizing in action, read Chapter 12
Wire Sizing on page 287)
690.9(B)(1) Not Less Than 125% of Maximum Currents
Overcurrent protection devices must be at least 125% of the 
currents defined in 690.8(A) Maximum Circuit Current. You can 
review those currents defined in 690.8(A)(1) through 690.8(A)(2) 
starting on page 35 of this book. It is important to understand 
how maximum circuit current is defined. 58 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
690.9(B)(2) 100% of Its Rating
If an assembly and its overcurrent protective device is rated for 
continuous use at 100% of its rating, then it does not need to be at 
least 125% of its rating.
Invoking this “100% of its rating” section of the Code is rare, 
used for larger currents and not something most designers of 
smaller PV systems should concern themselves with.
690.9(B) Informational Note
Some devices prevent backfeed current and sometimes the only 
source of overcurrent in a dc PV circuit is a backfeed current.
One-Way Diodes
Back in the day, when most PV systems were stand-alone 
systems, we would insert blocking diodes between the PV and 
the battery to prevent the battery from backfeeding into the 
array at night (causing the array to heat up the sky and the 
battery to discharge). Now that we have higher-tech charge 
controllers, we are no longer using these blocking diodes. Ten 
years ago NABCEP would have a blocking diode question 
on their “Entry Level Exam” that compared a blocking diode 
to a one-way plumbing “check valve.” In a way a solar cell is 
a diode, preferentially sending electrons to the N-side of the 
P-N junction. It can be referred to as a photo-diode.
Another more recent NABCEP Associate exam question 
is rumored to ask about blocking, and in that case, they mean 
attaching a block of wood between rafters which is used to 
attach a lag bolt to, which is roofing and not electrical.
Another interesting fact about this PV cell being a diode, it 
is actually a light emitting diode (LED) in reverse, where you 
put in light and get electricity. A solar cell still is an LED when 
you put electricity into it, you get light, which is just invisible 
infrared light, also known as heat. This effect can be used for 
diagnosis of PV arrays using infrared imaging devices. If the 
solar cell has a problem and current is backfeeding through 
it, it will show up as hot!690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 59
690.9(C) PV System DC Circuits
When an overcurrent device is required, a single overcurrent pro￾tective device is permitted for each PV dc circuit. This protected 
circuit includes the PV, dc-to-dc converters, and the conductors in 
these circuits.
When single overcurrent protection devices are used, they must 
all be in the same polarity.
Discussion: In the 2014 and earlier versions of the NEC, 690.35 
required ungrounded systems to have overcurrent protection on 
both positive and negative polarities. The “transformerless” or 
“non-isolated” inverters that are the typical interactive inverter 
used today, were often called “ungrounded” inverters. Now the 
NEC only requires overcurrent protection on a single polarity when 
overcurrent protection is required. In places that have not yet 
adopted the 2017 NEC or later, fuses on both positive and negative 
polarities may be required, whenever fusing is required on PV dc 
circuits. NYC and Indiana adopt the NEC much later than most 
places. Fusing is usually required when there are greater than two 
circuits combined. Additionally, the new “690.8(A)(2) Circuits 
Connected to the Input of Electronic Power Converters” in the 
2020 NEC also requires overcurrent protection. 690.8(A)(2) would 
not typically be invoked without a high PV to inverter ratio.
One of the reasons that we are allowing overcurrent protection on 
only one polarity of a new inverter, is that when an old, “formerly 
known as grounded inverter” needs to be replaced, we can replace 
it with a new inverter without adding fuses. The newer inverters 
are much safer and more able to detect ground faults. It would be 
stupid to incentivize people to replace old less-safe inverters with 
other less-safe inverters, because they did not want to go through the 
complicated and expensive process of adding fuses. We can also now 
use USE-2 wire in this case rather than PV wire for the same reason.
690.9(C) Informational Note: OCPD only in positive or negative
Due to improved ground fault protection requirements, a single 
overcurrent protection device in either positive or negative polarity 
in combination with ground-fault protection provides adequate 
overcurrent protection. (Like we said.)60 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
690.9(D) Transformers
Overcurrent protection for transformers shall be installed 
in accordance with 705.30(F) Transformers (under 705.30 
Overcurrent Protection). 705.30(F) tells us that we consider the 
side of the transformer towards the greater fault currents as the 
primary, so for a utility-connected inverter connected through 
a transformer, the utility is the primary side, and the inverter is 
the secondary side of the transformer. 705.30(F) also says that 
the secondary conductors shall be protected in accordance with 
240.21(C) Transformer Secondary Conductors (Article 240 is 
Overcurrent Protection). This is essentially telling us when we 
do not need overcurrent protection on the secondary side of the 
transformer.
Discussion: 240.21(C) also sends us to 450.3. Section 450.3 has 
different values that overcurrent protection is based on, which are 
often more than 125% of current.
Article 450 is Transformers and Transformer Vaults and 
Section 450.3 is for Overcurrent Protection for transformers (not 
conductors).
690.9(D) Exception: Side of Transformer towards Inverter
If the current rating of the interactive inverter side of the trans￾former is at least the current rating of the inverter, then overcurrent 
on the inverter side of the transformer is not required.
Discussion: If the transformer can handle all of the current 
from the inverter, then overcurrent protection is not required 
between the inverter and the transformer.
This is due to the current-limited characteristics of the inverter not 
being able to hurt the transformer or overcurrent the conductors 
connected between the inverter and the transformer.
Usually, when an inverter is connected to a transformer, there 
is no requirement for overcurrent protection on the current￾limited inverter side of the transformer. The dangerous currents 
come from the big dangerous utility, not the safe PV side. When 
someone specifies a transformer for an inverter, they are not 
going to use a transformer that cannot handle all of the inverter 
current.690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements 61
690.11 Arc-Fault Circuit Protection (dc)
PV systems 80V or greater between any two conductors shall be 
protected by a listed PV arc-fault circuit interrupter or equivalent.
690.11 Arc-Fault Circuit Protection Exception
PV dc circuits in MC cable, metal raceway, enclosed metal cable 
tray or buried can forgo dc arc-fault protection, if they comply 
with one of the following.
1. Circuits are not in or on buildings.
2. Circuits are on a building whose sole purpose is to support or 
contain PV system equipment (like a building onsite at a big 
beautiful solar farm).
Discussion: In previous versions of the Code, this exception was 
for what used to be called PV output circuits, which are circuits 
coming out of a dc combiner. Apparently now this exception can 
also apply to PV string circuits; however, it is nearly impossible to 
have the conductors coming out of the modules inside of metal, 
until you invent it and make millions.
See 691.10 Fire Mitigation on page 181 for exceptions for dc arc￾fault protection under engineering supervision for large (greater 
than 5 MWac) systems in Article 691 Large-Scale Photovoltaic 
(PV) Electric Supply Stations.
Discussion and History: 2011 NEC 690.11 only applies to 
circuits penetrating or on a building and was the first time 690.11 
appeared in the NEC. 2014 NEC 690.11 applies to all dc PV 
circuits, even large ground mounts. This was a problem for large 
central inverter PV systems that would require dc arc-fault protec￾tion for PV source circuits and PV output circuits.
Engineering dc arc-fault protection is close to impossible for 
large PV output circuits. Some would say that utility scale PV 
using large central inverters does not comply with the 2014 NEC, 
since there is no way to perform dc arc-fault protection on the PV 
output circuits.
2017 and 2020 NEC allows PV systems that are not on or in 
buildings to not have dc arc-fault protection on PV output circuits 62 690 PV Systems Part II Circuit Requirements
when those circuits are either buried or in metal. PV source circuits 
still require arc-fault detection if they are greater than 80V. This 
means combiner level dc arc-fault devices for PV source circuits 
are required in PV systems with combiners that cannot invoke 
Article 691 (over 5 MWac).
Part II of Article 690 is almost complete. The last section of 
Part II will be covered in the next chapter. 690.12 Rapid Shutdown 
is so exciting, we figured it deserved its own chapter.

3 Section 690.12 Rapid Shutdown
Section 690.12 Rapid Shutdown of PV Systems on Buildings is the 
hottest spot in PV education since it came out in the 2014 NEC. 
Chapter 3 of this book is dedicated to covering the evolution of 
690.12. Not only were there changes from the 2014 NEC to the 
2017 NEC to the 2020 NEC, there were even parts of the 2017 
NEC that did not take effect until 2019. Therefore 690.12 deserves 
its own chapter. We will also cover the labeling requirements that 
used to be in 690.56(C) but are now in 690.12.
Rapid Shutdown in Popular Culture
At the Solar Battle of the Bands in San Francisco in 2018, 
during the last San Francisco Intersolar Conference, there 
was a band that called themselves the “Rapid Shutdowns” 
and was sponsored by Luminalt. Bill had to inform the Rapid 
Shutdowns that he was really the one who had named their 
band, so they took him backstage and whatever happened 
next was fortunately not on social media.
Grid Alternatives North Atlantic in DC also had a kick￾ball team called the Rapid Shutdowns, and apparently, they 
sucked and had a great time! (Kickball is a big thing on the 
National Mall lawn, with many political interns kicking off 
bipartisan steam).64 690.12 Rapid Shutdown
Please contribute to more of this behavior and let us know 
so your child, team, band, CCA or small government can 
also be featured in the next issue of this book!
Overview
The rapid shutdown requirements of the NEC first appeared in the 
2014 NEC and have changed quite a bit since the original versions, 
mostly in the 2017 NEC. This evolution of the Code has a pur￾pose: to save firefighters’ lives. In addition to making houses with 
PV safer for firefighters, firefighters will be more inclined to save 
buildings that have PV on them. Having firefighters save buildings 
with PV on them has many benefits, including keeping insurance 
rates from going up for buildings sporting PV arrays. In talking 
to many firefighters, I find that many of them are less inclined to 
put out a fire on a building that has PV on it. It is up to us to edu￾cate the firefighters to look for the rapid shutdown sticker or other 
indications that the building has a PV system on it that cannot 
shock them once rapid shutdown has been initiated. We can also 
educate them on how to tell if rapid shutdown has been initiated, 
which much of the time means that there is no ac power from the 
grid connected to the inverter. Rapid shutdown only applies to PV 
systems on buildings!

it does not have to comply with 690.12.
Sometimes a large solar project will have a building that serves 
as an equipment enclosure, the only purpose of which is to house 
PV system equipment. Obviously, rapid shutdown requirements 
were not intended to require rapid shutdown on a large solar farm 
equipment enclosure.

Rapid shutdown is not required on carports, shade structures, 
solar trellises, or similar structures. The authors of this book 
believe that this was the case in earlier versions of the Code, but it 
is clearly spelled out here for the first time.
690.12(A) Controlled Conductors
The requirements for the controlled conductors shall be applied to 
the following:
690.12(A)(1) PV System Dc Circuits
690.12(A)(2) Inverter Output Circuits from Inverters within the 
Array Boundary66 690.12 Rapid Shutdown
Discussion: Controlled conductors are conductors that we can 
turn off or control with our rapid shutdown disconnect/initiation 
device.
Energy storage system and loads are not PV systems. We can 
confirm this from the figures and images in NEC 705.1 and in 
Chapter 9 of this book, beginning on page 190. The PV system 
disconnect is the boundary of the “PV system.” In the 2014 NEC, 
rapid shutdown requirements are applied to battery systems 
and stand-alone inverters directly related to the PV system. The 
2017, 2020, and 2023 NEC’s rapid shutdown requirements only 
apply to a PV system and not to energy storage systems. Some 
people would like to make rapid shutdown requirements apply 
to energy storage systems and anything that could be energized 
when the grid goes down—future Codes will decide. Some PV 
systems with rapid shutdown automatically de-energize when the 
grid goes down. As we will see in Article 706 and in Chapter 10
of this book, the energy storage disconnecting requirements are 
evolving.
690.12(A) Exception
PV circuits from arrays not attached to buildings that terminate on 
the building, and PV circuits that are installed in accordance with 
230.6 Conductors Considered Outside the Building do not have to 
comply with rapid shutdown.
Discussion: It used to be that if you had a ground mount and 
wanted to mount the inverter on a wall of a building, that the AHJ 
might require you to follow 690.12. Some people were being cre￾ative and mounting inverters 1 inch away from the building on 
strut. Now it is clear that you can mount the inverter on the wall 
and not have to comply with rapid shutdown.
690.12(B) Controlled Limits
We have different rules for inside vs. outside of the array boundary. 
The array boundary is 1 foot from the array.
We can see the Article 100 definition of array:
Array. A mechanically and electrically integrated grouping of 
modules with support structure, including any attached system 690.12 Rapid Shutdown 67
components such as inverter(s) or dc-to-dc converter(s) and 
attached associated wiring.
Discussion: The array boundary is usually going to be 1 foot 
from the edge of the PV, but if the rails, tracker, inverter, or 
concrete foundation stick out more than the PV, then the array 
boundary can be 1 foot from the edge of it. It is interesting that 
when array was moved out of Article 690 into Article 100, it does 
not indicate in the definition that it has to do with a PV system, 
but it does.
A 20-foot-long conductor that is run 6 inches from the edge of the 
array would qualify as inside the array boundary.
If you have two arrays that are 2 feet apart from each other 
and are running conductors between both arrays, your conductors 
would always be within an array boundary being 1 foot or less 
from an array.
We have different voltage limits within and outside of the array 
boundary, and the time to get within these limits after rapid shut￾down is initiated is always going to be within 30 seconds.
690.12 (B)(1) Outside the Array Boundary
Controlled conductors outside the array boundary, or more than 
3 feet from the point of entry inside a building, shall be limited to 
no more than 30V within 30 seconds of rapid shutdown initiation.
Voltage shall be measured between any two conductors and 
between any conductor and ground.
Discussion: First, we point out that besides having a limit of 1 
foot from the array, the NEC also gives us 3 feet from the point of 
entry inside the building to have controlled conductors, which can 
be more than 1 foot from the array boundary if inside a building.
The reason that we need at least 3 feet inside the building is 
to allow enough space to mount equipment inside an attic space 
or similar area that performs the shutdown function. The roof 
thickness can take up much of that distance. Most of the time, 
the shutdown devices will be on the roof. Building-integrated PV 
systems are one example where this 3-foot rule will be important. 
Additionally, firefighters will probably not be cutting dir￾ectly through the building under the PV while the PV system is 
energized.68 690.12 Rapid Shutdown
BIPV and Microinverters Tony Diaz Style
Tony Diaz installs BIPV (building-integrated PV) and puts 
microinverters under the ridge cap (ridge of the roof). This 
means that he would have greater than 30V and less than 80V 
going from the array 1.5 feet to the ridge to the roof. Since 
this could be interpreted as being inside of the building, per￾haps it is Code-compliant. The 1.5-foot pathway from the 
PV to the ridge is for firefighters to cut a hole and vent smoke 
out. This BIPV also has fewer solar cells, so he puts them in 
series before connecting them to a microinverter to get the 
equivalent of a 60- to 72-cell PV module.
Controlled conductors outside of the array boundary or within 3 
feet from the penetration of a building must be limited to
• 30V
• Within 30 seconds
Rapid Evolution 2014 NEC to the present
In the 2014 NEC, 690.12 first stated that controlled 
conductors shall be limited to no more than 30V and 240 
volt-amperes within 10 seconds. The 2014 NEC was changed 
by an amendment in the year 2016 from 10 seconds to 30 
seconds via a TIA (temporary interim amendment). One 
reason for this change was to allow product manufacturers 
to address grid support requirements that may require that 
the PV array stay on for up to 20 seconds during utility grid 
problems. It also allows more time for the capacitors on the 
dc side of the inverter to discharge in 30 seconds. The Fire 
Service also agreed that the danger to firefighters would not 
change significantly with the time increase.690.12 Rapid Shutdown 69
The 2014 NEC 240 volt-ampere requirement was also 
taken out of the Code, since it is nearly impossible to verify 
in the field and needs to be verified by the laboratories that 
certify the equipment used for Rapid Shutdown.
690.12(B)(2) Inside the Array Boundary
The PV system shall comply with one of the following:
690.12(B)(2)(1) UL 3741 Listed PV Hazard Control System 
(PVHCS)
690.12(B)(2)(2) 80V in 30 seconds (module level shutdown)
690.12(B)(2)(1) UL 3741 LISTED PV HAZARD CONTROL SYSTEM
The PVHCS UL Standard was finally released in December 2020 
and then it took time for products to be listed to this standard. At 
the time of the writing of this book, there are not many systems 
that are listed to UL 3741 and there is a system that is listed, which 
is a bit controversial. Rather than get people upset by pointing out 
controversial things, we will just tell you that if it is UL 3741 listed 
as a system, then that is what the Code is asking for; however, there 
may be AHJs that will not accept certain equipment, so be sure to 
use equipment that your AHJ will accept. Sean gets into the con￾troversial UL 3741 topics on his podcast. We expect the number 
of UL 3741 listed systems to increase by an order of magnitude 
before we release our 2026 NEC book.
UL 3741 listings are on a system level, so it can include 
requirements for using specific equipment such as racking systems, 
inverters, wiring methods, and even a particular brand of cable ties.
The UL 3741 PVHCS certification process is still in the early 
stages of application. If systems get certified that violate the 
basic safety concerns that are intended to be addressed by this 
complicated certification process, it is certain that loopholes 70 690.12 Rapid Shutdown
will be closed and products that took liberties with the certifi￾cation process will have their certification revoked. The 
worst possible outcome of the UL 3741 process would be for 
the Fire Service, whom the certification is intended to protect, 
to lose faith in the process and withdraw their support. 
Products such as mid-circuit interrupters, microinverters, 
or dc-to-dc converters that take up two or more modules in 
series are already available on the market.
690.12(B)(2)(2) 80V IN 30 SECONDS (A.K.A. MODULE LEVEL SHUTDOWN)
690.12(B)(2)(2) is often called module level shutdown, which 
was already very common with micro-inverters and dc-to-dc 
converters (a.k.a. power optimizers) before rapid shutdown was 
invented. These systems are not required to be listed as a UL 
3741 PVHCS.
Figure 3.1 AP system 4 module inverter.
Source: Courtesy AP Systems.690.12 Rapid Shutdown 71
The reason that 80V amounts to module level shutdown is 
because the maximum voltage of two 60- or 72-cell modules in 
series (temperature corrected) would be over 80V. It is uncommon 
to find a PV module for a building that would have a maximum 
voltage over 80V and one module under 40V. Even a rare 96-cell 
module will remain under 80V on a cold day in New Jersey. Some 
thin film modules are over 80V and may not be usable to meet this 
particular compliance option.
This 690.12(B)(2)(2) method is accomplished with electronics 
distributed throughout the array for the most part. However, this 
method can also be accomplished with parallel connections and 
special equipment that disconnect series-connected modules at the 
module level.
690.12(B)(2)(3) NO EXPOSED WIRING OR METAL—REMOVED IN THE 2023 NEC
We called this method the BIPV pathway, and this type of 
system may still be used if it is listed as a UL 3741 PVHCS. 
This method required no exposed metal parts and no exposed 
wiring, among other things. If there was no exposed metal to 
complete a circuit, the idea was that it would be more difficult 
to get shocked.
Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV)
The definition for BIPV was last seen as a definition in the 
2014 NEC. This removal of BIPV was not because of a con￾spiracy against BIPV, but because BIPV was not mentioned 
anywhere else in the NEC. The NEC is not supposed to have 
definitions that do not refer to anything else in the NEC. 
Microinverters were first mentioned in the NEC in the 2020 
NEC in 690.33(D)(3) Informational Note, where it remains 
and is nowhere else. Perhaps it is time for a microinverter 
definition.
2014 NEC BIPV definition:
Building-integrated photovoltaics. Photovoltaic cells, 
devices, modules or modular materials that are integrated 72 690.12 Rapid Shutdown
into the outer surface or structure of a building and serve 
as the outer protective surface of the building.
690.12(C) Initiation Device
An initiation device is required to initiate rapid shutdown where 
rapid shutdown is required within the limits and boundaries. 
When in the off position, the rapid shutdown initiation device shall 
indicate that rapid shutdown has been initiated. This means that 
off means that the PV system is off, and that rapid shutdown is 
activated.
For one- and two-family dwellings, at least one rapid shut￾down initiation device must be outside in a readily accessible 
location.
Following are the three methods used for rapid shutdown 
initiation:
690.12(C)(1) Service Disconnecting Means
The service disconnecting means (main breaker) can be the rapid 
shutdown initiation device. This is an easy option, plus it shuts 
everything else down with one switch. This could be the fastest 
way to turn off a building in an emergency, PV system and 
everything.
690.12(C)(2) PV System Disconnecting Means
The PV system disconnecting means (usually a circuit breaker 
or fused disconnect) can be a rapid shutdown initiation device. 
In many places in America, the main service disconnect is in the 
basement, and the supply side fused disconnect is the PV system 
disconnecting means and the rapid shutdown initiation device.
690.12(C)(3) Readily Accessible Switch
A readily accessible switch (often a special rapid shutdown switch 
or inverter disconnect) can be the rapid shutdown initiation device, 
shown in Figure 3.2 on next page.690.12 Rapid Shutdown 73
Discussion: Many rapid shutdown systems shut down whenever 
the utility shuts down. For systems with energy storage backup, 
there needs to be a way to initiate rapid shutdown independent 
of utility outages. Otherwise, the rapid shutdown function would 
negate the benefit of the backup power system. As more batteries 
go on the grid, we will see more systems require a rapid shutdown 
initiation device independent of just cutting ac power to the inter￾active inverter output circuit.
Finishing off 690.12(C):
Where multiple PV systems with rapid shutdown are installed 
on a single service, the initiation device(s) shall consist of no more 
than six switches or circuit breakers in a single enclosure or group 
of enclosures.
690.12(D) Buildings with Rapid Shutdown
690.12(D) is a labeling requirement that was moved from 690.56(C) 
and changed somewhat, most notably that the yellow color require￾ment was removed. Let’s start off by displaying the label and then 
discussing it. (Complete marking and labeling summary on pages 
154–170).
Figure 3.2 Rapid shutdown initiation switch.
Source: Courtesy Bentek Solar.74 690.12 Rapid Shutdown
The label above must be at each service equipment location or 
at an approved readily visible location and shall indicate the loca￾tion of the rapid shutdown initiation devices.
The label shall have a simple diagram of the roof and include the 
words in the diagram above. The letters must be CAPITALIZED 
and have a minimum height of 3/8". All text shall be legible and 
contrast the background. (Sorry, no illegible gang fonts.)
Rapid Shutdown Sign Color Evolution
In the 2017 NEC we had two colors for a similar looking sign, 
which were red and yellow. Red was more dangerous and was 
for what was often called array level shutdown, which would 
not reduce the voltage of the conductors within the array, so 
it had slightly different wording. The yellow (safer colored) 
sign said that it reduced shock hazard within the array. In 
the 2020 NEC, we only had the yellow sign, since we let what 
we called array level shutdown expire on January 1, 2019 (it 
had this expiration date in the 2017 NEC). Now in the 2023 
NEC the same wording and imaging as the yellow sign is 
used, however there is no color requirement, this way you 
can coordinate with the exterior decorator.
Figure 3.3 Informational Note Figure 690.12(D).690.12 Rapid Shutdown 75
Yellow is the American National Standards Association 
(ANSI) caution color and red is the ANSI danger color.
Probably easy to keep the sign mellow yellow in most 
cases, especially since I have been training firefighters to look 
for the yellow for safety.
At the time of the writing of this book, there is surprisingly 
a new UL 3741 listed low slope ballasted rooftop system that 
uses metal framed PV modules and can remain at 1000V 
after initiation of shutdown within the array. Perhaps red 
would be a good idea for this one.
690.12(D)(1) Buildings with More Than One Rapid Shutdown Type—
Moved from 690.56(C)(1)
If a building has more than one type of PV system with different 
rapid shutdown types or a PV system installed without rapid shut￾down and another system installed later with a rapid shutdown 
system, then we need a sign that will indicate the different rapid 
shutdown type scenarios and where the PV system will remain 
energized after rapid shutdown is initiated.
Figure 3.4 on the following page is an example of a sign to be 
used for a rectangular-shaped building with two different types of 
rapid shutdown arrays. In this example, the color scheme is:
• Red with white background: title box on top
• Yellow: 2020 NEC PV array, 80V or less
• Red: 2014 NEC PV array (over 80V)
• Dotted line: within energized
The details, including color schemes, are not part of the NEC, but 
good ideas.
Here is the exact NEC wording of the entirety of 690.12(D)(1):
For buildings that have PV systems with more than one rapid 
shutdown type or PV systems with no rapid shutdown, a detailed 
plan view diagram of the roof shall be provided showing each 
different PV system with a dotted line around areas that remain 
energized after rapid shutdown is initiated.76 690.12 Rapid Shutdown
Your building and PV systems will probably look different than 
the sign in the image, so this sign is customized to the installation. 
Your sign should plainly indicate to firefighters which areas of the 
roof will be energized after rapid shutdown is initiated. A dotted 
line shall be around areas that remain energized after the rapid shut￾down switch is operated.
690.12(D)(2) Rapid Shutdown Switch—Moved from 690.56(C)(2)
Within 3 feet of a rapid shutdown switch, there shall be a label 
with the following words:

Time to shut down this chapter and move on to 690 Part III!DOI: 10.4324/9781003189862-5
4 Article 690 Part III 
Disconnecting Means
Article 690 Part III includes two sections:
690.13 Photovoltaic System Disconnecting Means
690.15 Disconnecting Means for Isolating Photovoltaic Equipment
Let us first define disconnecting means in general with the Article 
100 Definition:
Disconnecting Means. A device, or group of devices, or other 
means by which the conductors of a circuit can be disconnected 
from their source of supply.
In this definition, we can have a variety of different devices or 
means that can disconnect sources from supply. Some of these 
devices are not required to be load-break rated devices or big expen￾sive load-break rated switches that can disconnect a service.
Here are a few examples of disconnecting means:
• Load-break rated dc disconnect
• PV inter-module connectors
• Non-load-break rated disconnect
• Finger-safe, tilt-out fuseholders
Even a light switch is a disconnecting means and, for that 
matter, even unscrewing a light bulb can be considered operating 
a disconnecting means, no matter how many licensed professional 
electrical engineers it takes.690 Part III Disconnecting Means 79
690.13 disconnects (discos) need to be load-break rated in all 
cases and disconnect the PV system. 690.15 disconnects can be 
non-load-break rated in many cases and isolate equipment, so that 
a qualified person can work on or replace the equipment. Every 
disconnect is an isolating device.

690.13 Photovoltaic System Disconnecting Means
Here we are not going to be using a light switch to disconnect an 
entire PV system; however, we do need to provide a way to dis￾connect the PV system from all other systems. The PV system 
disconnecting means will disconnect the PV system from every￾thing that is not a PV system, such as energy storage, loads, and 
the grid. This means that your PV cannot be connected to a battery 
after opening (off) the PV system disconnect.
690.13(A) Location
690.13(A) contains (A)(1) and (A)(2)
690.13(A)(1) Readily Accessible
Disconnecting means shall be installed in a readily accessible 
location.80 690 Part III Disconnecting Means
Article 100’s definition of “readily accessible”:
Accessible, Readily (Readily Accessible). Capable of being 
reached quickly for operation, renewal, or inspections without 
requiring those to whom ready access is requisite to take actions 
such as tools (other than keys) to climb over (or under to remove 
obstacles), or to resort to portable ladders and so forth.
Discussion: A readily accessible disconnecting means can be 
locked in a room or building but cannot require access with tools. 
This means that the PV system disconnecting means can be inside 
a building.
Think of the PV system disconnecting means as the last thing 
that separates the PV system from any other system.
Here are some examples of common PV system disconnecting 
means:
• Grid tied inverter backfeed breaker
• Dc interconnected (aka dc-coupled) stand-alone system dc dis￾connect between PV and battery or charge controller (inter￾active inverter in an ac-interconnected stand-alone system 
disconnecting means would be an ac disconnect).
• Breaker feeding panelboard that is used exclusively for PV 
inverters
NEC Informational Note 705.1 shown in Chapter 9 of this 
book, beginning on page 190, separates the PV system from 
other systems at the source disconnect. This is where we will have 
more discussion on ac-interconnected and dc-interconnected 
examples, which replace ac- and dc-coupling terms in the 2023 
NEC and identify system disconnects. These images were moved 
from the beginning of 690 to the beginning of 705 in the 2023 
NEC and modified.
The disconnecting means in the diagrams separate the different 
systems, such as PV, energy storage or other.
690.13(A)(2) Enclosure Doors and Covers
NEC wording: “Where a disconnecting means for circuits oper￾ating above 30 volts is readily accessible to unqualified persons, 690 Part III Disconnecting Means 81
an enclosure door or hinged cover that exposes energized parts 
when open shall have its door or cover locked or require a tool to 
be opened.”
Discussion: Some switches do not require a tool to access 
energized parts. This can be a problem with utility-required knife 
blade switches on homes. Kids can open these switches and easily 
get shocked—we call these Darwin awards when adults open these 
switches. This is why the Code says you need a screwdriver or other 
tool to get inside of the disconnect or panelboard where there are 
energized busbars or terminals. One method is to put a nut and 
bolt through a door hasp which requires tools to open the door.
690.13(B) Marking (marking and labeling summary pages 154–170)
There are two different labeling requirements here. First, the 
690.13(B) Marking requires a sign that says, “PV SYSTEM 
DISCONNECT” or equivalent. It is interesting to note that most 
label companies go with the “equivalent clause” and add words 
and make the sign say more words than required, such as “main 
photovoltaic system dc disconnect.” Perhaps label companies get 
paid per character, unlike the characters who wrote this book.
Other markings are required for some disconnecting means 
which do not completely de-energize on both sides of the switch 
when the switch is opened (off). The sign shall say the following or 
equivalent:
WARNING
ELECTRIC SHOCK HAZARD TERMINALS ON THE 
LINE AND LOAD SIDES MAY BE ENERGIZED IN THE 
OPEN POSITION
Interestingly, label makers do not use the equivalent used here for 
the “line and load” sign. If we may suggest: “Warning, this switch 
can have electricity on both sides when off.” This has fewer letters 
and is easier for non-electrician firefighters and installers to under￾stand. We could also put the time it takes after turning off before 
it is safe on the inverter side. This is usually anywhere from 30 
seconds to 5 minutes. We have never heard of anyone doing this.
The NEC does not require a particular color or letter size for 
the PV SYSTEM DISCONNECT sign or the LINE AND LOAD 82 690 Part III Disconnecting Means
ENERGIZED sign; usually this sign is in capital white letters on a 
contrasting background. However, 690.13(B) requires that signs or 
labels do comply with 110.21(B).
110.21(B) Field-Applied Hazard Markings Are Required by 
690.13(B)
110.21(B) Where caution, warning, or danger hazard 
markings such as labels or signs are required by the Code, 
the markings shall meet the following requirements:
110.21(B)(1) The marking shall be of sufficient durability 
to withstand the environment involved and warn of the 
hazards using effective words, colors, symbols or any 
combination thereof.
110.21(B)(1) Informational Notes (recommended but not 
required): ANSI (American National Standards Institute) 
ANSI Z535.2–2011 (R2017) and ANSI Z535.4-2011 
(R2017) are recommended.
According to this 48 Page American National Standard for 
Product Safety Signs and Labels, there are requirements for 
the design and use of safety signs and labels.
Here are some examples:
Danger = white triangle, red exclamation mark, red 
background
Figure 4.1 PV system disconnect sign.
Source: Sean White (all rights reserved—kidding).690 Part III Disconnecting Means 83
Warning = black triangle, orange exclamation mark
Caution = black triangle, yellow exclamation mark
Danger, Warning, or Caution = yellow triangle, black border 
and exclamation mark
Since our 690.13(B) sign has the word WARNING in it, we 
can say that according to ANSI, WARNING indicates:
a hazardous situation which, if not avoided, could 
result in death or serious injury
In addition, warning signs such as the “line and load” sign 
would have a black triangle with an orange exclamation 
mark if you follow the informational note.
When we have an inverter that has capacitors that discharge 
up to 30 seconds from initiation of shutdown to comply with 
rapid shutdown requirements, we still need the 690.13(B) LINE 
AND LOAD ENERGIZED sign because a switch cover can be 
opened immediately and be hazardous to an electrical worker who 
is unaware of the hazard. Some electricians can get their fingers 
inside a disconnect within 30 seconds. There is no stated minimum 
time; however, with an islanding interactive inverter, the ac side 
shutdown is faster than any human ever, so the sign is not needed 
on the ac side of an interactive inverter.
690.13(C) Maximum Number of Disconnects
Each PV system disconnecting means shall not consist of more than 
six switches mounted in a single enclosure or group of enclosures. 
It is uncommon to have more than one disconnect for a PV system. 
An example of where you might have several disconnects to make 
up a PV system disconnect is with dc interconnected (dc coupled) 
systems where more than one dc PV circuit is connected to a 
battery storage system. Remember that the NEC does not limit 
the number of PV systems that could be connected to a building 
[690.4(D) Multiple PV Systems, page 17].
A single PV system disconnecting means shall be permitted for 
the combined ac output of one or more inverters or ac modules 
in an interactive system. Examples of this may be a microinverter 84 690 Part III Disconnecting Means
circuit with 15 microinverters or an ac panel main breaker that can 
disconnect 150 microinverters.
Discussion: If a building has multiple sources of power, then 
we can have no more than six disconnects per source. This means 
a building that has 1 PV system and is connected to the utility can 
have 12 disconnects. If there were 2 PV systems, then we could 
have up to 6 × 3 = 18 of these disconnects.
If the PV system disconnect(s) were grouped together on one 
side of the building and the utility disconnect(s) were grouped 
together on the other side, that is not a problem. However, a 
directory is required at each location to inform about the other 
sources to the building. Recall that 690.4(D) and 705.10 requires 
a directory if there are PV system disconnects located in different 
locations.
690.13(D) Ratings
The PV system disconnecting means shall have ratings sufficient 
for the maximum circuit current, available fault current, and voltage
that is available at the terminals of the PV system disconnect.
Discussion: We do not just look at the trip rating of an 
overcurrent protection device. We also look at the maximum avail￾able current that can be interrupted. If we are performing source 
connections to a service (formerly supply-side connections, see 
705.11 page 196), we would be on the utility side of all overcurrent 
protection devices and the overcurrent protection would often 
need to have a higher ampere interrupting rating (a.k.a. kAIC, 
thousands of amperes interrupting capacity, available fault current)
than a load-side connected PV system would. This is one reason 
why service rated equipment is used for source connections to a 
service because it often has a higher available fault current rating. 
Service rated switches also have a means to connect the neutral to 
ground in the enclosure.
Overcurrent protection devices have a high-end ampere 
interrupting rating for fault currents and a low-end overload 
amp rating. Often the high-end current is overlooked or ignored, 
since usually we are focused on the overcurrent protection 
device protecting conductors with the overload amp rating. The 
overcurrent protection device also needs to protect itself. On your 
house, the main service disconnect may have a higher ampere 690 Part III Disconnecting Means 85
interrupting rating than the load breakers in the service panel, 
since it is the first line of defense for utility fault currents. Ampere 
interrupting ratings are often in the tens of thousands of amps.

690.13(E) Type of Disconnect
PV system disconnecting means shall:
• Simultaneously disconnect all non-solidly grounded conductors
• Be capable of being locked
• Be one of the following types of disconnects 690.13(E)(1) 
through (5):
690.13(E)(1) Manually operated switch or circuit breaker
690.13(E)(2) Connector as in 690.33(D)(1) or (D)(3) (see 
page 124)
690.13(E)(3) Pull-out switch (with required interrupt rating)
690.13(E)(4) Remote switch that is operated locally and opens 
when control power is cut
690.13(E)(5) Device listed or approved for intended operation
Discussion: Recall that a PV system disconnecting means is the 
borderline between the PV system and other wiring systems. This 
means that a dc disconnect in an interactive PV system is not a PV 
system disconnecting means. It is merely an equipment disconnect 
for the inverter. Since the interactive inverter is part of the PV 
system (only processes PV power), the PV system disconnect would 
be an ac disconnect for an interactive system.
PV system disconnects need to open all non-solidly grounded 
conductors simultaneously. A PV module connector is an example 
of a disconnect or isolating device that does not simultaneously 
disconnect all conductors. It could not be used as a PV system 
disconnect, but a module connector can be used as an isolation 
device [690.15].
690.13(E) Informational Note: “Circuit breakers marked “line” 
and “load” may not be suitable for backfeed or reverse current.
This informational note had a big change in the 2020 NEC. 
Before, in the 2017 NEC and earlier, it was a shall, where now 86 690 Part III Disconnecting Means
it is a may in an informational note. There is a big difference 
between “shall” and “may.” The 2017 “shall” means that there is 
no way you can backfeed something marked “line” and “load,” 
but “may” in this context means that there is a chance in the 2020 
and 2023 NEC that you may not be able to backfeed something 
marked “line” and “load.” Thermally operated circuit breakers 
and fuses cannot tell which way the power is flowing and are 
generally suitable for backfeed, even if they say line and load 
on them.
Many people are in jail right now, because they did not know 
the difference between “shall” and “may,” so be sure to read this 
book carefully and stay safe!

690.15 Disconnecting Means for Isolating Photovoltaic Equipment
First, let’s discuss the difference between 690.13 PV System 
Disconnecting Means and 690.15 Disconnecting Means for Isolating 
Photovoltaic Equipment.
690.13 PV System Disconnecting Means, which we just went 
over, applies to how to separate a PV system from what is not a 
PV system. You could also consider this the borderline between 
the NEC definition of a PV system and some other system or spe￾cial equipment covered outside of Article 690, such as loads in 
a panelboard, an energy storage system, or a dc coupled battery 
bank on a 10MW PV system.
690.15 Disconnecting Means for Isolating Photovoltaic Equipment
applies to the disconnection of equipment inside the depths of the 
PV system. Here we can have non-load-break rated equipment, 
and non-simultaneous circuit opening, as with module connectors and 
fuseholders. We also have equipment disconnecting means, which 
can be load-break rated and can simultaneously disconnect.
Although Article 690 does not have a definition for “isolating 
device” and perhaps it should, there is an Article 100 Definition for 
Isolating Switch, which can give us some clues. Article 100 is titled 
Definitions.
Switch, Isolating. A switch intended for isolating an electrical 
circuit from the source of power. It has no interrupting rating, 
and is intended to be operated only after the circuit has been 
opened by some other means.
The above definition relates to what is often called a non-load￾break disconnect, or even a connector on the back of a PV module.
To sum it up, PV equipment disconnecting means are always 
allowed to be load-break rated and other times not required to be 
load-break rated.
Another term for load-break rated that we may see on equipment 
is current interrupting.
Some inverters or charge controllers have multiple inputs with 
a single disconnect; this single disconnect with multiple inputs is 
acceptable.
The purpose of isolating devices is for the safe ability to work on 
equipment without being exposed to energized conductors, which 88 690 Part III Disconnecting Means
like Burning Man, may cause serious injury or death. Isolating 
devices are not intended to be operated in an emergency condition
since they require that the technician makes sure that the circuit 
being interrupted does not have current flowing. It is essentially a 
maintenance disconnect.
690.15 states that a disconnect as described in 690.15(A) (see 
below) shall be provided to disconnect the following equipment 
from all not-solidly grounded conductors:
• Ac PV modules
• Fuses
• Dc-to-dc converters
• Inverters
• Charge controllers
690.15(A) Type of Disconnecting Means
Disconnects to isolate solar equipment shall be one of the 
following types:
690.15(A)(1) In Accordance with 690.15(C)
690.15(C) is coming right up on page 92. There are four things 
here, and they are more the load-break rated types. 690.15(A)(1) is 
one way of doing things, and there are a few more following.
690.15(A)(2)
Isolating device, which is part of listed equipment where an inter￾lock or similar prevents the opening under load.
690.15(A)(3)
For circuits under 30A an isolating device in accordance with 
690.15(B), which is next.
Turning Off an Inverter with Your Phone
Many devices, such as inverters and PV modules, come with 
isolating devices or disconnecting means. It is also quite 690 Part III Disconnecting Means 89
possible that an inverter could be designed with the ability to 
turn off with the use of a smartphone app. In this case, the 
smartphone could be used to turn off the inverter and then 
the connections to the inverter could be unplugged (isolating 
device) to remove or service the inverter.
690.15(B) Isolating Device
Isolating devices are not required to have an interrupting rating. If 
the isolating device is not rated for interrupting the circuit current, 
then it shall be marked with one of the following:
• Do Not Disconnect Under Load
• Not for Current Interrupting (this phrase is made up of fewer 
characters and saves label ink)
An isolating device is not required to simultaneously disconnect 
all current-carrying conductors of a circuit.
For example, if someone is removing or installing a PV module, 
they will not disconnect or connect positive and negative at exactly 
the same instant. If they were that quick, they would be making 
millions playing baseball.
Discussion: PV systems are current-limited, and the equipment 
of a PV system will have short-circuit currents available that are 
not much more than operating currents. We have to be sure that 
the terminals of the equipment side of the disconnect can handle 
these short-circuit currents.
It is the PV system disconnecting means covered by 690.13 that 
must have the ability to interrupt higher fault currents coming 
from batteries and the utility, which are outside of the PV system.
Equipment disconnecting means have to be able to open circuits 
that have current flowing through them and can be used as an iso￾lating device.
Isolating devices are not required to interrupt current. Isolating 
devices not rated for current interrupting should not be opened 
when there is current flowing. If they were opened under load, it 
could catch fire in rare circumstances, such as in an Article 691 
compliant solar farm with no dc arc-fault protection or an old PV 
system that is pre-2011 NEC without dc arc-fault protection.90 690 Part III Disconnecting Means
690.15(B)(1) through (4)
Following are the only types of isolating devices we can use.
690.15(B)(1) Connector Meeting the Requirements of 690.33
Must be listed and identified for use with specific equipment. The 
primary purpose for this statement was to make it clear that a con￾nector could be used as a disconnect when the application is clearly 
defined. For instance, consider an MC4 connector that is rated up 
to 50A and can be installed on circuits up to 1000Vdc. However, 
on a 1000Vdc series string, if you were to take it apart under even 
a 5A load, it could start a fire. Take that same connector and put 
it on the input of a lower dc voltage microinverter and that same 
connector can easily break the 5A load without damage to the 
connector or the operator.
Examples are:
• PV module connectors, such as an MC4 or Amphenol connector
• Dc-to-dc converter connector
• Some inverters come with ac cable connectors (more often in 
other countries)
690.33 Connectors are covered on page 123 of this book.
690.15(B)(2) Finger-Safe Fuseholder
Finger-safe fuseholders are most often used in combiner boxes.
Discussion: When doing voltage or IV curve testing on strings 
of modules at a dc combiner, we often open the finger-safe 
fuseholders to isolate the circuit. This should only be done after 
the PV dc combiner disconnect is opened and there is no current 
going through the circuit. Many solar installers have witnessed 
an arc show when opening touch-safe fuseholders under load on 
a system without dc arc-fault protection. Bill always carries a dc 
clamp ammeter to check for current before opening non-load￾break isolating devices.
As we can see in Figure 4.2 on the next page, the finger-safe 
fuseholder can be opened without touching the fuse. After the 
fuseholder is opened, both sides of the fuse are de-energized.690 Part III Disconnecting Means 91
690.15(B)(3) Isolating Device Requiring Tool to Turn Off
For isolating devices that are accessible to non-qualified personnel, 
these switches require the use of a tool to move the switch to the 
open position so that it is impossible for someone without the tool 
to walk by and open the switch under load. Opening one of these 
switches under load could be extremely dangerous to the operator. 
Laypeople usually think that turning something off is safe, but 
when you turn off a non-load-break rated switch under load, it is 
not safe. This is kind of the opposite of Lockout Tagout (Lockout 
Tag-on). Here we want to keep the isolating device on instead of 
off when under load to prevent arcs.
690.15(B)(4) Isolating Device Listed for Application
This option is a catch-all that allows products that have been tested 
and evaluated for a specific purpose to be used according to how 
they were evaluated. It may be a combination of several of the 
Figure 4.2 Finger-safe fuseholder.

options above but configured in a special way that makes it easier 
to work on the equipment.
690.15(C) Equipment Disconnecting Means
PV equipment disconnecting means shall comply with 690.15(C)
(1) to (4)
690.15(C)(1)
Have rating for:
• Maximum circuit current
• Available fault current
• Voltage

Will simultaneously open current-carrying conductors that are not 
solidly grounded
690.15(C)(3)
• Externally operable
• Will not expose operator to contact with energized parts
• Shall indicate if on or off (you can see that it is on or off)
• If not within sight, or within 10 ft, of disconnecting means or 
remote operating device shall be capable of being locked in 
accordance with 110.25 Lockable Disconnecting Means (cap￾able of being locked with or without lock installed).
690.15(C)(4)
Be one of the disconnect types in 690.13(E)(1) through (E)(5) 
Type of Disconnect, page 85 (switch, breaker, connector, pull-out 
switch, remote or listed device)
Discussion: It is an important distinction to note that, in the 
2017 NEC and later, we are required to open all not-solidly 690 Part III Disconnecting Means 93
grounded conductors. Inverters that were previously called 
grounded inverters in the 2014 NEC that were fuse grounded 
and were the typical US inverter of the 2000s decade are now 
called grounded functionally and are not solidly grounded. 
These formerly “grounded” inverters will have their for￾merly “grounded conductor” opened in the disconnect in the 
2017 NEC and later. Not disconnecting this former “white 
wire” that was referenced to ground through a fuse was a 
requirement of the 2014 NEC and the opposite is true in 
the 2017 NEC and later. Most large MW scale inverters are 
still “fuse grounded” (formerly known as grounded) and on 
new installations both polarities of the disconnect must be 
opened.
690.15(C) Equipment Disconnecting Means—continued
• If load terminals can be energized in the open (off) position, 
then the 690.13(B) “line and load energized sign” shall be used 
unless 690.33 connectors are used.
• Connectors between modules and from modules to other 
equipment are equipment disconnecting means. Fortunately, 
we do not need the “line and load energized” label at every solar 
module.
2014 NEC and Earlier vs. 2023 NEC (2017 and Later) NEC 
Inverter/Array Grounding
Comparing NEC requirements for formerly known as 
“grounded” (fuse grounded) inverters:
≤ 2014 NEC
• White grounded conductor
• Opened only single ungrounded conductor per circuit
• Fuses when required only on ungrounded conductor94 690 Part III Disconnecting Means
≥ 2017 NEC
• Positive and negative must not be white unless one is 
solidly grounded
• Both positive and negative must be opened at 
disconnect
• Fuses only required on one polarity (positive or 
negative)
While we are at it, we might as well give the 2023 NEC 
(2017 and later) and 2014 NEC (and earlier) differences of 
the formerly known as ungrounded, transformerless, or non￾isolated inverters, which are also now known as functionally 
grounded inverters and have the same rules as all other inter￾active inverters in the 2023 NEC.
Formerly known as “ungrounded” inverters:
≤ 2014 NEC
• Positive and negative must not be white
• Both positive and negative opened at disconnect
• Fuses required on positive and negative when fuses 
required
• Must use PV wire, no USE-2 wire for PV circuits out￾side of conduit
≥ 2017 NEC
• Positive and negative must not be white
• Both positive and negative opened at disconnect
• Fuses only required on one polarity (positive or negative)
• USE-2 or PV wire both acceptable for PV circuits out￾side of conduit
(Note that after the 2020 NEC USE-2 wire has to be dual 
listed as RHW-2 for this application.)
Now that we know about functionally grounded inverters, 
perhaps we can say that the 2014 and earlier versions of the 
Code were instigating dysfunctional grounding.690 Part III Disconnecting Means 95
690.15(C) Equipment Disconnecting Means Informational Note
For PV dc disconnects, it is common to put the line side towards 
the PV. This is more likely to de-energize the load side terminals, 
blades, and fuses when the disconnect is open.
In addition to the information in this informational note, with a 
utility interactive system, if you look at the dc and ac disconnects, it is 
always going to be the inverter side that is safer, so a good idea is to put 
the line side of the disconnect or other equipment towards the more 
dangerous side and the load side of the ac or dc disconnect towards the 
interactive inverter. Think of interactive inverters being smart.
690.15(D) Location and Control
The following are acceptable locations for isolating devices or 
equipment disconnecting means (at least one of the following shall 
apply):
690.15(D)(1) Within equipment.
690.15(D)(2) Readily accessible from equipment, within sight and
within 10 feet of equipment.
690.15(D)(3) Lockable in accordance with 110.25 Lockable 
Disconnecting Means (capable of being locked with or without 
lock installed).
690.15(D)(4) Remote controls which comply with one of the 
following a. or b.
690.15(D)(4)(a) Disconnect and controls within same equipment.
690.15(D)(4)(b) Disconnect is lockable in accordance with 
110.25 Lockable Disconnecting Means (capable of being 
locked with or without lock installed). Plus the location of 
controls are marked on disconnect.
End-of-Chapter Breakdown
Let us break down the different types of disconnecting means as 
related to PV systems and Article 690 Part III of the NEC.
• Disconnecting means
• Device(s) that disconnect conductors from supply
• The three below are all disconnecting means:96 690 Part III Disconnecting Means
(1) PV system disconnecting means
• Separates PV system from not a PV system
(2) Isolating device
• Non-load-break rated (load-break rated not required)
(3) PV equipment disconnecting means
• Load-break rated
In other countries that do not abide by the super-safe NEC, it is 
common for the only load-break rated disconnect in an interactive 
PV system to be a backfed circuit breaker in a load center. The rest 
of the system is connected together with connectors so we can say 
it is “connectorized.” These systems are turned off by the backfed 
breaker and then taken apart while not under load. It appears that 
the cowboys have gone foreign.
It has been said (although not yet in the NEC) that a well￾trained firefighter with baseball experience wielding a fiberglass￾handled axe is an exceptional disconnecting means. DOI: 10.4324/9781003189862-6
5 Article 690 Part IV Wiring 
Methods and Materials
Article 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials covers the 
methods and materials specific to wiring PV systems. Much of 
this material refers to and works with other articles of the NEC, 
especially the NEC articles within Chapter 3 Wiring Methods and 
Materials, such as Article 310 Conductors for General Wiring.
Chapters 5–7 Modify the First Four Chapters of the NEC
This means that if there is a difference between regular wiring 
methods and Article 690, when we are dealing with a PV 
system, we will go with Article 690. Same would also go for 
Articles in Chapter 7, such as 706 Energy Storage Systems, 
which modifies the first four chapters, including Article 480 
Storage Batteries. If Article 690 does not tell us to do some￾thing special, then we use the methods found in Chapters 1–
4. For example, with ac inverter circuits inside of a house, 
we can use NMC cable (Romex) and for PV dc circuits on 
a rooftop, we can use PVC, since the requirements to be in 
metal are for PV dc circuits inside a building.
Although there are PV-specific wiring methods in 690 Part IV 
Wiring Methods, all other parts of the 2023 NEC apply to the 
wiring of PV systems.98 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials

690.31 Wiring Methods
It is amusing when we see 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and 
Materials / 690.31 Wiring Methods / 690.31(A) Wiring Systems. 
We see a lot of repetition that emphasizes the importance of our 
wiring method and materials systems!
690.31(A) Wiring Systems
690.31(A)(1) Serviceability
Sufficient length of cable shall be provided in enclosures for 
replacement.
Discussion: Since your inverters and equipment will likely be 
replaced at some point, we need to make it easy for that future 
person, who may be your future self (with a different set of atoms).
300.14 Length of free conductors at outlets, junctions and 
switch points says that we need 6 inches of free conductor. 
It also says that, for boxes measuring fewer than 8 inches in 
any dimension, we only need the wire to be able to extend 
3 inches outside an opening. Additionally, if the wires are 
not spliced in the box, then this requirement does not apply.
690.31(A)(2) Where Readily Accessible
PV dc circuits over 30V in readily accessible locations shall be one 
of the following:
(1) Guarded
(2) In MC cable (Article 330 Metal-Clad Cable: Type MC)
(3) In raceway (does not require metal raceway here; however, 
requirement for being in metal is for dc circuits inside of 
buildings. See 690.31(D)(1) on page 119).690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials 101
690.31(A)(3) Conductor Ampacity
Table 690.31(A)(3)(1) shall be used for correcting ambient 
temperatures over 30°C for conductors with 105°C and 125°C 
rated insulation. The temperature rating of the insulation is the￾oretically how hot the wire can get after running the current in the 
ampacity table through it under given conditions. At this point, 
nobody is using 105°C and 125°C wire; however, Bill put this in the 
NEC, since he is an NEC futurist and copper cost reductionist. For 
proper wire sizing, see Chapter 12 Wire Sizing. Table 690.31(A)(3)
(1) is essentially an extension of Table 310.16, but with higher tem￾perature rated conductors.
Table 690.31(A)(3)(1) in the 2023 NEC was Table 690.31(A)(a) 
in the 2020 NEC and 690.31(A) in the 2017 NEC. In the 2017 
NEC, the temperature rating of the wires included temperatures 
covered in the 310 Tables. In the 2020 and 2023 NEC, this table 
covers 105°C and 125°C insulation temperatures only, which are 
very hot! Perhaps we are preparing for a Venus-like climate (this is 
not a political statement).
Table 310.15(B)(2)(a) Ambient temperature correction 
factors based on 30°C in the 2017 NEC was renamed 
Table 310.15(B)(1) in the 2020 NEC and then 310.15(B)(1)
(1) in the 2023 NEC. The 310 Tables have been seeing a lot of 
name changes lately, but the content remains the same. See 
page 275 for details. Perhaps that Code Making Panel wants 
more attention.
690.31(A)(3) Continued
Table 690.31(A)(3)(2) shall be used for determining ampacities of 
conductors rated for 105°C and 125°C. This table can be viewed 
as an extension of the table now known as Table 310.16. [From 
the 2011 to the 2017 NEC this table was temporarily named 
310.15(B)(16).]
Although conductors with a higher temperature rating can 
carry more current, they will still have the same voltage drop as 
conductors with a lower temperature rating. Since PV prices are 
getting so low, at this rate, they will pay us to take it in a few more 102 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials
Code cycles, so why not save money on smaller wire? If you do not 
see Bill’s name on the next edition of this book, it means the copper 
industry has taken him out for reducing the amount of copper 
required in a PV system. Sean hears the OCPD manufacturers also 
have put out a hit on him.
690.31(A)(4) Special Equipment
Wiring methods listed for PV systems may be used, in addition to 
wiring methods in the Code.
Permitted Wiring Methods
• Raceway wiring methods in the NEC
• Cable wiring methods in the NEC
• Other wiring systems specifically listed for PV arrays
• Wiring that is part of a listed system
The following are comments on different wiring systems:
• Raceway wiring methods in the NEC
• Raceway wiring methods are found primarily 
throughout Chapter 3 of the NEC. Chapter 3 is titled 
Wiring Methods and Materials.

• EMT is often the raceway method of choice 
and is covered in Article 358 Electrical Metallic 
Tubing: Type EMT.
• Cable wiring methods in the NEC
• Cable wiring methods are also found in Chapter 3 of 
the NEC.
• USE-2, a popular cable, is covered in Article 338, 
Service-Entrance Cable: Types SE and USE. The -2 of 
USE denotes that it is 90°C rated.
• PV wire is another wiring method that was specifically 
required in the 2014 NEC, but is an option along with 
USE-2/RHW-2 in the 2023 NEC.
• Other wiring systems specifically listed for PV arrays
• A cable manufacturer could design a cable that was 
superior to PV wire, get a certifying agency to list it, 
and now we have another cable listed for PV arrays.
• Wiring that is part of a listed system
• While this listed system could be a wiring system for 
rapid shutdown, it could be any special cable used as 
part of a listed system. The Enphase microinverter 
cable fits under this “listed system” category.

690.31(A)(4) INFORMATIONAL NOTE
See 110.14(C) Temperature Limitations under 110.14 Electrical 
Connections or see how to do this in Chapter 12 Wire Sizing of this 
book, which is easier to understand than the NEC (why we wrote it). 
Also explained on page 44.
690.31(B) Identification and Grouping
There was a little bit of rearranging here in the 2023 NEC, 
including turning things into lists.
690.31(B)(1) Conductors of Different Systems
Unless allowed in the important exceptions below or allowed in 
equipment listing, then PV circuits shall not occupy the same 
equipment wiring enclosure, cable, or raceway as other non-PV 
systems or inverter output circuits, unless separated by barrier or 
partition.
Partitions are available with some enclosure products such as 
gutters. Most jurisdictions will require a partition to be an accessory 
included in the listing of the enclosure.
690.31(B)(1) EXCEPTION (SOMETIMES THE EXCEPTION IS MORE COMMON 
THAN THE RULE)
If all conductors and cables have an insulation voltage rating that 
is at least that of the highest maximum circuit voltage [690.7(A) 
defines maximum circuit voltage], then the following 1, 2, & 3 shall 
be permitted:
690.31(B)(1)(1) Power limited circuits Multiconductor jacketed 
cables for remote control, signaling, or power limited circuits are 
permitted in the same enclosure/cable/raceway as PV dc circuits 
(assuming all circuits serve the PV system).
Discussion: Think of this as your data, rapid shutdown sig￾naling, and CT cables. You just need to make sure the insulation 
is rated for the higher voltage. 1500V CAT5 network cables are 
available by the way.
Example: If there is a 600V circuit and a 24V circuit in the same 
jacketed cable/raceway/enclosure, then the insulation around the 
24V circuit has to be rated for at least 600V.690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials 105
690.31(B)(1)(2) Inverter output circuits Inverter output circuits (ac) 
can occupy the same box or wireway as PV dc circuits, that are identi￾fied and grouped [which is required anyway according to 690.31(B)(2) 
Identification and 690.31(B)(3) Grouping and coming right up].
Discussion: Since identification and grouping is already 
required, then we almost do not need to mention grouping and 
identification.
690.31(B)(1)(3) Inverter output circuits and non-PV systems Dc 
circuits using multiconductor jacketed cable, MC cable, or listed 
wiring harnesses that are identified for the application and per￾mitted to occupy the same wiring method as inverter output 
circuits and non-PV systems.
Discussion: Here we can even combine non-PV circuits in the 
same wiring method, so as we said, the exception is more of a rule.
690.31(B) also tells us we need to comply with both 690.31(B)
(1) Identification and Grouping and 690.31(B)(2) Grouping.
690.31(B)(2) Identification
PV system dc circuit conductors shall be identified at accessible 
points of
• Termination
• Connection
• Splices
• Exception: If evident by spacing or arrangement, further iden￾tification not required
Means of identifying PV system circuit conductors:
• Color coding
• Marking tape
• Tagging (probably not spray-painted gang tagging)
• Other approved means in 690.31(B)(2)(a) and (b) coming right up.
690.31(B)(2)(A) OTHER APPROVED MEANS OF IDENTIFICATION
Using color for polarity identification shall be with a permanent 
method, such as106 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials
• Labeling
• Sleeving
• Shrink tubing
690.31(B)(2)(B) AND ONE OTHER APPROVED MEANS OF IDENTIFICATION
Non-solidly grounded positive conductors shall include either:
• Imprinted plus sign “+”
• The word POSITIVE or POS durably marked and not green, 
white, or gray
Non-solidly grounded negative conductors shall include either:
• Imprinted negative sign “–”
• The word NEGATIVE or NEG durably marked and not red, 
green, white, or gray
Note: only solidly grounded conductors shall be marked in 
accordance with 200.6 Means of Identifying Grounded Conductors, 
which is where you find the white wire for the neutral rule and 
alternatives, such as gray.
Discussion: Solidly grounded systems in the 2023 NEC (2017 
NEC and after) are rare systems that are not fuse grounded. An 
example of a solidly grounded PV system according to the 2023 
NEC is a direct PV well pump, where the negative conductor is 
solidly connected to a grounding system that includes a grounding 
electrode (often the well casing). Grounding through a fuse is not 
solidly grounding.
These rare and solidly grounded conductors will most likely be 
marked white according to 200.6 (the marking could be grey, three 
white stripes, or three grey stripes). Fuse-grounded current-carrying 
conductors that operate at zero volts to ground are not considered 
to be meeting the requirements of 200.6 and should not be identified 
as white, as they were in the 2014 NEC and earlier versions. The ac 
side of an inverter is most often solidly grounded, just like any￾thing else ac.
The 690.31(B)(2) Identification Exception tells us that if the 
identification of conductors is evident by spacing or arrangement, 
then we do not need other forms of identification.690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials 107
690.31(B)(3) Grouping
If the ac and dc conductors of PV systems occupy the same
• Junction box or
• Pull box or
• Wireway
then the ac and dc conductors of each system shall be grouped 
separately by cable ties or similar every 6 ft.
The 690.31(B)(3) Grouping Exception tells us that the grouping 
does not apply if the circuit enters from a cable or raceway that is 
unique and obvious.
(What is obvious to a qualified person is oblivious to someone 
who has not read this book.)
690.31(C) Cables
PV wire or cable and distributed generation (DG) cable shall be 
listed. The PV Wire listing is UL 4703 and DG cable is UL 3003.
UL listing numbers in this industry are related.
The UL listing for PV is UL 1703 (or 61730, see below). If 
you change the 03 to 41, then you have the inverter, charge 
controller, and dc-to-dc converter UL listing 1741. If you 
change the first 1 to a 3 in UL 1741, you get UL 3741, which 
is the rapid shutdown listing we call PV Hazard Control 
Systems (UL 3741 PVHCS). If you change the first digit in 
UL 1703 from a 1 to a 2, then you get the racking listing of 
UL 2703. If you change the first digit in UL 1703 from a 1 
to a 4, then you get the listing for PV wire, which is UL 4703. 
If you change the first digit in UL 1703 from a 1 to a 6, then 
you get the listing for PV connectors, which is UL 6703. For 
DG cable, you change the 17 in UL 1703 to a 30, then you get 
the listing for DG cable, which is UL 3003.
As of December 2020, there became a new PV UL 
listing in town, which is UL 61730, rather than UL 1703. 
This is because the listing was harmonized with the Euro/108 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials
international listing, so the PV manufacturers no longer have 
to do two separate tests for a globally used PV module. All 
they did was add a 6 to the beginning of 1703, which is appar￾ently some International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
thing; however, a 6 before UL 1703 was already taken by the 
IEC 61703 Mathematical Expression for Reliability (which 
is unrelated to PV), so the 0 and the 3 were transposed by 
some high paid transposing expert (numerologist), and now 
we have the well thought out UL 61730 listing. If something 
is listed as UL 1703 you can still use it, but products first 
made after 2020 will do the UL 61730 test.
690.31(C)(1) Single-Conductor Cable
Single conductor cable in exposed outdoor locations in PV dc circuits 
within PV array shall comply with 690.31(C)(1)(a), (b) and (c):
690.31(C)(1)(a) There are two wire types you can choose from:
690.31(C)(1)(a)(1) PV wire or cable (has non-standard diam￾eter, so if you are doing conduit fill calculations, you have to 
get the wire dimensions from the manufacturer).
690.31(C)(1)(a)(2) Dual listed as USE-2/RHW-2 (almost always 
USE-2 is dual listed as RHW-2)
Discussion: Dual listing USE-2/RHW-2 was new in the 2020 
NEC. Most USE-2 wire already is dual listed as RHW-2, so it 
would be more difficult to find USE-2 wire that was not also RHW￾2 wire. USE-2 wire on its own cannot go inside of conduit inside a 
building, but when it is dual listed it can go inside of buildings on the 
coattails of RHW-2. The RHW designation includes the building 
wire fire ratings required for conductors in buildings. PV wire also 
has this same fire designation and is usually also marked RHW-2.
690.31(C)(1)(b)
• 8 AWG and smaller shall be supported every 24".
• PV wire is permitted wherever RHW-2 is permitted (like in 
conduit).
• Exception for Article 691 Large-Scale PV Electric Supply 
Stations (see page 171) where you can do various things that 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials 109
conflict with 690 with an engineered design. 691.4 defines 
691 compliant, including requirement to be over 5MW 
ac. For these large PV systems, you can secure at intervals 
determined by the engineer(s).
Discussion: In the 2017 NEC and earlier there was no 24" 
requirement and we looked to 338.10(B)(4)(b) and 334.30, which 
let us support the conductors every 4.5 ft. Some installers would 
like to have the distance be at least the width of the module, which 
is usually about 40 inches.
690.31(C)(1)(c)
• Larger than 8 AWG shall be supported every 54".
• This is new in the 2023 NEC.
USE-2 and PV Wire
USE-2 cable and PV wire are the two most common wiring 
methods for connecting PV modules to each other and 
for connecting PV modules to anything else. These wiring 
methods are commonly installed under PV modules and do 
get exposed to sunlight. It is interesting that USE stands 
for Underground Service Entrance, and has been tested for 
exposure to sunlight. (Not usually much sunlight under￾ground unless you consider neutrinos sunlight.) The -2 suffix
is one way of indicating that something is 90°C rated.
In previous versions of the NEC, PV wire was specifically 
required for what was formerly known as “ungrounded” PV 
arrays in the 2014 NEC, but now there is no specific require￾ment to use PV wire. PV wire may be better than USE-2 wire 
and has been tested with more UV light, but USE-2 cable 
may be less expensive.
When the PV industry was originally trying to get the 
code-making panel to accept “ungrounded” inverters, they 
used similar wiring methods to systems with double insula￾tion in Europe. PV wire is often the wire of choice of PV 110 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials
module manufacturers since it is acceptable everywhere in 
the world and with every version of the NEC.
USE-2 cable, and PV wire, are often colored black and 
work better when colored black, since black is the color of 
carbon black, which is a pigment that helps with UV resist￾ance by preventing UV light from penetrating. This is also 
why black cable ties are more UV resistant (and why light 
skin can lead to deadly melanomas). When sourcing black 
cable ties, use Nylon 6 cable ties when contacting every￾thing except galvanized steel. Nylon 12 is necessary for any 
cable ties contacting galvanized steel. One last item for cable 
ties: the NEC and UL standards require that the cable ties be 
rated “Type 21C” where used for cable support. This Type 
21C designation will typically be printed on the package 
enclosing the ties.
There was a time when some inspectors did not read 200.6 
Means of Identifying Grounded Conductors and they believed 
that white USE-2 cable was required. (There are other ways 
of identification, such as marking.)
Some installers have used red USE-2 cable to indicate a 
positive conductor and as the red faded, people would see 
white, and think that the formerly red wire was a white 
grounded conductor.
Most, if not all PV wire is also marked RHW-2 since it has 
to pass all the same tests as RHW-2. This rating of RHW￾2 also allows the conductor to be installed inside buildings. 
USE-2 without the RHW-2 marking is not permitted, 
because it may not have been tested for the necessary fire and 
sunlight ratings.
690.31(C)(2) Cable Tray
There were some changes here, and some jumping around the 
NEC is required, such as jumping from Articles 690 to 392 Cable 
Trays and 310 Conductors for General Wiring. In previous versions 
of 690, what was missing was what to do about conductors smaller 
than 1/0 in cable trays and then some wise guy, Dave Click PE, 
pointed it out and caused us to make this book longer which 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials 111
comes down to killing trees in the name of saving the planet. Dave 
is a proofreader of this book, so if there are any mistakes, they are 
all his fault.
Not changed in the 2023 NEC were the following requirements:
• Support cables every 12".
• Secure the cables every 54".
• PV wire, PV cable or DG cable without cable tray rating can go 
in cable tray outdoors.
Now for the new rules which apply to single-conductor PV wire 
smaller than 1/0:
• In uncovered cable trays the adjustment factors for 1/0 in 
392.80(A)(2) are used:
○ Article 392 Cable Trays
○ 392.80 Ampacity of conductors
○ 392.80(A) Ampacity of Cables, Rated 2000V or Less, in 
Cable Trays
○ 392.80(A)(2) Single-Conductor Cables
• 392.80(A)(2) starts out not being specific to 1/0 and larger. It 
does tell us some important things that we should do when 
using cable trays, such as:
○ Obey 310.14(A)(2) Selection of Ampacity, which is where 
we select the lowest ampacity in a circuit, unless that lower 
ampacity is 10' or 10% of the circuit length, whatever is 
less. This is a common wire sizing rule, that you should be 
familiar with. See page 275.
○ Do not obey 310.15(C)(1) More than 3 Current Carrying 
Conductors, which are the familiar adjustment factors for 
greater than 3 current carrying conductors, which any wire 
sizing geek knows inside out. (Page 276.)
○ Then 392.80(A)(2) tells us that for our single conductor 
cables, or when our cables are cabled together (such as 
quadruplexed), we then need to follow a through d.
○ 392.80(A)(2)(a) is for huge 600 kcmil and larger cables and we 
are told to use 70% of ampacities in Tables 310.17 and 310.19.
○ 392.80(A)(2)(b) is for 1/0 through 500kcmil and this is what 
690.31(C)(2) is referring to and what we are mostly looking 
for, since we are supposed to use what 392.80(A)(2)(b) says 112 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials
for 1/0 cables, for cables smaller than 1/0. (Note that (c) and 
(d) following also apply to 1/0). Now what it says here are 
two different things.
• Use 65% of ampacities in Tables 310.17 and 310.19.
• Use 60% if the cable trays are continuously covered and 
covers unventilated for 6' or more.
Tables 310.17 and 310.19
What we are mostly familiar with is Table 310.17 Ampacities 
of Single-Insulated Conductors in Free Air which is based on 
30°C ambient temperature, and then using table 310.15(B)(1)
(1) Ambient Temperature Correction Factors Based on 30°C 
to correct for hotter temperatures. The NEC does have tables 
based on 40°C, such as 310.19 Ampacities of Single-Insulated 
Conductors in Free Air which is based on 40°C. I have always 
been taught to ignore ampacity tables based on 40°C. I recall 
someone on the Mike Holt team crossing out the page for 
a 40°C ampacity table. We like to treat our NEC books as 
sacred and do not put marks on them.
So just use 310.17 for cable trays and use a special cable tray 
derating factor, which is probably going to be 65% or 60%.
• 392.80(A)(2)(c) is for 1/0 and larger, so we use it for smaller 
than 1/0 for PV. When single conductors are installed in cable 
tray with spaces between the cables that are at least one cable 
diameter. There are no derating factors here, so you get 100%!
• 392.80(A)(2)(d) is for 1/0 and larger, so we use it for smaller than 
1/0 for PV in these cases. If single conductors are installed in tri￾angular or square configuration, with a free air space between 
them of at least 2.15 times the conductor diameter of the largest 
conductor, then there is no derating factor, so 100%, just like we 
scored on our NABCEP exams!
Now back from our detour to Articles 392 and 310 and to 
690.31(C)(2) where it says:690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials 113
Where single-conductor PV wire smaller than 1/0 AWG is 
installed in ladder ventilated trough cable trays, the following 
(three) shall apply.
690.31(C)(2)(1) Single conductors installed in 1 layer
690.31(C)(2)(2) Conductors bound in circuit pairs can be installed 
in other than a single layer
690.31(C)(2)(3) Sum of diameters of conductors shall not exceed 
cable tray width
Figure 5.1 also relates to Chapter 9 Table 1 Percent of Cross 
Section of Conduit and Tubing for Conductors and Cables. It is 
all about geometry and where you can fit the circles.
Summing up 690.31(C)(2) Cable Trays:
1. We support our cables every 12" and secure them every 54" 
(or less).
2. Instead of using Table 310.15(C)(1) Adjustment Factors for 
More than 3 Current Carrying Conductors when using cable 
trays, we find other rules and adjustment factors, such as 
a 65%, 60% or 100% (no) factor in Article 392 Cable Trays, 
depending on the cooling effects of spacing and air flow.
Figure 5.1 Conductors in different configurations.

PV Wire or Cable and DG Cable Diameter
If you are looking for the diameter of your PV wire, take 
note that:
PV and DG Wire/Cable has a non-standard diameter (it 
can vary from one manufacturer to the next), so we cannot 
use Annex C and we have to get the wire diameter from the 
manufacturer and use that along with Chapter 9 Tables 1, 
4 and 5 for determining how many wires fit in conduit.
PV and the NEC Informational Note:
This quote above was an informational note in 2020 NEC 
690.31(C)(2), which disappeared in the 2023 NEC, but still is 
good enough information for this book, which is really just 
one big and exciting 300 page informational note.
690.31(C)(3) Multiconductor Jacketed Cables
Although not defined in the NEC, a multiconductor jacketed 
cable is simply a cable with multiple conductors in it that 
also has a jacket around the cable. A common example of a 
multiconductor jacketed cable would be that yellow or white 
NMC cable (a.k.a. Romex) in the studs of your walls. You can 
also have DG cable and service entrance cables that fit this def￾inition, or even your ethernet cable going to a router or energy 
storage system.
If said cables are part of a listed assembly, then install them 
according to the instructions. You always follow instructions for 
listed equipment because that is how it was tested to be safe. Also, 
if something bad happens in the system and instructions are not 
followed, the lawyers will make a lot of money.
A microinverter cable is an example of this kind of cable that is 
part of a listed system.
If the cables are not part of a listed assembly, then you can still 
install these multiconductor jacketed cables in accordance with the 
cable’s listing and in accordance with the following (1) through 
(2) a to f.690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials 115
• 690.31(C)(3)(1) If on or in buildings then in raceway
• 690.31(C)(3)(2) If not in raceways, then a to f
• 690.31(C)(3)(2)(a) Marked sunlight resistant if exposed 
outdoors
• 690.31(C)(3)(2)(b) Protected or guarded when exposed 
to damage
• 690.31(C)(3)(2)(c) Closely follow the surface or support structure
• 690.31(C)(3)(2)(d) Secured no less than every 6 ft
• 690.31(C)(3)(2)(e) Secured no more than 24 inches from 
connectors or entering enclosures
• 690.31(C)(3)(2)(f) Marked direct burial if buried
To sum up multiconductor jacketed cables: If it is inside, it 
needs to be in a raceway and if it is outside, then it needs to be in 
a raceway or meet all six things above a through f, or according to 
instructions if part of a listed PV assembly.
690.31(C)(4) Flexible Cords and Cables Connected to Tracking 
PV Arrays
The following shall apply to flexible cords and cables connected to 
tracking PV arrays:
• Identified as hard service cord or portable power cable
• Suitable for extra-hard usage
• Listed for outdoor use
• Water resistant
• Sunlight resistant
• Stranded copper permitted to be connected to moving parts 
of tracking PV arrays in accordance with Table 690.31(C)(4)
(see below)

• Comply with Article 400 Flexible Cords and Cables
• Allowable ampacities in accordance with 400.5 Ampacities for 
Flexible Cords and Cables
Article 400 Flexible Cords and Flexible Cables Discussion: 
Article 400 contains different tables to be used for flexible cords 
and cables, which are used for stationary conductors, including 
various ampacity tables, much like the Article 310 tables, but more 
“flexible” (pun) in 400.5 Ampacities for Flexible Cords and Flexible 
Cables.
Table 690.31(C)(4) Minimum PV Wire Strands Discussion: 
Tracking arrays have moving parts that may bend wires back and 
forth 365 times per year, which can be 10,000 times or more in the 
life of a 30-year-old PV system. Wire with not enough strands will 
strain-harden and break.
Table 690.31(C)(4) Minimum PV Wire Strands does not have 
in its title that it is specific for tracking arrays and, if taken out 
of context, someone might think that it would apply with all PV 
wire or all PV system wiring. This table is only required for PV wire 
connected to moving parts of PV tracking arrays. For other types of 
wire connected to tracking systems, you would look in Article 400 
Flexible Cords and Cables, where PV wire is not covered.
The ampacities in 400.5 and Tables 400.5(A)(1) and 400.5(A)(2) 
differ from the ampacities typically used for conductors in free air in 
Table 310.17. These cables also have different ampacities depending 
on how many conductors are contained within the cable.
The ambient temperature correction factors in Table 310.15(B)
(1)(1) [formerly 310.15(B)(1) in 2020 NEC or 310.15(B)(2)(a) in 
2017 NEC] do apply.
It is interesting to note that Table 400.5(A)(3) Adjustment Factors 
for More than Three Current Carrying Conductors in a Flexible 
Cord or Flexible Cable is exactly the same as Table 310.15(C)
(1) Adjustment Factors for More Than Three Current Carrying 
Conductors. What a waste of ink! (Now we’re doing it too.)
690.31(C)(5) Flexible, Fine-Stranded Cables
Flexible, fine-stranded cables shall only be terminated with lugs, 
devices, or connectors in accordance with 110.14 Electrical 
Connections.690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials 117
110.14 Electrical Connections includes information on 
(A) Terminals, (B) Splices and (C) Temperature Limitations.
In 110.14(c) it says that conductors with temperature ratings 
higher than specified for terminations may be used for ampacity 
adjustment, correction, or both. This is something that is more of 
the complicated part of wire sizing. When you are correcting for 
ampacity with adjustment and correction factors, you do not take ter￾minal temperatures or the 125% continuous current correction factor 
into consideration. You do take the terminal temperature limits and 
the 125% required ampacity for continuous current into consider￾ation without the adjustment and correction factors. You can read 
more about wire sizing in Chapter 12 of this book beginning on 
page 287 to see how it is done in practice, and it is also covered 
somewhat when we discuss 690.8(B) beginning on page 41. Just 
because something is in the NEC and you have to do it, it does not 
always mean that it has to make sense. With some things, once you 
understand how it does not make sense, then you understand it.
Flexible, Fine-Stranded Cables, Formerly Known as 
690.31(H)
Although 690.31(H) was moved to the cable section as 
690.31(C)(5), the NEC already has provisions for using 
proper terminations for the application in 110.14 Electrical 
Connections, but we are reminded about it here since many 
installers tend to forget this part of the Code.
Flexible, fine-stranded cables shall be terminated only with 
terminals, lugs, devices, or connectors in accordance with 
110.14.
Flexible, fine-stranded cables are easy to bend, but are 
more difficult to terminate. Inexperienced installers in the 
past have used typical screw terminals that are not meant for 
flexible, fine-stranded cables. In these cases, the connection 
will often become loose, resistance will rise and heat will be 
generated, which can be a fire hazard.
PV installers in the past used batteries and liked to use 
flexible, fine-stranded cables, since they would not overstress 
battery terminals. Most battery cables now use fine-stranded 118 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials
cables with the proper terminations. Batteries are no longer 
part of a PV system as of the 2017 NEC.
PV arrays that track the sun do require flexible cables and 
installers of these cables should be aware of the requirements 
for using proper terminal procedures and equipment.
690.31(C)(6) Small Conductor Cables
16 American Wire Gauge (AWG) and 18 AWG single-conductor 
cables are permitted for module interconnections if they:
• Meet ampacity requirements of 400.5 Ampacities for Flexible 
Cords and Cables.
• Comply with correction and adjustment factors from Section 
310.14 Ampacities for Conductors Rated 0–2000 Volts.
• 310.14 does point to the famous tables used for wire sizing in 
310.15 among other things, such as 310.15(B)(1)(1) Ambient 
Temperature Correction Factors Based on 30°C and 310.15(C)
(1) Adjustment Factors for More than Three Current Carrying 
Conductors.
Note that 310.14 does not direct you to Tables 310.16 and 
310.17 and instead we use the ampacity tables in Article 400 for 
Flexible Cords and Cables, even though these small conductors are 
not necessarily rated as flexible cords or cables.
Discussion: It may have been unthinkable to use 16 AWG or 
18 AWG wire for PV systems when PV was more expensive; how￾ever, with the advent of falling prices, it is now thinkable and more 
likely in large projects using thin film modules with lower than 
typical crystalline silicon PV module current ratings. 310.10(A) 
Minimum Size of Conductors says that we cannot use any copper 
conductor smaller than 14 AWG unless stated elsewhere in the 
Code. 690.31(C)(6) is officially elsewhere in the Code.
Did you know that a MW at a MV is 1A?
690.31(D) Direct Current Circuits on or in Buildings
Wiring on or in buildings must comply with 690.31(D)(1) and 
690.31(D)(2) below.690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials 119
690.31(D)(1) Metal Raceways and Enclosures (PV dc circuits inside of 
buildings)
PV dc circuits inside a building that exceed 30V or 8A shall be 
inside of:
• Metal raceway (like EMT Article 358)
• MC cable (Article 330, Metal-Clad Cable: Type MC). We are 
also directed to 250.118(10)(b) or (c), which tells us how MC 
cable can be also used as an equipment grounding conductor:
• 250.118(10)(b) Combined metallic sheath and uninsulated 
grounding conductor of interlocked metal tape of MC cable 
that is listed and identified as equipment grounding con￾ductor (EGC).
• 250.118(10)(c) metallic sheath or combined metallic sheath 
and EGC of smooth corrugated tube-type MC cable that is 
listed and identified as EGC.
690.31(D)(1) Exception to Metal Raceways and Enclosures (PV dc 
circuits inside of buildings)
PV Hazard Control Systems (PVHCS) in accordance with 
690.12(B)(2)(1), (UL 3741 listed PVHCS, see page 69) shall be 
permitted to use non-metallic or use other than MC cables at the 
point of penetration of the building.
Things Removed in the 2020 NEC to Take Note Of
This “inside of metal” requirement used to be in the 2017 
NEC and earlier, and only applied up to the first readily 
accessible dc disconnect. This is no longer the case. Dc parts 
of a PV system in a building require metal even after the first 
dc disconnect, unless part of listed UL 3741 PVHCS.
Also, take note that the special requirements that were in 
the 2017 NEC regarding PV circuits embedded in building 
surfaces were removed in the 2020 NEC. Perhaps due to 
690.12, the roof is safer, and these requirements are no 
longer needed.120 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials
Removed in the 2023 NEC were requirements for PV dc 
circuits in buildings that were using flexible wiring methods, 
such as FMC and MC cable, that required protection, such 
as guard strips.
690.31(D)(2) Marking and Labeling
PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER SOURCE or SOLAR PV DC 
CIRCUIT
Unless located and arranged so the purpose is evident, this 
wording above shall be marked on the following wiring methods 
and enclosures that contain PV system dc circuits on or in buildings
(not ac! Only on or in buildings!):
690.31(D)(2)(1) Exposed raceways, cable trays and other wiring 
methods
690.31(D)(2)(2) Covers or enclosures of pull and junction boxes
690.31(D)(2)(3) Conduit bodies with unused openings
Label shall be:
• Every 10 ft
• Every section separated by:
• Enclosures
• Walls
• Partitions
• Ceilings
• Floors
The label specifications shall be:
• CAPITALIZED
• 3/8-inch height minimum
• White letters
• Red background
• Label shall be suitable for the environment used
Note: SOLAR PV DC CIRCUIT is made up of fewer letters, 
and takes up less space and resources, so it is better for the envir￾onment and helps save the planet.690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials 121
690.31(E) Bipolar Photovoltaic Systems
Discussion: Bipolar PV systems have a benefit that voltage, for the 
purposes of the Code, can be considered as being voltage to ground 
rather than the maximum voltage between any two conductors.
Analogy:
Your house in the US is wired at 120/240V split phase. This 
means that you will not have more than 120V to ground in your 
house; however, you can have an electric dryer that gets all the 
benefits of 240V. This is because your house is bipolar in a way 
and is grounded and has a grounded conductor right in the 
middle of that 240V.
A bipolar system has two monopole circuits (typically groups 
of strings), one positively grounded and the other negatively 
grounded. This type of system can potentially give the array 
25% of the power losses (75% savings) due to voltage drop 
at double the voltage and half the current that it otherwise 
would have.
The wiring rules with these systems state that we cannot have 
conductors next to each other that could have voltages greater 
than Code allows for the wiring method and the conductors. If 
these conductors are in the same location, they need to be able 
to handle these bipolar hot-to-hot voltages than are double of 
what the voltage to ground can be.
In other words, going bipolar does not give a designer the 
right to have two wires next to each other that have voltages 
greater than that for which they are rated.
At the time of the writing of the 2023 NEC, we did not see 
much in the way of bipolar systems. It is invigorating to think 
that we could have a “1500V to ground” ground-mounted 
system that would have conductors that could measure 3000V 
to each other and still be NEC compliant! That could be effi￾cient with the low relative currents. It is rumored that some 
bipolar plans may be in the works.
Bipolar systems were much more popular just over a decade 
ago when the maximum system voltage for all PV systems was 
600V rather than 1500V.122 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials
690.31(F) Wiring Methods and Mounting Systems
Roof mounting of PV systems does not need to comply with 
110.13.
110.13 Mounting and Cooling includes 110.13(A) Mounting and 
110.13(A) says that equipment shall be “firmly secured in place.” 
Since many PV systems are ballasted and held in place by weight 
and aerodynamics, 690.31(F) is formally allowing ballasted systems.
We are required by 690.31(F) to use an approved method to 
hold the PV and wiring methods in place and to design the wiring 
methods to allow for any expected movement.
690.31(F) Informational Note explains that expected movement 
is often included in structural calculations.
690.31(G) Over 1000 Volts DC
New in the 2023 NEC and referred to earlier all the way from 690.7 
Voltage and 690.12 Rapid Shutdown is the ability to have circuits 
on a building over 1000V. The reason this is here is because people 
want to have ground mounted PV systems, but still mount the 
inverters on the wall of a building.
In order to have dc circuits over 1000V on buildings, we have to 
comply with all three of the following:
690.31(G)(1) Not permitted for 1- and 2-family dwellings
690.31(G)(2) Not permitted for buildings with habitable rooms
(Redundancy, since this would include 1- and 2-family dwellings)
690.31(G)(3) The following must apply:
• Exterior of building
• 10 feet above grade (high as a basketball hoop so only those 
who can dunk can get shocked)
• Not greater than 33 feet along building (the length of Sean 
and Bill’s sailboat)
After this 690.31 Methods Permitted marathon comes the brief …
690.32 Component Interconnections
This section is specific to building-integrated (BIPV) systems.
Fittings and connectors that are concealed at the time of on-site 
assembly and listed for such use shall be:690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials 123
• Permitted for interconnection of modules
• Permitted for interconnection of array components
Fittings and connectors shall be at least equal to wiring method in:
• Insulation
• Temperature rise
• Short-circuit current rating
These fittings and connectors shall also be able to withstand the 
environment in which they are used.
To repeat, section 690.32 Component Interconnections was 
designed specifically for BIPV systems although it does not state 
this in the NEC, since BIPV (like microinverters) are not defined in 
the NEC. This is one reason why you need this book, to know these 
things, otherwise understanding 690.32 blindly would be confusing.
690.33 Mating Connectors
Connectors other than those covered by 690.32 Component 
Interconnections go here. These connectors are the primary 
connecters known to solar installers, including your typical MC4 
connector or a microinverter cable connector.
These connectors shall comply with all of 690.33(A) through (D)
The word “mating” was added to the title of this section in 2020. In 
the 2017 NEC, it was titled “Connectors.” This was to indicate what 
kind of connectors this section is specifying since there are many other 
types of connectors in the electrical world (e.g., spade connectors).
690.33(A) Configuration
Mating connectors shall be:
• Polarized (Example: positive or negative, but not both)
• Non-interchangeable (with other receptacles of other systems)
690.33(B) Guarding
Mating connectors shall guard persons against inadvertent con￾tact with live parts.124 690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials
As you can see from playing with a typical MC4 connector, you 
could not get your finger or tongue into the connector to touch 
metal. We have done the research, so do not try this at home.
690.33(C) Type
Mating connectors shall be latching or locking. If readily access￾ible and over 30Vdc or 15Vac then they shall require a tool for 
opening.
If mating connectors are not of the identical type and brand, then 
they shall be listed and identified for intermatability, as described 
in the manufacturer’s instructions.
Discussion: We are not allowed to use MC4 connectors 
with Amphenol H4 connectors since they are not listed as 
“intermatable,” although it was a common practice. Here we 
see there is a pathway for these different connectors to be used 
together. The process of intermatability is covered in UL 6703. 
Only two mating connectors currently used in the PV industry 
are intermatable. They are the Amphenol H4 and the Amphenol 
UTX. No other combination is officially intermatable. Any sales￾person claim that is not backed up by an official UL 6703 certifi￾cation is simply not true. Incidentally, how can you tell whether a 
salesman is lying?—their lips are moving.
690.33(D) Interruption of Circuit
Connectors shall be either one of the three following:
690.33(D)(1) Rated for interrupting current
690.33(D)(2) Require a tool for opening and marked either
• “Do Not Disconnect Under Load”
• “Not For Current Interrupting”
690.33(D)(3) Supplied as part of listed equipment
690.33(D)(3) Informational Note: Equipment, such as module 
level power electronics (including microinverters and dc-to￾dc converters) are often listed so that the connectors can be a 
load-break rated disconnect, even when the connectors say “Do 
Not Disconnect Under Load” on the PV module connectors 
themselves.690 Part IV Wiring Methods and Materials 125
690.34 Access to Boxes
Junction, pull, and outlet boxes (used for wiring) located behind 
PV modules shall be installed so that removing the module can 
make the wiring accessible.DOI: 10.4324/9781003189862-7
6 Article 690 Part V Grounding 
and Bonding
Bonding is electrically connecting metal together and grounding is 
connecting to earth.
690.41 PV System DC Circuit Grounding and Protection
Section 690.41 is only related to PV System DC Circuit Grounding 
and Protection. Not all PV systems have dc circuit grounding, but 
all exposed non-current-carrying metal equipment within a PV 
system that could be energized must be connected to the equipment 
grounding conductor (690.43).
Here are some simple Article 100 Definitions to get us 
grounded on grounding:
Grounding Electrode. A conducting object through which a 
direct connection to earth is established.
Grounding Electrode Conductor (GEC). A conductor used to 
connect the system grounded conductor or the equipment 
grounding conductor to a grounding electrode or to a 
point on the grounding electrode system.
Equipment Grounding Conductor (EGC). The conductive 
path(s) that provides a ground-fault current path and 
connects normally non-current-carrying metal parts of 
equipment together to the system grounded conductor, 
or to the grounding electrode conductor or both. (Also 
performs bonding.)690 Part V Grounding and Bonding 127
Ground. The earth.
Grounded Conductor. A system or circuit conductor that is 
intentionally grounded. [Often white or grey and called 
a neutral.]
Solidly Grounded. Connected to ground without inserting 
any resistor or impedance device. [An inverter that uses 
a fuse to detect ground faults is not solidly grounded (on 
the dc side).]
Functionally Grounded. A system that has an electrical 
ground reference for operational purposes that is not 
solidly grounded. [Most PV arrays are functionally 
grounded; the exception is usually going to be a very 
small, stand-alone PV system.]
Ground Fault. An unintentional, electrically conductive 
connection between an ungrounded conductor of an 
electrical circuit and the normally non-current-carrying 
conductors, metallic enclosures, metallic raceways, 
metallic equipment or earth.
Ground Fault Detector-Interrupter (GFDI). A device that 
provides protection for PV dc circuits by detecting a 
ground fault and could interrupt the fault path in the 
dc circuit. [This definition is new in the 2023 NEC, how￾ever not new in the PV industry. This is to differentiate 
between GFCI (below) and detecting and interrupting 
ground faults on the dc side of a PV system.]
Ground-Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI). A device intended 
for the protection of personnel that functions to de￾energize a circuit or portion thereof within an established 
period of time when a current to ground exceeds the 
values established for a Class A device. (Class A will trip 
between 4 and 6 mA.)

690.41 PV System DC Circuit Grounding and Protection
Typical ac system grounding is done by electrically connecting a 
current-carrying conductor to the grounding electrode system in 
a single place. The grounded conductor is generally colored white 
or natural gray for solidly grounded systems. Since PV systems 
often don’t produce extreme fault currents, due to the closeness 
between short-circuit current and operating current, we are func￾tionally grounding rather than solidly grounding dc PV arrays. If 
you see an older PV system that was installed using the 2014 NEC 
or earlier, there is often a white dc wire. This is most likely what 
we call functionally grounded now, but back then, we used to call 
grounding through a fuse “grounded,” which is no longer the case.
Take note that in the 2023 NEC it is clearly indicated that 
690.41 is for dc PV circuits, which was always the case, but is more 
clear now. The old title “system grounding” was confusing to those 
outside the PV industry, so the title of the section was changed to 
be more accurate and clear.
690.41(A) PV System DC Circuit Grounding Configurations
Most of the six configurations following are unusual and not worth 
paying much attention to for most solar professionals. Paying close 690 Part V Grounding and Bonding 129
attention to 690.41(A)(3) is a good idea, since well over 90% of the 
inverters installed these days are of the non-isolated type. For large 
utility-scale, MW-scale inverters we most often see the 690.41(A)(1) 
fuse grounded (formerly known as grounded) type of inverters, 
so pay attention to these too. Fuse grounded inverters were the 
popular inverters of the past for all systems.
690.41(A)(1) 2-Wire Circuits with One Functionally Grounded 
Conductor
This is our old-style fuse grounded solar inverter and was formerly 
known as a grounded inverter when applying the 2014 NEC and 
earlier. This type of inverter is still common in the large-scale MW 
inverter realm and seen often when doing maintenance on an old 
array. This was the most popular inverter in the US until 2013.
The old term often used for this type of inverter’s ground￾fault detection system is ground-fault detection and interruption 
(GFDI); however, as of the 2023 NEC, GFDI applies to all func￾tionally grounded inverters. This inverter bonds a grounded con￾ductor to the inverter internal grounding busbar through an 
Figure 6.1 Fuse grounded PV array with one functional grounded 
conductor.

solardesign.com.130 690 Part V Grounding and Bonding
overcurrent protection device (fuse). When there is a ground fault 
on the ungrounded conductor, currents will flow through a con￾ductive pathway to the GFDI fuse and open the fuse. The inverter 
will detect that the grounded conductor is no longer grounded, 
proceed to turn off the inverter, and then disconnect positive and 
negative at the inverter to prevent fires (you can still get shocked).
One of the reasons that this fuse grounded type of inverter has 
gone out of style for less than MW sized inverters, is that there is 
a blind spot for detecting ground faults. With all PV modules and 
conductors, things such as glass and conductor insulation are not 
perfect insulators, and some current will leak through the glass and 
insulation and complete the circuit through the GFDI fuse. On a 
small residential system, there is never enough leakage current to 
cause a problem, but, on larger systems, such as 30kW and up, the 
milliamps add up, and the current can be great enough to require 
the inverter to use a larger GFDI fuse. As the fuse gets larger for 
these leakage currents, it also inhibits the inverter’s ability to detect 
ground faults. Once there is a ground fault that is unseen (blind 
spot), another ground fault can short-circuit the whole PV array 
and fires can occur. There are ways that these older systems can be 
modified by monitoring the current to make them safer, but the 
Figure 6.2 Bipolar PV array.

solardesign.com.690 Part V Grounding and Bonding 131
easiest thing to do is install a newer, non-isolated inverter, which is 
cheaper, safer, and more efficient.
690.41(A)(2) Bipolar Circuits with a Functionally Grounded Center Tap
We have mentioned bipolar arrays a number of times in this book, 
and you can look in the index to read about bipolar arrays at every 
mention. Bipolar arrays are usually only seen in large utility-scale 
PV systems. We have not seen many between 2012 and 2023 being 
installed, but they may be making a comeback in some cases before 
the 2023 NEC goes out of style, according to our resident futurist.
690.41(A)(2) applies to these bipolar arrays with a functional 
ground reference (center tap).
A few people think of bipolar arrays as a way to sneak around 
the requirement for maximum voltage and double the system 
voltage. Bipolar arrays will give you double voltage benefits, so 
there is truth; however, now that we have ground-mounted PV 
arrays of 1500V to ground, there is less of an incentive to double 
the voltage, since 1500V is a lot and jumping to 3000V for effi￾ciency gains may not be worth doing.
690.41(A)(3) Arrays Not Isolated from the Grounded Inverter Output 
Circuit
This is the most popular inverter today, representing over 90% 
of inverters installed. Formerly and commonly (though somewhat 
inaccurately) known as an “ungrounded inverter” in the 2014 NEC, 
this inverter is now called a functionally grounded inverter and, 
according to 690.41(A)(3) text, we can officially call this inverter a 
not-isolated inverter or, as we prefer, a non-isolated inverter.
In Figure 6.3 on the next page Vin would be input voltage to 
the inverter. Vs is the source voltage (center-tap split-phase ac 
transformer).
The non-isolated gets its name because the inverter is not isolated 
from the grounded ac transformer. The reason that it was formerly 
thought of as ungrounded is because the PV array is ungrounded 
when the system is offline and grounded when operating. When 
this inverter is operating at 400V, we could expect the positive con￾ductor to measure 200V to ground and the negative to measure 
−200V to ground. This array is referenced to ground and does not 132 690 Part V Grounding and Bonding
have a voltage that is randomly floating around or isolated by a 
transformer when the inverter is operating.
These inverters are:
• cheaper
• safer
• lighter
• more efficient
than your old style, 690.41(A)(1) 2-wire PV arrays with one func￾tionally grounded conductor, inverters (fuse grounded).
Cheaper because no transformer to manufacture.
Safer because more sensitive ground-fault protection.
Lighter and more efficient since no isolation transformer.
Non-isolated inverter ground-fault detection:
Non-isolated inverters can detect ground faults much more sensi￾tively than fuse grounded inverters.
Figure 6.3 Non-isolated inverter showing ground-fault pathway.

solardesign.com.690 Part V Grounding and Bonding 133
Fuse grounded inverters have to have an allowance for leakage 
currents and the fuse must be upsized as more PV is added to 
the system.
Non-isolated inverters have different methods of detecting dc 
ground faults, such as:
• Insulation testing
• As the inverter wakes up in the morning, a quick pulse 
of voltage will be sent out along the current-carrying 
conductors into the array. If there is lower than expected 
resistance to ground, then there is a failed insulation 
test and signs of a ground fault. The inverter will not 
be allowed to start. We want to see millions of ohms of 
resistance in the insulation of a conductor and hundreds 
of thousands of ohms of resistance in a string of modules.
• Comparing positive and negative currents (residual current 
monitor)
• While operating, if positive does not equal negative, then 
the electrons must be taking an alternate path, otherwise 
known as a ground fault (or Martians are feeding on the 
electrons).
Using non-isolated inverters prevents fires since it can be up 
to 3000 times more sensitive to ground faults than old-school 
fuse grounded inverters! That’s as sensitive as the people who 
are offended by our dad jokes.
690.41(A)(4) Ungrounded PV Arrays
The NEC definition of an ungrounded array (figure 6.4 next page) 
is different from the 2014 and earlier editions of the NEC. This truly 
ungrounded PV array is not the 690.41(A)(3) “now known as non￾isolated array” (formerly known as ungrounded) but is an array that 
has no functional reference to ground. Imagine a fuse grounded 
inverter and then you threw the fuse away and the inverter was pro￾grammed to still work. This is essentially what we are talking about.
Now the only way to have an ungrounded array on an inverter 
connected to a grounded utility transformer on the ac side, is 
where the inverter has an isolation transformer, but with no fuse 134 690 Part V Grounding and Bonding
or connection between a current-carrying conductor and ground 
as in Figure 6.4. This array would be considered floating since the 
voltage could change with reference to ground. This inverter is 
uncommon and only currently used with some large utility-scale 
inverters. The array is monitored with a sensitive insulation tester 
on a continuous basis. This is a very simple and effective method 
of ground-fault detection.
There is no way to look at an inverter and know whether it is an 
ungrounded inverter. We are unaware of any ungrounded inverters 
currently listed in the United States. All the ungrounded units cur￾rently running in the US are in large-scale plants and have been certi￾fied to IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) standards.
690.41(A)(5) Solidly Grounded PV Arrays
A solidly grounded PV array (figure 6.5 next page) is one where 
there is a connection between a current-carrying conductor and the 
grounding electrode system that is not a fuse and is solid! This is like 
your house’s ac wiring.
Many old-style stand-alone systems, as well as some more 
modern stand-alone systems, are solidly grounded. Many dc PV 
systems are also solidly grounded.

Coming up soon in 690.41(B) [formerly 690.41(B) exception], 
we will mention that if an array is solidly grounded, has one or 
two PV source circuits, and is not on a building, then ground￾fault protection is not required. This way we can solidly ground 
the system.
As we can see in Figure 6.5, the grounding busbar is connected 
solidly to a grounded conductor. This is also an example of a dc 
direct-coupled PV system, which is common for water pumping 
systems in the California foothills.
Solidly Grounded Systems are Very Common, Just Not for 
PV Arrays
We are used to solidly grounded systems with typical elec￾trical systems. The reason it is uncommon with PV systems is 
because of the lack of high short-circuit currents, due to the 
current-limited characteristics of PV. With low short-circuit 
currents, we cannot rely on standard overcurrent devices to 
clear faults. We can only detect faults and shut down the 
system as a result of the fault. With a wild PV circuit, every￾thing including the overcurrent protection is sized based on 
at least 156% of a short-circuit current. So with a short it will 
not open a fuse.

690.41(A)(6) Circuits Protected by Equipment Listed and Identified 
for Use
PV technology is fast-moving, and the Code has left open a way 
for newer inventions to be Code-compliant if they are listed and 
approved. Over the years, several inverters have been certified to 
this option. One key example in somewhat recent history was 
the Advanced Energy Inverters that had an array configured in a 
bipolar-ish fashion.
These larger inverters were configured similarly to bipolar PV 
systems but had several features that were very different from 
bipolar arrays. Those inverters were among the safest inverters 
back when they were manufactured. 690.41(A)(6) makes sure the 
NEC does not disrupt inverter innovation for your next genius 
inverter idea. Please cut us in.
690.41(B) DC Ground-Fault Detector-Interrupter (GFDI) Protection
Circuits over 30V or 8A (most PV modules) shall have GFDI as 
seen in 690.41(B)(1) and 690.41(B)(2) below.
Solidly grounded PV source circuits are only allowed without 
GFDI if:
• No more than 2 in parallel
• Not on or in buildings
(This was formerly an exception in the 2017 NEC.)
Discussion: It may be less clear now, that the part about sol￾idly grounded systems with 2 or less in parallel, and not on or in 
buildings, is no longer an exception. To be clear, you can still have 
solidly grounded systems without GFDI that are over 30V and 
8A. The organization has changed, but the implementation has 
stayed the same, as with most NEC changes.
690.41(B) Informational Note
Not all equipment that dc PV arrays are connected to has GFDI. 
If GFDI is not included, then in the installation manual there is 
often a warning statement that indicates GFDI is not included. 690 Part V Grounding and Bonding 137
Equipment without GFDI is often smaller stand-alone equipment 
and not interactive inverters.
Discussion: The dc ground fault protection has to do with what 
you are connecting your PV array to, so it is not for a battery 
inverter in this Article 690 PV context. It is usually for an inter￾active inverter PV input or a charge controller PV input.
690.41(B)(1) Ground-Fault Detection
Ground-fault detection must meet all the following requirements:
• Detect ground faults in PV array dc circuits
• Detect ground faults in any functionally grounded conductors
• Listed for PV GFDI protection
Dc-to-dc Converters: Dc-to-dc converters sometimes are not 
listed to provide ground-fault protection and must work with 
listed GFDI protection equipment.
Informational Note: Some dc-to-dc converters without ground￾fault protection on their source (PV) side may prevent other 
ground-fault protection equipment from working properly. In 
other words, in some dc-to-dc converter cases:
GFDI + GFDI = No GFDI (two rights can make a wrong—
sounds political)
690.41(B)(2) Faulted Circuits
Faulted circuits shall be controlled by either one of the following of 
690.41(B)(2)(1) or 690.41(B)(2)(2):
• 690.41(B)(2)(1) Current-carrying conductors auto-disconnect. 
Current-carrying faulted conductors of the circuit will auto￾matically disconnect.
• 690.41(B)(2)(2) Power off, interrupt faulted PV dc circuits from 
the ground reference in functionally grounded systems.
Inverter or charge controller fed by faulted circuit will automatic￾ally do both:138 690 Part V Grounding and Bonding
• Stop supplying power to output circuits
• Interrupt PV system dc circuits from ground reference in func￾tionally grounded system
Discussion: A properly UL 1741 listed inverter will have been 
tested and listed for ground-fault protection.
Equipment Certification, UL and ANSI
Equipment certification is a de facto requirement of the 
NEC because it requires all equipment to be evaluated for 
the intended use in Section 90.7 Examination of Equipment 
for Safety. Underwriters Laboratories (UL) has been tasked 
by the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) 
to establish certification standards for the safety of PV 
equipment. There are numerous UL standards that are used 
for PV equipment. UL 1741 is the standard used for certi￾fying inverters and other PV related electronic equipment, 
such as charge controllers and dc-to-dc converters.
690.41(B)(3) Indication of Faults
GFDI equipment must indicate that there was a ground fault at a 
readily accessible location.
690.41(B)(3) INFORMATIONAL NOTE
Examples of indication methods include:
• Remote indicator light
• Display monitor
• Signal to monitored alarm system
• Notification by web-based services
Discussion: Web-based services can be a text message or an app 
notification. (Notice that smoke signals were not included, since 
that could be mistaken that the building is on fire—maybe it is if 
we did not address the fault…)690 Part V Grounding and Bonding 139
690.42 Point of PV System DC Circuit Grounding Connection
690.42(A) Circuits with GFDI Protection
Circuits protected by GFDI equipment according to 690.41(B) 
DC Ground-Fault Detector-Interrupter (GFDI) Protection, 
shall have circuit-to-ground connection made via GFDI 
equipment.
690.42(B) Solidly Grounded Circuits
Solidly grounded systems are grounded from any single point 
of PV dc system to the grounding electrode system in 690.47(A) 
Building or Structure Supporting a PV System (690.47 Grounding 
Electrode System is coming up on page 147).
Ground Fault Protection, GFDI and GFCI
Ground-fault protection is, in essence, determining if there 
is a connection to ground by a current-carrying conductor 
that was not meant to be. To determine if there is an extra 
connection (ground fault), then a ground-fault protection 
device must be keeping tabs on the state of the current￾carrying conductor vs. ground.
In any electrical system, more than one point of system 
grounding is called a ground fault. If there were two points 
of system grounding, then there would be a parallel pathway 
for current to flow along the grounding system or through 
equipment.
In the 2023 NEC the GFDI term was put into the NEC 
to differentiate between ground fault circuit interrup￾tion (GFCI) and ground-fault detection and interruption 
(GFDI). The term GFDI has been around for a while 
in the industry and often associated with fuse grounded 
systems. However, it is clear now that GFDI includes 
all PV dc ground fault protection and has nothing to do 
with GFCIs.140 690 Part V Grounding and Bonding

you back to 250.134, which sends you to other places that send 
you to other places, as is common for the very huge Article 250 
Grounding and Bonding.
Equipment grounding of PV systems is theoretically the same 
as equipment grounding of other systems; hence we refer to and 
take the rules from Article 250 when applying the Code to our PV 
system grounding systems.
For instance, 690.43 directs us to 250.134, which directs us to 
250.32, which directs us to 250.118 and so on and so forth.
Why Inspectors Like to Call You on Grounding and Bonding
Since equipment grounding of a PV system is similar to and 
takes much of its requirements from Article 250 Bonding 
and Grounding, inspectors who are not as familiar with PV 
systems as they are with other systems will often put a lot 
of effort into inspecting what they know, which is how to 
inspect grounding and bonding.
Here are some of the places that 250.134 can take you:
250.134 Equipment Fastened in Place or Connected by Permanent 
Wiring Methods (Fixed)
Here we are referring to bonding (grounding) non-current-carrying 
metal parts:
• You can be connected to the grounded circuit conductor as per￾mitted by either:690 Part V Grounding and Bonding 141
○ 250.32 Buildings or Structures Supplied by a Feeder(s) or 
Branch Circuit(s)
○ 250.140 Frames of Ranges and Clothes Dryers (690 brings 
you here, Wow!)
○ 250.142 Use of Grounded Circuit Conductor for Grounding 
Equipment
• Or you can be connected by one of the following:
○ 250.134(1) by connecting to equipment grounding 
conductors as permitted by 250.118(2) through (14)
• There is a typo in the 2023 NEC here, since 250.118 was 
reorganized, so it should say 250.118(A)(2) through (14). 
Perhaps by the time you read this, the typo will have been 
un-typoed.
• 250.118(A) lists types of EGCs permitted
• 250.118(A) sends us to enough places to write a book on 
grounding. If you are a super-grounding-nerd, you can 
read Mike Holt’s book on “Bonding versus Grounding,”
and we will be impressed when you stump us, and we 
expertly dodge your question in front of hundreds of 
people at a big important conference.
• Note: Soares is and has been wrong when it used the term 
“grounding.”
• 250.134(2) option is by connecting to an EGC that is 
contained within the same raceway, cable or run with circuit 
conductors.
• 250.134(2) Exception 1: As provided in 250.130(C) 
Replacement of Nongrounding Receptacle or Snap 
Switch and Branch Circuit Extensions, EGC shall be 
allowed to run separately.
• 250.134(2) Exception 2: For dc circuits, EGC shall be per￾mitted to run separately. (This is relevant to us dc people!)
Why Equipment Grounding?
A good reason for equipment grounding is to protect people. 
If a hot wire got loose and touched a piece of metal that was 
not connected to the equipment grounding conductor, then 142 690 Part V Grounding and Bonding
someone could touch that piece of metal and get shocked. 
Another good reason for grounding is a pathway for ground￾fault protection to signal the inverter when there is a ground 
fault. Without an equipment grounding conductor, ground￾fault protection would not work properly.
690.43(A) Photovoltaic Module Mounting Systems and Devices
Equipment that is listed, labeled, and identified for bonding PV 
modules (frames) is permitted for equipment grounding and 
bonding of PV modules. (Also, this equipment may be used to 
bond adjacent modules to each other.)
690.43(A) Informational Note: UL 2703 and UL 3703 are the 
standards used for bonding PV module frames. UL 3703 is used 
for trackers.
UL 2703 Standard: Standard for Mounting Systems, 
Mounting Devices, Clamping/Retention Devices, and 
Ground Lugs for Use with Flat-Plate Photovoltaic Modules 
and Panels.
When we think of UL 2703 listed racking systems, we 
often think of a clamping device that holds a PV module 
or piece of equipment in place and has a sharp point that 
will pierce the anodized coating of a piece of aluminum and 
make a Code-compliant equipment grounding pathway.
A big benefit to PV installers for using UL 2703 listed 
racking is the reduction in time and materials required by 
not having to undertake time-consuming grounding methods 
of the past, such as using lugs on each PV module with a 
collection of washers, antioxidant chemicals and using emery 
cloth to rub off the anodized coating of a module frame to 
get a good connection.
690.43(B) Equipment Secured to Grounded Metal Supports
Grounded metal supports are support structures that PV modules 
are mounted on that are already connected to the earth by any 690 Part V Grounding and Bonding 143
means permitted in Article 250. In order to bond PV equipment to 
grounded metal supports, the grounding devices must be:
• Listed = On a National Recognized Testing Lab (NRTL) list 
(search “OSHA NRTL” to find the list).
• Labeled = Has a label from the NRTL
• Identified = For specific use (no off-label usage)
Metallic support structure sections shall be either:
• Connected via identified bonding jumpers
• Connected to equipment grounding conductor (EGC) and 
support structure shall be identified
690.43(C) Location
• EGCs shall be permitted to run separately from the PV system 
conductors within the array
• If the EGC is run separately, follow 250.134 Equipment Fastened 
in Place or Connected by Permanent Wiring Methods (Fixed), 
which we just covered (see page 140)
Discussion: 690.43(C) in the 2020 NEC was called “With Circuit 
Conductors” and required us to run the EGC with circuit 
conductors, and now in the 2023 NEC we are more liberal and 
allow our EGC to be run separate from the circuit conductors, like 
other dc systems.
690.43(D) Bonding Over 250 Volts
For solidly grounded systems over 250V (rare), 250.97 Bonding for 
Over 250 Volts to Ground shall apply.
Here we see requirements about continuity of metal raceways 
and metal sheathed cables for solidly grounded systems over 250V 
to ground.
Where concentric or eccentric knockouts are encountered, there 
may not be sufficient continuity to clear large circuit breakers in a 
fault. This is more commonly referenced for ac systems over 250V 
to ground, since solidly grounded PV systems, especially those 
over 250V to ground, are rare.144 690 Part V Grounding and Bonding
No Bonding Bushings Required!
In the 2017 NEC and earlier, this 250.97 requirement for 
concentric and eccentric knockouts was not only for sol￾idly grounded systems, and many inspectors are still enfor￾cing the older requirements and making you install bonding 
bushings on functionally grounded dc PV systems over 250V. 
Politely show your inspector 690.43(D) if you do not like to 
spend time and money on bonding bushings where they are 
not required.
Sensitive ground-fault equipment required in functionally 
grounded systems can effectively use concentric and eccentric 
box connections without failing in a fault and therefore doesn’t 
need to follow 250.97.
690.45 Size of Equipment Grounding Conductors
PV system circuit equipment grounding conductors are sized 
in accordance with Table 250.122 Minimum Size of Equipment 
Grounding Conductors, which bases the EGC off the size of the 
overcurrent protection device.
If there is no overcurrent protection device (such as with one 
or two PV source circuits) then the value calculated in 690.9(B) 
Overcurrent Device Ratings (Isc × 1.56 for “wild PV”) for an 
assumed overcurrent protection device will be used in place of an 
overcurrent protective device value.

Recall that 690.9(B) (covered on page 57) calculates an 
overcurrent protection device based on either:
• 125% of maximum current calculated in 690.8(A)
○ Maximum circuit current × 1.25
○ Isc × 1.56 for PV source circuits (since Isc × 1.25 = max￾imum circuit current for “wild PV’)
• Maximum current and application of adjustment and correction 
factors (see Chapter 12 Wire Sizing)
• Electronic overcurrent protection device listed to prevent 
backfeed on PV side of device
• Equipment grounding conductor size shall not be smaller 
than 14 AWG
Discussion: It is interesting to note that, in many cases, mul￾tiple PV output circuits are not required to have more than a single 
14 AWG equipment grounding conductor when protected in a 
raceway. Many solar installers will size the equipment grounding 
conductor to be the same size as the current-carrying conductor 
for conductors up to 10 AWG. This is often done to decrease the 
possibility of a well-intentioned inspector questioning a Code￾compliant 14 AWG equipment grounding conductor.
Just to make a point here, it would be Code-compliant to have 
8 PV source circuits come off a rooftop in a raceway with 16 
different 10 AWG current-carrying conductors along with a single 
14 AWG equipment grounding conductor.
Since the smallest copper equipment grounding conductor 
in Table 250.122 is a 14 AWG, which is sized based on a 15A 
overcurrent device, then we can calculate the highest short￾circuit current value that will fit on a 15A fuse and use a 14 AWG 
equipment grounding conductor as follows:
Isc × 1.56 = 15A
Isc = 15A/1.56 = 9.6A
Therefore, if a PV module has an Isc value of over 9.6A, then it 
would need greater than a 15A fuse and greater than a 14 AWG 
equipment grounding conductor. And a PV module with an Isc 
over 9.6A would have a maximum series fuse rating of 20A (unless 
you could find a future module that had an Isc greater than 20A/
1.56 = 12.8A).146 690 Part V Grounding and Bonding
690.45 specifically states that “we do not have to increase EGC 
size for voltage drop considerations on either the dc or ac side of a 
PV system.” Since PV is the opposite of a load, current does not 
increase because of voltage drop. There are no NEC or safety 
requirements for PV systems regarding voltage drop. A 50% voltage 
drop would be illogical and very wasteful, but not necessarily a Code 
violation. This contradicts and supersedes Article 250; just because 
Article 250 penalizes you for doing the right thing (oversizing your 
current-carrying conductors) does not mean that 690 is going to 
go along with this reverse logic. Oversizing a current-carrying con￾ductor makes your PV system safer and more efficient, regardless 
of whether you up-size your EGC. Remember NEC Chapters 5 
through 7 modify and supersede Chapters 1 through 4.
Exposed to Physical Damage = 6 AWG Minimum 
Bare Copper
Oftentimes the equipment grounding conductors (EGCs) under 
the array are considered to be exposed to physical damage and, 
if that were the case, the bare copper equipment grounding con￾ductor would need to be a 6 AWG size minimum. Oftentimes 
in places with significant weather, such as snow and ice, the 
AHJ will require a 6 AWG bare copper equipment grounding 
conductor if exposed bare copper is used. In the Deep West, 
where the wind is relatively mild, oftentimes you see 10 AWG 
EGCs under the array, but in the East, you often see the AHJ 
require 6 AWG bare copper and some solar installers will use 
smaller green USE-2 to conserve copper.
If you are trying to talk your inspector into agreeing 
that you do not require a 6 AWG EGC, you can reference 
250.120(C) Equipment Grounding Conductors Smaller 
than 6 AWG, where it says that you need to be protected 
from physical damage in a raceway or cable armor, unless it 
is installed within the hollow spaces of framing members of 
buildings or structures and where it is not subject to phys￾ical damage. Since a PV array is a structure, you would have 
a good point. We are not saying that you would win the 
debate, but you would have an intelligent point to make. 
The unanswered question is, “What is considered subject 690 Part V Grounding and Bonding 147
to physical damage?” and the answer is regional and sub￾jective. In the end, how much do you really want to argue 
with an inspector when you are trying to get your project 
finalized?
It is interesting to note that, in the Chicago area, according 
to at least 10 people whose jobs it is to meet with inspectors 
every day, they require more heavy-duty intermediate metal 
conduit (IMC) or rigid metal conduit (RMC) instead of EMT. 
This is due to the extreme weather, but they allow 10 AWG 
EGCs under the array (because Bill told them it was okay 
20 years ago).
In other locations, installers are allowed, as they should be, 
to use green 10 AWG USE-2 wire under the array.
690.47 Grounding Electrode System
Are you one of the top PV experts in the country? Lace up your 
boxing gloves and welcome to 690.47, the section of 690 where 
there are heated debates on how to interpret how grounding elec￾trode systems are meant to be interpreted in the Code. Try not to 
take it personally if you have a different idea than your colleagues. 
Good debate can be fun! Especially when you are right and 
everyone else is wrong. YouTube search “2014 NEC 690.47(D) 
Mike Holt” for some excitement, where you will see Bill and Sean 
along with Mike, who endorses this book. Endorsement to your 
millions of NEC books, back at you Mike!
There are many factors to deal with here and grounding elec￾trode systems outside of PV are also hard to understand because 
the way they are implemented differs regionally. Factors such as 
wet earth, dry earth, lightning vortexes, corrosion, living on a rock, 
stray currents, proximity to large power production systems and 
more will influence people’s opinions on how to properly connect 
to earth.

690.47(B) Grounding Electrodes and Grounding Electrode

690.47 Grounding Electrode System was once again changed in the 
2023 NEC, with a bit less pointing to Article 250 in 690.47(A). 
In the 2020 NEC, 690.47(A) broadly pointed to 250 Part III 
Grounding Electrode System and Grounding Electrode Conductor, 
which is no longer the case.
690.47(A) Buildings or Structures Supporting a PV System
690.47(A) says that buildings or structures supporting a PV system 
shall utilize a grounding electrode system installed in accordance 
Figure 6.6 Mike Holt 2014 PV NEC team.690 Part V Grounding and Bonding 149
with 690.47(B) Grounding Electrodes and Grounding Electrode 
Conductors.
Additionally, 690.47(A) tells us that PV array equipment 
grounding conductors (EGC) shall be connected to a grounding 
electrode system in accordance with:
• Article 250 Part VII Methods of Equipment Grounding 
Conductor Connections
• Connection is in addition to 690.43(C) Location, which tells us 
now that the EGCs are permitted to be run separately from the 
PV system conductors within the array (see page 143).
Also building and structure array EGCs shall be sized in 
accordance with 690.45 Size of Equipment Grounding Conductors
(see page 144), which directs us to Table 250.122 Minimum Size of 
Equipment Grounding Conductors (see page 146).
Back to where we were. One of the two following will apply. 
690.47(A)(1) is for systems that are not solidly grounded, which 
is the majority of everything, and 690.47(A)(2) will apply to the 
extremely rare solidly grounded PV system not on a building.
690.47(A)(1) Not-Solidly Grounded Systems on buildings are 
allowed to have the EGC be the only connection to ground. This 
definitely means that for most systems installed today, we do not 
need a dc GEC like the old days. Dc grounding electrode conductors 
are just out of style.
690.47(A)(2) Solidly Grounded Systems on structures would 
have to comply with 690.41(A)(5) on page 134 and we size the dc 
GEC based on Table 250.166 Size of Direct-Current Grounding 
Electrode Conductor. Remember, these systems are only allowed 
where not on buildings so this is rare and we will not go too deep 
and waste your extremely valuable time.
690.47(B) Grounding Electrodes and Grounding Electrode Conductors
A grounding electrode system includes pieces of metal connected 
to earth and other pieces of metal connecting those pieces together 
and then to the grounding electrode system via a grounding elec￾trode conductor (GEC).
690.47(B) has been the controversial “back and forth” over the 
years. The conflict was this: should we have an additional auxiliary 
electrode (or electrodes) or not? In the 2008–2014 NECs, it was 150 690 Part V Grounding and Bonding
often interpreted as required, which upset people, but many did 
not install them. In the 2017 NEC, this section was reworded to 
make it clear that the additional auxiliary electrode was optional. 
Once again, in the 2020 and 2023 NEC it is optional, but no longer 
called auxiliary. Now it is just termed additional electrode(s).
Auxiliary Electrodes are electrodes that are attached to the 
equipment grounding system and do not follow the rules of typical 
electrodes. Now, apparently, we have to follow the typical rules for 
something optional.
In the 2008 to 2014 NEC 690.47(D), Additional Auxiliary 
Electrodes for Array Grounding said that these electrodes shall
be installed with two exceptions. These two exceptions essentially 
made it not required for systems on buildings. The exceptions were 
so poorly worded that few code enforcers allowed the exceptions 
and the result was that electrodes got installed on buildings with 
perfectly acceptable grounding electrode systems. This is now 
a low-key optional thing that someone can do if they want. One 
of the reasons for this being controversial was because lightning 
strikes to the earth can send a wave of voltage. If the wave hits an 
electrode and causes different voltages at different electrodes that 
are attached through equipment, then the equipment can sizzle 
and pop.
What these optional electrodes are: If you have an array on your 
roof, you are permitted to take a conductor from the array straight 
to a ground rod. This would also go for a ground mount; how￾ever, one way you can look at it is if your array is put in concrete 
or earth with metal, every post is electrically an additional elec￾trode. You can connect the 690.47(B) electrodes to the PV arrays 
on buildings to the metal structural frame of the building if you 
want. Keep in mind that this connection does not substitute for the 
EGC connection to the inverter. Without that EGC connection at 
the inverter, the ground-fault detectors will not work properly.

Labeling Summary
For Marking and Labeling Summary, go to page 155.
In the 2023 NEC, there was a lot of rearrangement towards the 
end of Article 690, and the 2020 NEC version of this chapter in PV 
and the NEC covered:
2020 NEC 690 Part VI Marking
2020 NEC 690 Part VII Connection to Other Sources
2020 NEC 690 Part VIII Energy Storage Systems
2020 NEC Other Material no longer in 690 as of 2017 NEC
Bill and his Code Making Panel 4 friends were busy consolidating 
and rearranging for the 2023 NEC and now we are left with just one 
short Part VI to finish off 690:
2023 NEC 690 Part VI Source Connections
This reduction of parts does not mean that all the other requirements 
that were in this chapter are gone. They just moved things and 
got rid of redundancies and irrelevancies. For instance, marking 
requirements for the rapid shutdown sign were moved to 690.12 
Rapid Shutdown. Some of the marking requirements disappeared 
since they were not saving lives and property, which the NEC is for. 
Other marking requirements did not need to be in the NEC, since 
things like the ac PV module specifications are already required to 
be on the backs of the ac PV modules according to the UL listing.
What we have decided to do to keep this chapter long enough 
to be a chapter and to help you have a single place to go for all 152 690 Part VI Source Connections + Labeling
your marking and labeling requirements, is to include marking 
and labeling in this chapter beginning on page 155. Many of these 
requirements are in other places in this book; however, people like 
having a single place to go for all these requirements.
Outline of 690 Part VI Source Connections
(In the 2020 NEC we had Part IV Marking and Part VII 
Connections to Other Sources.)
690.56 Identification of Power Sources (formerly 690.56 in Part 
VI Marking)
690.59 Connection to Other Sources (formerly 690.59 in Part VII 
Connection to Other Sources)
690.72 Self-Regulated PV Charge Control (formerly in Part VII 
Energy Storage Systems)
690.72(1) PV source circuit matches current and voltage of 
battery cells
690.72(2) 1hr < 3% charge requirement
690.56 Identification of Power Sources
In the 2023 NEC, all 690.56 does is send you to 705.10 Identification 
of Power Sources. To abbreviate here: Power sources need labeling 
to show location and to say, “CAUTION MULTIPLE POWER 
SOURCES.” A new 2023 NEC thing is we need to leave a phone 
number. For details go to page 195.
(OMG, what’s the number for 911?!—Sorry, blonde runs in the 
family.)
With PV systems, energy storage systems, and the grid, 
we can have power pushing in all directions, therefore it is 
prudent to identify what is going on for those who will be 
puzzled in the future. As the future happens, we will see more 
things connected, and with energy management systems 
(a.k.a. power control systems) we will discover that more 
things will be networked to work in harmony for a better 
grid experience.690 Part VI Source Connections + Labeling 153
690.59 Connection to Other Sources
690.59 Connection to Other Sources is very brief and sends us to 
Article 705 Parts I and II
• 705 Part I General (most of 705)
• 705 Part II Microgrid Systems (about 1 page of 705 to end)
Note that Article 712 Direct-Current Microgrids was removed in 
the 2023 NEC and is included in 705 Part II.
The majority of Article 705, including the interconnection 
requirements in 705.11, 705.12, and 705.13, is in Part I of 705. See 
page 196.
690.72 Self-Regulated PV Charge Control
Self-regulated PV systems have the benefit of not needing a charge 
controller but have the drawback of not being able to work at the 
optimal part of the IV curve. These systems are often designed so 
that they will operate towards the Voc end of the IV curve, so that 
an overcharge will not occur, or they can be designed so that the 
PV is undersized relative to the battery, yet so is the load. With 
the advent of less expensive and more reliable PV electronics, 
self-regulating systems are less common. An example often used 
for a self-regulating system is a buoy in the ocean with 35 solar 
cells, charging a 12V battery to operate a flashing light that takes 
very little energy. Another example is my small solar module that 
used to keep my old internal combustion engine (ICE) car battery 
topped off when I went away for extended periods of time. No 
charge controller is needed.
690.72 says: “A PV source circuit shall be considered to comply 
with the requirements for charge control of a battery without the 
use of separate charge control equipment if the circuit meets both 
of the following” which is 690.72(1) and 690.72(2) below.
690.72(1) Matching PV to Battery
The voltage of the PV should match the voltage of the battery(s) 
paying attention to the IV curve.154 690 Part VI Source Connections + Labeling
690.72(2) No Greater Than 3% per Hour
The current of the PV should not overcharge the battery(s) and we 
draw the line at no greater than 3% per hour of battery capacity, 
or as recommended by battery manufacturer.
Self-Regulating Systems
With self-regulating PV charge control, it is like we have a PV 
source circuit that is a silicon-based charge controller, using silicon 
to control things, when it is not a computer chip!
There is rumored to be a NABCEP PV Associate (PVA) exam 
question on self-regulating charge control, which is a nuisance for 
a PVA exam prepper like myself, since I have a question every week 
about self-regulating systems, and you never see them in real life, 
only on the PVA exam.
Self-regulating systems are designed for batteries that can take 
a float charge and lithium-ion batteries cannot take a float charge, 
since they are very efficient and do not self-discharge much at all. 
Sean recommends noting this in the NEC or removing 690.72, 
since if someone designed a self-regulating system to charge 3% 
of battery capacity in an hour with lithium-ion batteries, it could 
be a fire hazard. Lithium-ion batteries need a battery management 
system (BMS) to manage the charge, so they would not be self￾regulating with a BMS by definition.
The idea of PV self-regulation is still creative and very neat!
We do not recommend self-regulating charge control of lithium 
batteries on Boeing 787s. Sky fire is not cool.
This is the End of 690!
Marking and Labeling Summary
Marking and labeling of renewable energy systems can sometimes 
take you on a long trip throughout different chapters of the NEC. 
We are going to sum it up here, at least for the more common 
marking and labeling requirements. Take note that the labeling 
requirements of the 2023 NEC were reduced from those of the 
2020 NEC, so if you think you are missing something that was 
in the earlier versions, this can be the reason. For the rest of this 690 Part VI Source Connections + Labeling 155
chapter, we are going to have a license to use the word labeling for 
marking, placards, etc.
We will skip Article 480, since 690 tells us to use Article 706, 
plus many of the 480 requirements are the same as in 706.

Marking and Labeling Details
690.7(D) Marking DC PV Circuits [in 690.7 Maximum Voltage] 
(also page 33 of this book)690 Part VI Source Connections + Labeling 157
Requirement for marking highest maximum dc voltage in 
accordance with 690.7 at one of the three locations: DC PV dis￾connect or PV electronic power conversion equipment (inverter 
usually), or distribution equipment associated with PV system.
Note that there are no specific NEC requirements for the size, 
color, or wording of this label. Use common sense.

of PV Systems on Buildings] (also page 74 of this book)
Rapid Shutdown label
The 2023 NEC Rapid Shutdown (RSD) label has no color 
requirement, such as with previous NEC versions. Yellow is still 
acceptable.

The 690.12(D) RSD label location shall be “at each service 
equipment location to which the PV systems are connected or at an 
approved readily visible location and shall indicate the location of 
RSD initiation devices.” For specific letter sizes and requirements 
see page 74.
690.12(D)(1) Buildings with More than One Rapid Shutdown Type
[in 690.12 Rapid Shutdown of PV Systems on Buildings /
690.12(D) Buildings with Rapid Shutdown] (also on page 75 of 
this book, including image)
Sometimes PV systems were installed at different times on a building 
when there were different NEC rapid shutdown requirements. We 
do not see this on most PV systems.
690.12(D)(2) Rapid Shutdown Switch [in 690.12 Rapid Shutdown

The PV system disconnect is usually an ac disconnect and can be 
the same disconnect as the rapid shutdown initiation device, such 
as a circuit breaker or a fused disconnect. For a dc interconnected 
(dc-coupled) system, the PV system disconnect is probably a dc 
disconnect.
Also, 690.13(B) mentions another labeling requirement, which 
is often used when it does not need to be, perhaps the most often 
misused label.
The line and load label is only required to be used in a place 
where you turn the switch off and can still have voltage on both 
sides of the switch. This is not required for an interactive inverter 
output circuit since anti-islanding immediately de-energizes the 
output of an interactive inverter. If your PV system disconnect is a 
dc disconnect, then it probably does require this sign. An example 
of a dc PV system disconnect would be a disconnect at the end of 
a PV source circuit before it goes into a charge controller. Here you 
may have voltage from both sides after shutdown. We see this label 
in different articles that we cover. There are no specific font size or 
color requirements. Wording can be equivalent.
690.15(B) Isolating Device [in 690.15 Disconnecting Means 
for Isolating Photovoltaic Equipment] (also on page 89 of 
this book)

Here is what it says in the NEC: “Where an isolating device is not 
rated for interrupting the circuit current, it shall be marked ‘Do 
Not Disconnect Under Load’ or ‘Not for Current Interrupting.’”
This label is intended for a non-load-break rated isolating 
device or disconnect, which is used for equipment maintenance. 
We can see that this is usually marked on PV module connectors 
when you buy the PV modules. Other places where you need this 
marking are with finger-safe fuse holders and other non-load￾break disconnects.
690.31(D)(2) Marking and Labeling [in 690.31 Wiring Methods /
690.31(D) Direct-Current Circuits on or in Buildings] (also on 
page 118 of this book)
The requirement states that we can have the label read either 
SOLAR PV DC CIRCUIT or PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER 
SOURCE. We prefer the fewest letters.
This label shall be on exposed raceways, cable trays, other 
wiring methods, covers or enclosures of pull boxes, junction 
boxes, or conduit bodies (conduit bodies only if unused available 
openings).
Color is red on white background with at least 3/8" lettering.
Required for each section separated by enclosures, walls, 
partitions, ceilings, or floors. Spacing shall not be more than 
10 feet.
(No longer a reflective sticker requirement or the word 
“Warning” required.)

Power Production Sources] (also on pages 169 and 194 of

This is a complicated label (placard) and most, if not all, label 
companies are not doing this by the NEC requirements, which is 
not unusual.
There are no color requirements; however, you almost always 
see this one as red with white letters.
The exact words: “CAUTION: MULTIPLE SOURCES OF 
POWER” are supposed to be on the placard; however, you usually 
see different words, meaning the same thing.
The new in 2023 NEC requirement is to have an “emergency 
telephone number of any off-site entities servicing the power 
source systems.”
705.12(B)(2) and 705.12(B)(4) “120% Rule” label [in 705.12 Load￾Side Source Connections / 705.12(B) Busbars] (also on pages 
214 and 221 of this book)
Figure 7.9 Power source placard.
Figure 7.10 120% rule label.
Source: Courtesy Sean White.162 690 Part VI Source Connections + Labeling
It is interesting to note that the suggested wording for the label in 
the 2023 NEC has one fewer word than in the previous version. 
The previous version suggests: “WARNING: POWER SOURCE 
OUTPUT CONNECTION—DO NOT RELOCATE THIS 
OVERCURRENT DEVICE” and the 2023 NEC is the same, 
except for removing the word “CONNECTION,” which is prob￾ably a good thing, since this sticker is often small, so it can fit next 
to a circuit breaker in a crowded panelboard, so the fewer letters, 
the bigger they can be.
There are no specific color or size requirements for this label. It 
just must be adjacent to the circuit breaker and can be the same or 
equivalent wording.
705.12(B)(3) “Sum of the Breakers Rule” label [in 705.12 Load￾Side Source Connections / 705.12(B) Busbars] (also on page 217 
of this book)
This label is used only if you are using the 705.12(B)(3) Sum of the 
Breakers method/rule and there are no specific letter sizes or colors 
called out. Label should be applied to the distribution equipment, 
with no specifics about where on the distribution equipment.
705.20(7) “Line and Load Energized in Open Position” label [in 
705.20 Source Disconnecting Means] 
This is repeated in different parts of the NEC. Any time when you 
open (turn off) a disconnect and there is still voltage on both sides 
of the disconnect, then you put this label there. We covered this a 
Figure 7.11 Sum rule label.

few pages ago on page 159 in this label section regarding 690.13(B) 
and Figure 7.6.
705.30(C) Marking [in 705.30 Overcurrent Protection] (also on 
page 230 of this book)
The simplest thing here to do is quote 705.30(C) in its entirety:
Equipment containing overcurrent devices supplied from 
interconnected power sources shall be marked to indicate the 
presence of all sources.
There are no specifics, so here is a label that is used to fulfill these 
requirements:
705.82 Single 120-Volt Supply (also on page 188 of this book)
This label was previously in different articles. If we are using split￾phase 120/240V designed equipment for 120V loads that are all in

phase with each other, then the neutral can become overloaded if 
using multiwire branch circuits that were designed for out of phase 
circuits sharing a neutral. The wording does not have to be exact 
and can be equivalent. The NEC has an exclamation mark (!), and 
none of the prominent labeling companies had one, so we made 
our own!
706.4 System Requirements [Article 706 Energy Storage Systems] 
(also on page 241 of this book)
These markings are usually going to be marked on the Energy 
Storage System, so you just have to make sure that you do not hide 
them. The markings include:
(1) Manufacturer’s name, trademark, or other descriptive marking 
by which the organization responsible for supplying the ESS 
can be identified
(2) Rated frequency
(3) Number of phases, if ac
(4) Rating (kW or kVA)
(5) Available fault current derived by the ESS at the output 
terminals
(6) Maximum output and input current of the ESS at the output 
terminals
(7) Maximum output and input voltage of the ESS at the output 
terminals
(8) Utility-interactive capability, if applicable
706.15(C) Notification and Marking [in 706.15 Disconnecting 
Means] (also on page 243 of this book)
The ESS disconnecting means label needs to say:
“ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM DISCONNECT”
(1) Nominal ESS output voltage (this is usually ac voltage coming 
out of the “system”).
(2) Available fault current derived from ESS (this is usually limited 
by the inverter output and much lower than the available fault 
current from the utility).166 690 Part VI Source Connections + Labeling
(3) An arc-flash label applied in accordance with acceptable 
industry practices (since available fault current is usually limited 
by electronic power converter, the arc-flash danger is mostly 
from the utility and this requirement is questionable, unless you 
have a direct connection to battery cells or a utility-scale ESS).
(4) Date calculation was performed.
There are no 706.15(C) requirements for color or font size of 
the label. Markings can only be handwritten if the information 
is subject to change, and with a date calculation was performed 
requirement—this could be a case where the information is subject 
to change. Note that the available fault current, calculations, 
and arc-flash warnings are a holdover from the days when we were 
Figure 7.16 ESS Arc-Flash label, Tesla Megapack at Supercharger, 
Concord, CA.

Figure 7.15 ESS disconnecting means label for non-1- and 2-family 
dwellings (arc-flash label separate here).690 Part VI Source Connections + Labeling 167
connecting directly to batteries without electronics in between. With 
the electronics, there is a lot less available fault current and arc-flash 
hazard. The main hazard is coming from the utility.
Since 2, 3, and 4 above are NOT required for 1- and 2-family 
dwellings, then here is what your label will look like for your duplex 
or home.
One more thing about 706.15(C) ESS disconnect labeling: 
the line and load energized sticker, which you saw on page 159, 
Figure 7.6, is only required if there can be voltage on both sides 
of the disconnect after the switch is off. So for an interactive 
inverter only circuit, this sticker is not required, unless your ESS 
can operate in backup mode. Then you probably can have voltage 
on both sides after opening the disconnect.
A Word about 110.21(B) Field Applied Hazard Markings
Many of our labeling requirements reference 110.21(B), 
which pretty much says that we need to use labels “of suf￾ficient durability to withstand the environment involved 
and warn of the hazards using effective words, colors, 
symbols, or any combination thereof.” There are no specific 
requirements here; however, there is an Informational Note 
that directs us to ANSI Z535.2-2011, which can give us ideas 
about colors and symbols. Recall that Informational Notes 
are not requirements; however, the AHJ may require what￾ever they want, since they have Zeus-like powers. (If your 
inspector has Dionysus-like powers, offer them a bottle of 
wine in order to pass.)
Additionally, 110.21(B) tells us to permanently affix the 
labels and not to use handwriting, unless the information is 
Figure 7.17 ESS disconnecting means label for 1- and 2-family dwellings.
Source: photo by Sean White.168 690 Part VI Source Connections + Labeling
subject to change. Does this mean that if the information is 
not subject to change, we can put the pen in our teeth and write 
as long as we don’t use our hands?
706.15(E)(3) Remote Activation [in 706.15 Disconnecting Means 
/ Disconnecting Means for Batteries] (also on page 245 of 
this book)
This requirement is only for cases where there are no electronics 
(inverters or dc-to-dc converters) associated with the batteries 
and where a remote switch for a disconnecting means is used. 
This is not common and perhaps there is no such thing as a UL 
9540 listed system of this type. In this case, on the disconnecting 
means itself, you put a label indicating where the remote switch is 
located. There are no special requirements for the wording, font, 
or anything else about this label. We recommend plaid labeling 
(joke).
706.15(E)(4) Notification [in 706.15 Disconnecting Means /
Disconnecting Means for Batteries] (also on page 245 of 
this book)
As with 706.15(E)(3), this is only for where you have high available 
fault currents, like batteries without electronics, not your typical 
ESS. This label has the same requirements as the ESS disconnect 
label we recently covered on page 166 and in Figures 7.15 and 7.16, 
except we do not mark it as an “ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM 
DISCONNECT,” and there are not exceptions for 1- and 2-family 
dwellings.
The International Residential Code (IRC) requires a UL 9540 
listed ESS, and you probably are not going to find one that does 
not have electronics protecting the batteries, unless it was listed 
after the publishing of this book.
706.21(A) Facilities with Utility Services and ESS [in 706.21 
Directory (Identification of Power Sources) (also on page 248 
of this book)690 Part VI Source Connections + Labeling 169
706.21(A) sends you to 705.10 Identification of Power Sources, 
which is on page 160 in this marking and labeling section of 
this chapter. Essentially, you need to identify the different power 
sources.
706.21(A) Facilities with Stand-Alone Systems [in 710.10 
Identification of Power Sources] (also on page 248 of this 
book)
We will show an image of this label coming up on page 252 when 
we cover Article 710 Stand-Alone Systems.
706.41 Electrolyte Classification [in 706 Part V Flow Batteries] 
(also on page 250 of this book)
Electrolytes shall be identified by name and chemical composition.
710.10 Identification of Power Sources [in 710 Stand-Alone 
Systems] (also on page 252 of this book)
Label shall be at power source disconnecting means or an 
“approved readily visible location” and shall include the location(s) 
of power source disconnecting means for building.
If there are multiple sources, such as a PV system and an ESS, 
then markings will comply with the 705.10 requirements covered 
on pages 160 and 194 and Figure 7.9. In most cases you are 
Figure 7.18 Stand-alone single power source label.170 690 Part VI Source Connections + Labeling
going to have more than one source; however, if you have a single 
multimode inverter with PV and battery inputs and a single dc 
disconnect, then perhaps you can try and consider it one source. 
A direct water pumping system on a building would qualify as 
a single power source, but not something you will see every day 
or ever. Perhaps 710.10 can be made better next time around. 
We recommend using the 705.10 label and ignoring Figure 7.18
unless you have a direct PV pump house with no other power 
source.
710.15(C) Single 120-Volt Supply [in 710.15 General] (also on page 
255 of this book)
This is only when you supply 120/240V distribution equipment 
with a 120V stand-alone inverter.

8 Article 691 Large-Scale 
Photovoltaic (PV) Electric 
Supply Stations
Article 691 was new in the 2017 NEC and there is not a whole lot 
to it (about one page in the NEC). There are certain things that 
can be done with these larger systems, under the supervision of an 
engineer, which cannot be done with smaller systems.
In the past, our excuse for changing the rules on these large 
“utility-scale” solar farms was that we decided to call them util￾ities, and utilities are not subject to the requirements of the NEC. 
Utilities typically use engineering standards and the National 
Electrical Safety Code (NESC) for designing their systems. The 
question has always been: Is it really a utility? Now, we can use 
the NEC and no longer have to look for a “utility” loophole 
when installing large-scale PV. Also, many jurisdictions did not 
buy that a large-scale PV system was like utility-owned properties 
and would enforce Article 690. Many local AHJs do not have the 
training and experience to inspect a large powerplant and are more 
qualified to inspect distributed generation PV systems, such as PV 
systems on or near buildings.
Not being able to treat a large solar facility like a large coal, 
nuclear, or natural gas facility, when it comes to the local AHJ and 
the NEC, was discriminatory against renewable energy. Finally, 
the NEC woke up!

691 Large-Scale Photovoltaic (PV) Electric Supply Stations
A 5+MWac PV system can be installed outside of the scope of 
691, for instance, on a building. Just because a PV system is larger 
than 5MW does not automatically make it compliant with 691. 
It must meet all of 691.4’s special requirements, with being over 
5MWac just one of the requirements. (See page 175.)
691.1 Scope
Article 691 only applies to PV systems not under exclusive utility 
control.
Note: In the 2020 NEC 691.1 was where we were told that the 
PV system had to be over 5MWac and this part was moved to 
691.4(7) (page 178).
Section 691.1 Scope mostly consists of Informational Notes, 
including an image, which is a type of Informational Note here. 
Recall that Informational Notes are not enforceable parts of the 
Code and are just good ideas.691 Large-Scale PV Electric Supply Stations 173
691.1 Informational Note 1 tells us that these 691 systems are 
unique, are only to supply a regulated utility, and to look to 691.4 
Special Requirements for Large-Scale PV Electric Supply Stations 
(page 175).
691.1 Informational Note 2 tells us that utility-owned properties 
are not the domain of the NEC (even 691) and to see the National 
Electrical Safety Code (NESC).
There is also a typo in 691.1 Informational Note 2. Like the 
2020 NEC, it refers us to Section 90.2(B)(5). There is no longer a 
90.2(B)(5) in the 2023 NEC, since it was moved to 90.2(D)(5). In 
the 2023 NEC it should have said 90.2(D)(5) rather than 90.2(B)(5).
Get your bearings in Article 90 here:
• Article 90 Introduction
• Section 90.2 Use and Application
• 2023 NEC 90.2(D) Installations Not Covered tells us the NEC 
does not cover certain installations, like cars, mobile homes, 
boats, trains, etc.
90.2(D)(5), like 90.2(B)(5) in the 2020 NEC, tells us that installations 
under exclusive control of the utility do not follow the NEC, such as 
service drops, transmission, distribution, metering, generation, etc.
NESC
There is a reference in 691.1 Informational Note No. 2 to 
the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), which is also 
known as ANSI Standard C2 and is published by IEEE.
• ANSI is the American National Standards Institute. 
ANSI accredits standards that are developed by other 
standards organizations, government agencies, consumer 
groups, companies, and others.
• IEEE is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers. World’s largest association of technical 
professionals with more than 423,000 members in over 
160 countries.174 691 Large-Scale PV Electric Supply Stations
Discussion: Most utility-owned PV supply stations look just like 
every other PV power plant that uses Article 691, although they 
are not using the NEC. This makes equality for utility-owned and 
non-utility-owned large-scale PV. Perhaps this equality for non￾utility-owned PV should also be the 28th amendment to the US 
constitution.
Discussion: The image in 691.1, which is the only image in Article 
691, is showing a single-line diagram (SLD) of a dc PV power source 
going to an inverter and then to a medium or high voltage trans￾former with the switchgear (overcurrent protection and disconnecting 
means) on the medium/high voltage side of the transformer. 
Medium voltage is typically many thousands of volts; however, there 
are different definitions of how low, medium, and high voltage are 
defined. In the 2020 NEC, this “informational” image was slightly 
different and where it now says, “medium or high-voltage substation 
or switchgear,” it used to say, “substation optional.” Additionally, 
where it used to say, “electric production and distribution network,” 
it now says “medium or high-voltage network.” These changes are 
for clarity and make no substantial difference.
High-Voltage and Medium-Voltage Benefits
Oftentimes the utility-scale solar plant will have medium￾voltage connections inside the plant and then all the 
Figure 8.1 Informational Note Figure 691.1 Identification of large-scale 
PV electric supply station components.

medium-voltage cables will combine at a substation where the 
voltage will be boosted to high voltage. An example would 
be medium voltage of 34.5kV and high voltage of 115kV. At 
115kV a MW would be 1000kW/115kV/1.732 = 5A. As you 
can see, with higher voltage, the current goes way down!
691.4 Special Requirements
Section 691.4 stayed mostly the same as in the 2020 NEC; how￾ever, 691.4(6) and 691.4(7) were added. 691.4(6) is a new require￾ment for a “central command center,” which sounds pretty cool. 
691.4(7) was moved from 691.1. 691.4 is the longest Section in a 
short Article.
691.4(1) Qualified Persons
Electrical circuits and equipment shall be maintained and operated 
only by qualified persons.
Discussion: Qualified person as defined in NEC Article 100:
One who has skills and knowledge related to construction and 
operation of electrical equipment and installations and has 
received safety training to recognize and avoid the hazards 
involved.
This means that there is no hard definition of qualified persons; 
however, common sense should prevail. Some people consider 
NABCEP certification as a way of showing that someone is quali￾fied, and others believe that an electrician is qualified personnel. 
Perhaps only people reading this book are truly qualified. It would 
also depend on the job someone is doing. The average person who 
is qualified to install solar racking systems at a large solar plant 
is likely not qualified to work on medium-voltage or high-voltage 
equipment.
It is interesting that 691.4(1) Informational Note directs us to 
NFPA 70E Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace for 
the qualified personnel definition and that it is the same exact 176 691 Large-Scale PV Electric Supply Stations
definition that we find in NFPA 70, the NEC. Perhaps NFPA is 
doing a good job at trying to sell more books. We should learn 
from them!
691.4(2) Restricted Access
Access to PV electric supply stations shall be restricted by fen￾cing or other means in accordance with 110.31. Additionally, 
field-applied hazard markings shall be applied in accordance with 
110.21(B).
110.31 Enclosure for Electrical Installations is in Article 
110 Requirements for Electrical Installations Part III Over 
1000V, Nominal and this section of the Code goes into the 
details of how to keep unqualified people out of the electrical 
installation.
Some of the other means besides fencing for keeping the PV 
area restricted to qualified people according to 110.31 are:
• vaults
• rooms
• closets
• walls
• roofs
• floors
• doors
• locks
691.4(2) also directs us to 110.31 Enclosure for Electrical 
Installations and here we find Table 8.1.

691.4(3) Medium- or High-Voltage Connection
The connection between the PV electric supply station and the 
utility shall be made through a medium-voltage or high-voltage 
method, such as the following:
• switchgear
• substation
• switchyard
• similar method
There are different definitions of medium- and high-voltage, 
but a general consensus is that medium voltage is over 1000V, and 
here we are typically talking about connections that are between 
4000 and 500,000V.
That means no 480V 5MW projects here. That would be a lot 
of current.
5MW / 480V / 1.732 for 3-phase = over 6000A!
691.4(4) Loads Only for PV Equipment
The only loads allowed in a PV electric supply station are those to 
power the auxiliary equipment used in the process of generating power.
Examples of loads would include monitoring equipment, wea￾ther stations, lights, controls, and PV maintenance equipment. 
(I guess that means no 5MW cell phone charging. Sorry if you 
bought that new HVDC 5MW USB-C charger, sucker.)
691.4(5) Not Installed on Buildings
Article 691 will not apply to PV systems installed on buildings. 
This does not mean that PV systems larger than 5MW cannot be 
on a building; it means that the special rules in Article 691 will not 
apply to any PV system installed on a building. Article 690 applies 
in all cases where Article 691 does not apply for PV and the NEC.
Question: If you had 5MW over an underground Y2K bunker, 
would it be “on a building”?—I don’t think so, Tim.
691.4(6) Central Command Center
“The station shall be monitored from a central command center.”178 691 Large-Scale PV Electric Supply Stations
Discussion: This is new in the 2023 NEC. There is no NEC def￾inition of central command center. We are assuming that it has 
nothing to do with NATO and that the reason this is here is that 
Bill is a Spaceballs movie fan.
691.4(7) >5MW
Invoking Article 691 can only be done with systems with an 
inverter generating capacity of at least 5000kW. There is also an 
Informational Note clarifying that individual sites operated as a 
group with a total generating capacity of 5000kW fit this definition.
691.4(7) is nothing new and was formerly in 691.1 Scope in the 
2020 NEC.
Article 100 Definition: Generating Capacity, Inverter
The sum of the parallel-connected inverter maximum 
continuous output power at 40°C in watts, kilowatts, volt￾amperes, or kilovolt-amperes.
Essentially this is the ac output of the inverter. New to the 
2023 NEC is the definition of Inverter Generating Capacity 
expanded to include apparent power and not just real power. 
Apparent power is often expressed in kVA and is different 
from real power when your power factor is less than 1.
Oftentimes the dc PV portion of a PV system is sized 
between 1.2 and 1.5 times greater than the inverter gener￾ating capacity for large-scale PV projects. We have seen as 
high as a 2:1 ratio!
The NEC likes to use kW rather than MW for big power, 
but we like to use MW, since it sounds more big time!
691.5 Equipment
Equipment shall be approved by one of the following methods:
691.5(1) Listing and Labeling
A listed PV module tested to UL 61730 and labeled would be an 
example.691 Large-Scale PV Electric Supply Stations 179
691.5(2) Field Labeling and Identified for Application
Typically, field labeling would be having a Nationally Recognized 
Testing Lab (NRTL), such as UL, TUV, CSA, or Intertek send 
someone out to approve of the product and give it the lab’s label 
while it is in the field. These field labels may represent a subset of 
the tests that are conducted on factory labeled equipment since not 
all tests are feasible in the field.
691.5(3) Engineering Review
When listing and labeling or field labeling are not available, an 
engineering review can take place to validate that the equipment 
is evaluated and tested to an industry standard or practice. Keep 
in mind this method is only available if the other two methods 
are not available. It is up to the AHJ whether to approve of this 
process.
691.6 Engineered Design
Documentation stamped by a licensed professional engineer shall 
be made available at the request of the AHJ.
The engineer shall be independent and retained by the 
system owner.
Additional stamped engineering reports shall be made available 
upon request of the AHJ, documenting:
• Compliance with Article 690
• Alternative methods used not in compliance with Article 690
• Alternative methods used not in compliance with the NEC
• Compliance with industry practice
Discussion: What this means is that under engineering super￾vision, we are allowed to stray from Article 690 when we meet 
the requirements of Article 691. Section 691.6 is a documented 
version of what is commonly performed during the plan check 
phase of a construction project. Several examples of typical 
areas where a large-scale PV system is likely to take exception to 
Article 690, or the rest of the NEC, are listed in 691.8 through 
691.11.180 691 Large-Scale PV Electric Supply Stations
691.7 Conformance of Construction to Engineered Design
Documentation that construction of the project followed the elec￾trical engineered design shall be made available to the AHJ upon 
request.
Additional licensed professional electrical engineer stamped 
reports detailing that construction conforms with the NEC standards 
and industry practice shall be provided to the AHJ upon request.
The engineer shall be independent and retained by the 
system owner.
Discussion: Section 691.7 is a documented version of what is 
commonly performed during the field inspection phase of a con￾struction project.
691.8 Direct-Current Operating Voltage
Included in the documentation required by 691.6 Engineered 
Design shall be voltage calculations.
691.9 Disconnecting Means for Isolating Photovoltaic Equipment
Isolating devices (non-load-break rated disconnecting means) shall 
be permitted to be remote from the equipment. (690.15 Disconnecting 
Means for Isolating Photovoltaic Equipment / 690.15(C) Equipment 
Disconnecting Means requires isolating devices or remote oper￾ating devices to be 10 ft from equipment and 691 can let us ignore 
this requirement.)
Put in engineered design if disconnecting means remote from 
equipment:
• Written safety procedures ensure only qualified persons service 
equipment.
• Maintenance conditions ensure only qualified persons service 
equipment.
• Supervision ensures only qualified persons service equipment,
Informational Note: Lockout-Tagout procedures are in NFPA 
70E Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace. For main￾tenance information, see NFPA 70B Recommended Practice for 
Electrical Equipment Maintenance.691 Large-Scale PV Electric Supply Stations 181
Adherence to 690.12 Rapid Shutdown is not required for buildings 
whose sole purpose is to protect PV supply station equipment.
Written standard operating procedures detailing shutdown 
procedures in case of emergency shall be available on site.
691.10 Fire Mitigation
691.10 was changed from Arc-Fault Mitigation to Fire Mitigation, 
which was the whole point of arc-fault mitigation, to prevent fires. 
No other wording was changed in 690.10, except for the addition 
of a new Informational Note. This Informational Note tells us that 
fire mitigation plans are typically reviewed by the local fire agency 
and include things such as local access roads.
If PV system does not comply with 690.11 Dc Arc-Fault 
Protection, then included in the documentation in 691.6 Engineered 
Design shall be fire mitigation plans to address dc arc-faults.
Example of Fire Mitigation Plans
• Include specific details for firefighting within the PV 
plant.
• Include access in and around the PV plant for fire depart￾ment equipment.
• May provide on-site suppression capabilities including 
extinguishers at each inverter pad and tanker trucks with 
fire hoses for early response.
• May include personnel on site during operating hours 
that can see fires as they get started.
• “Hot Work” practices followed for cutting and welding 
within the facility.
• (“Hot Work” is the main cause of fires in a large-scale PV 
facility.)
691.11 Fence Grounding
Fence grounding requirements and details shall be included in the 
documentation in 691.6 Engineered Design.182 691 Large-Scale PV Electric Supply Stations
691.11 Informational Note
Directs us to:
250.194 Grounding and Bonding of Fences and Other Metal 
Structures
250.194 relates bonding and grounding of fences to substations, 
and the Informational Note does not mean we are required to 
follow 250.194; however, it is a good reference. We are looking out 
here for things such as step voltages, which means that in certain 
instances you could take a step and the voltage could be different 
one foot to the next if a power line hit the ground. Ouch! (This 
means that electricians with shorter legs are inherently safer.)
250.194(A) Metal Fences goes on to say that we need to bond 
fences that are within 16 ft of exposed electrical conductors or 
equipment.
250.194(A)(1) Bonding jumpers are supposed to be every 160 ft 
and at fence corners.
250.194(A)(2) When bare overhead connectors cross over a 
fence, bonding jumpers shall be on each side of the crossing.
250.194(A)(3) Gates shall be bonded to gate post which shall be 
connected to electrode system (people have been shocked by 
opening a gate if different sides of the gate are not bonded 
to each other).
250.194(A)(4) Gate or opening in fence shall be bonded by 
buried bonding jumper.
250.194(A)(5) Grounding grid or electrode systems shall cover 
the swing of gates.
250.194(A)(6) Barbed wire strands above the fence bonded to 
the electrode system.
Question: Why ground the barbed wire? To protect the criminals? 
How about a medium-voltage electric fence to keep out the riffraff?
Article 691 Overview
When installing a large-scale PV system in the past, PV companies 
were often forced to pretend that they were a utility. Using Article 691 Large-Scale PV Electric Supply Stations 183
690 for compliance with a 100MW power plant was never the 
intended use of Article 690. These large systems are unlike smaller 
systems, in that they are not accessible to the public, as are PV 
systems on buildings or in backyards. With the ability to do things 
under engineering supervision that stray from the requirements of 
Article 690, we are no longer put into a position where we have 
to pretend that we are a utility, and that the system is behind a 
utility fence.
Utilities may still build and operate PV systems that are not 
required to be compliant with the NEC; however, it is now Code￾compliant to build a large PV system that does not comply 100% 
with Article 690. This flexibility can actually improve operation, 
maintenance, and safety for these large power plants.DOI: 10.4324/9781003189862-10
9 Article 705 Interconnected Electric 
Power Production Sources
As both Articles 690 and 705 developed over time, the requirements 
in 690.64 were incorporated into Article 705 in the 2011 NEC. 
With the advent of much more distributed generation coming 
onto the grid from solar PV, wind, and other sources, Article 705 
has grown in size and importance.
In this chapter, our main focus will be on the most important 
solar PV and energy storage related material in Article 705, which 
is connecting utility interactive inverters to the grid. However, 
microgrids are becoming more important, so another important 
focus will be ac and dc microgrids.
In the 2020 and 2017 versions of the NEC, there was Article 
712 DC Microgrids, which was removed in the 2023 NEC, and we 
now look to Article 705 for dc microgrids. See microgrid definition 
on page 267.
Many of the requirements of Article 705 are satisfied by the 
listing of the interactive inverters.
Reviewing an outline of an article before studying the article 
helps us get properly situated and our minds organized to study 
the article.

705.1 Scope
Article 705 covers the installation of multiple power sources 
connecting in parallel, such as from a renewable energy source and 
the utility. One of the power sources must be a primary power 
source.
Usually, it is the grid that is the primary power source, but there 
can be exceptions, such as when Chuck Norris connects to the grid, 
the grid becomes secondary. This last statement was a joke, but we 
would like to think that, as we are producing and storing our own 
energy more and more, the grid sometimes is the smaller part of 
the power and energy that we are using.
705.1 Informational Notes, Including Informational Note 
Figures
A very noticeable change in Article 705 is the movement of the 
images for ac-coupled and dc-coupled systems from the beginning 
of Article 690 to the beginning of Article 705. These images are 
still for informational purposes only, and have changed somewhat, 
besides being moved. Even the terms ac-coupled and dc-coupled 
have changed to ac-interconnected and dc-interconnected.
705.1 Informational Note 1: A Primary Power Source May 
Be a Utility or an On-site Electric Power Source
Discussion: The utility part is obvious; however, if there is no 
utility, then something must be primary. We may look at this “pri￾mary” as the drummer of a rock band making the beat (frequency). 
If we had designed an off-grid system with multiple inverters in the 
past, the primary power source may have been called a “master” 
and the secondary something even more offensive that we cannot 
say in this book, or else we would get kicked off Twitter (at least 
in the good old days). We now have “less offensive to everyone” 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 189
terms called “primary power source” and “secondary primary 
source.” Once you are in island-mode with your microgrid, you 
need to assign something to be primary. A simple example of 
this is with a small microgrid with a single battery inverter that is 
the primary power source working with interactive PV inverters, 
which follow the primary inverter’s frequency. If you have multiple 
battery inverters in your microgrid, then you have to assign one to 
be primary. You cannot have two frequencies in a microgrid, which 
would be like having two people steering a sailboat in different 
directions, or to use a musical analogy, good jazz.
705.1 Informational Note Figure(s)
These are the images that were modified and moved from Article 
690 in the 2023 NEC. Let us first look at the images (Figures 9.1 
and 9.2 on the following two pages) and then talk about them. The 
two images are treated as one in the 2023 NEC.
Difference in 2023 and 2020 NEC images (recall that these 
images are for informational purposes only and there are many 
variations so it is unlikely that your system will look exactly 
like this):
• Dc coupled multimode system changed to DC interconnected 
example
• Ac coupled multimode system changed to AC interconnected 
example
• Microgrid Interconnect Device (MID) is not in 2020 NEC 
image (See MID definition on page 267)
○ In dc interconnected example MID is internal to inverter
○ In ac interconnected example MID is external to inverter
• PV power source changed to power source
• PV system disconnect changed to source disconnect
• Interactive disconnect changed to source disconnect
• Electric power production and distribution network changed to 
primary source
• Dedicated loads changed to ac loads
Informational Note Figure 705.1 Discussion: Changing coupled to 
interconnected: This will be a difficult change in terminology, since 
we have been using the term for so long. Coupled will probably be 190 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources

power source components in common configurations.

used in the industry, just like solar panel, which is also no longer 
defined or used in the NEC.
MIDs in the image: MIDs were always in your typical multi￾mode inverter, even before the term MID was in the NEC. This 
was how your multimode inverter could disconnect from the grid 
and switch from interactive-mode to island-mode when the grid 
goes down before we were using external MIDs. Recall that these 
images are examples only and an ac interconnected system may have 
its MID internal to an inverter, and a dc interconnected system may 
have an external MID.
It appears that the images being moved to Article 705, and the 
modifications to the images, reflect energy storage being more 
popular. The Code is being more inclusive of different power 
Figure 9.2 2020 NEC Figure 690.1(A) (part of image).

sources being connected together, and not being as PV-centric, 
although we know that PV is most important, at least until we can 
control small fusion reactions with banana peels.
705.5 Parallel Operation
705.5 Parallel Operation was 705.14 Output Characteristics in the 
2020 NEC and was moved around and reworded, with a list in it 
for the 2023 NEC, just to keep us on our toes. There is no diffe￾rence in how we implement this material.
705.5 should be covered by the UL 1741 listing of the inverter, 
which is also mentioned in an Informational Note. Interactive 
inverters installed in the US must be listed to UL 1741 and satisfy 
the requirements of 705.14.
705.5(A) Output Compatibility
Power production sources (inverters) operating in parallel shall 
have compatible voltage, wave shape, and frequency. As a side 
note, a power production source could be a rotating generator; 
however, very few non-inverter technologies have a UL 1741 
listing.
Discussion: If this were not the case, a UL 1741 inverter in 
interactive mode would not turn on. There was an Informational 
Note in the 2020 NEC that said being compatible with the wave 
shape does not mean matching the wave shape. Sometimes we will 
want to modify the wave shape to condition the power and make 
it better. For instance, many utility-scale inverters are required to 
make reactive power, which means making a wave shape different 
than what is on the grid. Many smaller-scale PV systems, such as 
the one on your house, will make perfect power factor to a grid 
that has an imperfect wave form. Perhaps this Informational Note 
did not need to be in the 2023 NEC, since after reading this book, 
the industry found it obvious that the wave shape does not have 
to match. Another example of a wave shape not matching, would 
be an inverter injecting reactive power into the grid, to improve 
the power quality and transmission capacity. Reactive power 
can support the voltage when electricity is transmitted over long 
distances, and for utility-scale PV systems, there are requirements 
for providing reactive power.705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 193
Wave Shaping for a Better Grid with Inverters That Work 
at Night
There are some inverters that are being modified to condition 
the power quality on the grid even at night when there is no 
solar energy available. Since we are putting the solar inverters 
on the grid, it does not take a lot to modify the inverters to 
condition the grid. All we need is the policy in place to make 
it feasible and in the UK an organization called Lightsource 
BP is doing this. Get ready for more in the future, especially 
when there is energy storage involved.

705.5(B) Synchronous Generators
Synchronous generators shall be installed with the required syn￾chronizing equipment.
705.6 Equipment Approval
Equipment shall be approved for intended use. We need to use 
equipment that is approved for interconnection to the grid or to 
operate in parallel with other power production sources.
Equipment that should be listed interactive or field labeled and 
evaluated interactive includes:
• interactive inverters
• engine generators with special controls
• energy storage equipment
• wind turbines
Recall that the listing standard for an inverter is UL 1741.
705.6 Informational Note 1
Reference to UL 1741, Standard for Inverters, Converters, 
Controllers, and Interconnection System Equipment. Stand-alone, 
island, interactive, and multimode:194 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
• stand-alone sources = island mode
• interactive sources = interactive mode
• multimode sources = island mode or interactive mode
705.6 Informational Note 2
Interactive functions are also common in:
• microgrid interconnect devices (MID)
• power control systems (PCS)
• interactive inverters
• synchronous engine generators
• ac energy storage systems
• ac wind turbines
705.8 System Installation
Installations only to be performed by qualified person (see pages 
16 and 175 of this book for discussion on qualified person). Or see 
Article 100 Definition of Qualified Person.
705.10 Identification of Power Sources
Permanent plaques, labels, or directories shall be installed at each 
service equipment location or at an approved readily visible loca￾tion in accordance with 705.10(1) through (3) below.
705.10(1) Disconnecting Means Location
Denote each power source disconnecting means location.
Discussion: This means that if you have a separate disconnecting 
means in different locations for three PV systems, two energy 
storage systems, one Ford F-150 bidirectional EV Supply 
Equipment (charger/discharger), and one service disconnect, then 
you will need seven signs in seven locations. This is nothing new 
and is a theme.
705.10(1) Exception
If multiple disconnecting means are in one location, then one sign 
per location is sufficient.705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 195
705.10(2) Emergency Phone Number
Have emergency phone numbers of off-site entities servicing power 
systems.
Discussion: This is a new requirement to provide contact 
information when those responsible for the operation of the 
equipment are off-site. This would also include companies that 
have a service agreement to maintain the system who also must 
respond if the equipment malfunctions. Since many systems 
require specialized technicians, it was decided that this language 
would help emergency personnel locate qualified technicians to 
help during an emergency where the equipment is involved. This 
is new!
705.10(2) Informational Note
We are referred to 2021 NFPA 1 Fire Code (which is not adopted 
in most states, since most states adopt the International Fire Code) 
and here is all it says:
11.12.2.1.5 Installer Information
A label shall be installed adjacent to the main disconnect indi￾cating the name and emergency telephone number of the com￾pany currently servicing the PV system.
This sounds like a good idea. Perhaps every fire department 
should have a phone number of a solar and storage “quali￾fied person” nearby, so they can jump out of bed and share 
knowledge, which can save lives. Do not go putting your ex’s 
phone number on that label, unless they are “qualified” (sing 
867-5309).
705.10(3) “CAUTION: MULTIPLE SOURCES OF POWER” Label
“CAUTION: MULTIPLE SOURCES OF POWER” shall be 
marked on the label in accordance with 110.21(B). 110.21(B) is a 
common reference for labeling, which essentially tells us that the 
label needs to last a long time and not be handwritten.196 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
If there is an emergency, the firefighters would like to know 
the location of every power source disconnecting means, so 
they can know when they turn everything off. This plaque, 
label, or directory must be displayed at every power source 
disconnect location, and must show all the other power 
source disconnect locations. Firefighters do not want to think 
they have turned off the building only to find out that they 
missed a power source disconnect hidden in the backyard. 
The information in 705.10 has been an important theme in 
the NEC throughout the years.
The NEC has no definitions of plaque, “label,” or direc￾tory and added label to 705.10 in the 2023 NEC.
Interconnections 705.11 and 705.12
Part of the magic of PV systems is connecting inverters to the 
grid and sending power backward. For an electrician who is used 
to power always coming from one direction, this can be new and 
exciting. We can have fewer currents coming from the utility and 
busbars fed from both ends. In a way, this is how the grid looks to 
a utility with multiple power plants. Hopefully they use the 120% 
rule when connecting a nuclear powerplant to the grid.
Time to dive in!
705.11 Source Connections to a Service (Formerly Supply-Side 
Source Connections)
In the 2023 NEC, we see the former 705.11 “Supply-Side Source 
Connections” changed to “Source Connections to a Service,” so 
we no longer have “Supply-Side Connections” and we never had 
“Line-Side Taps” in the NEC, but we can still say these terms off￾line, or perhaps we can just take the hyphen out between supply 
and side. Besides renaming, mostly rearranging and making lists 
are the 705.11 2023 NEC changes.
A source connection to a service (formerly supply-side connection) 
is the connecting of a parallel power source, such as a solar inter￾active inverter, on the supply side of all overcurrent protection on a 
service. If the inverter is on the load side of any over-current protection 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 197
protecting loads, then it is not a supply-side connection. Typically, 
supply-side connections are between the main breaker and the meter. 
A feed-in tariff PV system (rarer in the US) would also be connected 
on the supply side of both the main breaker and the service meter. 
This type of installation could also be covered by 705.11.
We treat a source connection at a service, like a service, so we will 
mostly be using the rules from Article 230 Services, so remember, 
Article 230 is Services. We will be talking a lot about 230 here.
Here is the Article 100 definition for Service: “The conductors and 
equipment connecting the serving utility to the wiring system of 
the premises served.”
705.11(A) Service Connections
An electric power production source (usually PV or energy 
storage) can be connected to a service by one of the following 
three methods in 705.11(A)(1) through (3) and must comply with 
705.11(B) through (F) (pages 198–203).
705.11(A)(1) New Service
In accordance with 230.2(A), which is in 230.2 Number of Services
and just tells us that additional services can supply interconnected 
power production sources, as a special condition, among other 
things, such as fire pumps. Although the wording here says supply, 
isn’t it we who are supplying them?
705.11(A)(2) Supply Side of Service Disconnecting Means
In accordance with 230.82(6), which is part of 230.82 Equipment 
Connected to the Supply Side of Service Disconnect, much like 
with 705.11(A)(1), which is for new services, it tells us we can 
connect our power production equipment to the supply side of 
the disconnecting means for our existing services using overcurrent 
protection as specified in Part VII of Article 230.
Article 230 Services / Part VII Service Entrance Conductors is 
telling us to treat our supply-side connected systems like a service. 
This contains the wiring methods for services.
Take note that 230.46 Spliced and Tapped Conductors tells us 
that we need to use pressure connectors and splices that are marked 198 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
“suitable for use on the line side of service equipment or equivalent.” 
Check your Insulation Piercing Connectors (IPCs), if you are using 
them, to make sure they are suitable and can handle short circuits.
Even though we are directed to Article 230 Services, solar and 
storage is not a service, but is treated like a service when we look up 
our wiring methods. (We are talking about being an electrical ser￾vice here and not how great of a service you offer your customers, 
and your solar service agreement.) The service we are talking about 
here is where the utility serves you electricity.
705.11(A)(3) Additional Set of Service Entrance Conductors
We can connect to an additional set of service entrance conductors 
in accordance with 230.40 Exception Number 5.
230.40 Number of Service-Entrance Conductor Sets has a limit 
of one set with many exceptions. The exception we are looking for 
is No. 5.
This exception tells us that we can connect systems covered by 
230.82(5) and 230.82(6). We just covered 230.82(6), which tells us 
we can connect our power source on the supply side (page 197), and 
230.82(5) tells us that we can connect energy management systems 
(EMS), stand-by systems, fire pumps, etc.
Microgrid Interconnect Devices and Source Connections at a 
Service (MID and microgrid defined on page 267)
Is it a source connection to a service (supply-side connection) 
when you connect a MID to service entrance conductors? 
Your MID will have a “main breaker” inside of it, so the 
answer is no since your power production source will be on 
the load side of that MID’s service disconnecting means 
(main breaker).
705.11(B) Conductors (Source Connections to a Service / Supply-Side)
In the 2020 NEC, 705.11(A) was Output Rating and is now moved 
to be part of 705.11(B) Conductors as 705.11(B)(1)705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 199
705.11(B)(1) Output Rating (Ampacity ≥ Sum of Maximum Circuit 
Current)
The sum of the power source continuous currents cannot exceed the 
ampacity of the service conductors. The power source continuous 
currents are defined in 705.28(A) Power Source Maximum Output 
Current (page 205) and are just the continuous current ratings 
on the label of the interactive inverter or as programmed into an 
Energy Management System.
We do not take the size of the inverter OCPD, loads, or the 
size of the main breaker into consideration when determining the 
maximum amount of inverter rated current that we can connect 
with a source connection at a service. Typically, with a source 
connection to a service, you can connect as much PV as you will 
ever need. However, some large commercial facilities may want to 
install PV systems even larger than their service ratings to zero 
out their relatively high day and night electricity consumption. 
These large systems typically require a significant service upgrade, 
including a larger service transformer, or invoking 705.13 Energy 
Management Systems (EMS) [formerly Power Control Systems 
(PCS)]. We will learn about these systems soon on page 222 and 
how they can control the power direction and quantity, just like we 
need it. With the EMS/PCS, in theory, we can connect as much 
inverter capacity as we want, if our artificial intelligence (AI) 
pays attention to the current on the service conductors and makes 
sure there are not dangerous situations. This is the future! Even a 
current-limiting function on an inverter with a CT (current trans￾former) monitoring service conductors will perform this function.
705.11(B)(2) ≥ 6 AWG Copper or 4 AWG Aluminum
The power source output circuit (inverter output circuit) conductors 
from the point of interconnection to the first overcurrent device 
shall be sized in accordance with:
• Source connections at a service shall be at least 6 AWG copper or 
4 AWG aluminum.
• 705.28 Circuit Sizing and Current (see Chapter 12 Wire Sizing). 
This is practically the same wire sizing techniques for all 
conductors carrying continuous current in the NEC. Nothing 
new here except organization.200 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
705.11(B)(3) Ampacity of Other Service Conductors ≥ (B)(1) and (B)
(2)
This is obvious and almost does not need to be stated. We need to 
comply with 705.11(B), which we are finishing now.
705.11(C) Connections (Source Connections to a Service)
The material here was organized into the list format, which is a 
theme for the 2023 NEC, more lists!
705.11(C)(1) Splices or Taps
Splices or taps shall be made in accordance with 230.33 for under￾ground or 230.46 not underground.
230.33 Spliced Conductors is in 230 Part IV Underground Service 
Conductors and sends us to 110.4, 230.46, 300.5(E), 300.13, and 
300.15. We are going to list some of the places that we are sent to 
and name the different Sections; however, if we went into detail 
of every place we were sent, we would go in circles and this book 
would be too heavy to carry. We recommend looking it up in the 
NEC if you are doing a really weird source connection to a service
or consulting with a really smart PE.
The connections shall be made using listed conductors as 
described in 110.14 Electrical Connections. 110.14 pretty much says 
that we need to torque and install the listed conductors according 
to instructions, which was how they were tested during the listing 
process, while also paying attention to 110.14(C) Temperature 
Limitations, which we will take into account in our wire-sizing 
chapter beginning on page 287 of this book.
230.46 Spliced and Tapped Conductors
300.5(E) Splices and Taps
110.14(B) Splices
300.13 Mechanical and Electrical Continuity – Conductors
300.15 Boxes, Conduit Bodies, or Fittings – Where Required
230.46 Spliced and Tapped Conductors is in Part IV Service 
Entrance Conductors and sends us to 110.14, 300.5(E), 300.13, 
and 300.15, which we just covered when discussing under￾ground source connections to a service.705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 201
Additionally, the following devices must be listed as suitable for 
line side of service equipment (or equivalent):
• power distribution blocks
• pressure connectors
• devices for splices or taps
So, you cannot make a source connection at a service with 
something that is not service rated. We have to treat it like a ser￾vice and remember that there can be higher currents coming from 
those service conductors.
705.11(C)(2) Existing Equipment
Modifications to existing equipment must be made in accordance 
with manufacturer’s instructions, or field labeled for the application.
Discussion: we have seen many people do a source connection 
to a service (formerly supply-side connection) inside of all-in-one 
meter-main combo service equipment, which is not supposed to be 
done, unless it is able to be done according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions or if you paid an NRTL to field label it.
705.11(C)(3) Utility-Controlled Equipment (new name in 705.11, but 
obvious)
For meter socket enclosures or other equipment under control of 
the utility, only connections approved by the utility are allowed.
705.11(D) Service Disconnecting Means 
(Source Connections to a Service)
• All ungrounded conductors of a power production source must 
run through a disconnect so they can be opened.
• Look to 230 Parts VI and VII.
○ 230 Part VI Service Entrance Conductors
○ 230 Part VII Service Equipment
Once again, we treat solar and storage (power production sources) 
like a service when connected on the supply side of the main ser￾vice disconnect.202 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
705.11(E) Bonding and Grounding (Source Connections to a Service)
Remember that when we are talking about source connections to a 
service, we are talking about alternating current and not that weird 
PV dc grounding.
Metal enclosures, metal wiring methods, and metal parts 
associated with a service connected to a power production source 
shall be bonded in accordance with Article 250 Grounding and 
Bonding Parts II through V and VII.
• 250 Part II System Grounding
○ This is where it tells us to ground a source connection at a 
service like a service and not to bond neutral to ground on 
the load side of the service equipment, like we used to in the 
exciting and sparky past.
Why We Bond a Source Connection to a Service “Like” a 
Service…
Some people worry about objectionable currents sneaking 
by, just like you cannot have two points of system grounding 
on a normal single service, such as bonding neutral to ground 
at a subpanel. The reason we treat a source connection to a 
service, like a service, is because we are on the supply side of 
all overcurrent protection, just like if you had a duplex and 
a separate meter and two separate service disconnects, then 
you have two separate points of system grounding. It is a big 
difference if you are on the supply side of all overcurrent pro￾tection. One of the problems with grounding and bonding, is 
that there is no perfect solution, and we have to look for the 
best solution, which sometimes can be different in different 
places, because of lightning, the conductivity of earth, and 
obviously crop circle vortexes. They probably do it this way 
on different planets since it is based on physics.
705.11(F) Overcurrent Protection (Source Connection to a Service)
In the 2020 NEC, we were directed to 705.30 Overcurrent protec￾tion; however, now we are directed to Article 230 Services, more 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 203
specifically 230 Part VII and 230.95 (assuming ground fault pro￾tection is required).
• 230 Part VII Service Equipment Overcurrent Protection. Some 
of the more notable things here are:
○ Requiring OCPD in ungrounded conductors
○ OCPD part of service disconnecting means or immediately 
adjacent
○ Disconnecting means on the line side of fuses
• 230.95 Ground Fault Protection of Equipment (Included in 
Part VII) abbreviated
○ Ground-fault protection required for solidly grounded 
WYE services more than 150V to ground (not residential) 
and less than 1000V phase to phase (not typical).
• 230.95(A) Setting
○ Ground-fault protection shall open all ungrounded 
conductors of faulted circuit.
• 230.95(B) Fuses
○ If switch/fuse combination used, fuse shall be able to inter￾rupt current higher than the interrupting capacity of the 
switch during time ground-fault protection system will not 
cause switch to open.
• 230.95(C) Performance Testing
○ Ground-fault protection shall be performance tested when 
first installed.
705.12 Load-Side Source Connections
Most solar installers and electricians prefer a load-side connection, 
since it is easy to turn off the main and safely pop in a solar 
breaker, just like they pop in a load breaker. Now with energy 
storage being so popular and expected to become more popular, it 
makes a load-side connection even more desirable. When you want 
backup power, you need to isolate from the grid and be on the load 
side of the service disconnecting means.
We are permitted to connect solar on the load side of any distri￾bution equipment on the premises.
Examples of distribution equipment eligible for a load-side 
connection include:204 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
• Panelboards
Article 100 Definition:
A single panel or group of panel units designed for assembly 
in the form of a single panel, including buses and automatic 
overcurrent devices, and equipped with or without switches 
for the control of light, heat, or power circuits; designed to 
be placed in a cabinet, enclosure, or cutout box placed in or 
against a wall, partition, or other support; and accessible only 
from the front.
A main service panel and a subpanel are common examples of 
panelboards.
• Switchgear
Article 100 Definition:
An assembly completely enclosed on all sides and top with sheet 
metal (except for ventilating openings and inspection windows) 
and containing primary power circuit switching, interrupting 
devices, or both, with buses and connections. The assembly may 
include control and auxiliary devices. Access to the interior of 
the enclosure is provided by doors, removable covers or both.
A switchgear acts like a panelboard for a big service.
• Switchboards
Article 110 Definition:
A large single panel, frame, or assembly of panels on which are 
mounted on the face, back, or both, switches, overcurrent and 
other protective devices, buses, and usually instruments.
Informational Note: These assemblies are generally access￾ible from the rear as well as from the front and are not intended 
to be installed in cabinets.
Switchboards (to differentiate from switchgear) can meter, 
reroute power and divide incoming power into smaller circuits. 
Switchboards are used at building electrical voltages whereas 
switchgear can be used at all voltages.705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 205
Much of the load-side connection material in the 2023 NEC 
was rearranged, but it is mostly the same in practice and theory as 
it was in the 2020 NEC.
In the 2023 NEC, 705.12(A) Dedicated Overcurrent and 
Disconnect was changed to 705.12(A) Feeders and Feeder Taps. 
Also, NEC 705.12(B) Bus or Conductor Ampere Rating was 
changed to 705.12(B) Busbars, which formerly included the 
material which is now in 705.12(A) and the material still in 
705.12(B).
2020 NEC 705.12(C) Marking, 705.12(D) Suitable for 
Backfeed, and 705.12(E) Fastening were moved from 705.12 to 
705.30, so now we only have 705.12(A) Feeders and Feeder Taps, 
and (B) Busbars to keep track of in this section.
705.12 Load-Side Source Connections also tells us to comply 
with “relevant” sections of 705.12(A) and (B), so perhaps it is 
obvious to the AHJ what relevant is, at least after reading this 
chapter. Perhaps the next edition of the NEC should have an 
Informational Note telling us to read this book. Bill, can you set 
that up?
705.12 then tells us that the currents we use here are the max￾imum circuit currents calculated in 705.28(A) Power Source 
Output Maximum Current, which essentially tells us to use the con￾tinuous current of a circuit that is limited by an energy manage￾ment system (EMS), which we will get into when we study 705.13 
Energy Management Systems.
705.12 then tells us to use 705.12(A) for feeders and taps and 
705.12(B) for busbars.
705.12(A) Feeders and Feeder Taps
An example of a feeder is a conductor that is going from a main ser￾vice panel to a subpanel.
705.12(A)(1) [Feeder Ampacity ≥ 125% Inverter Current] is so 
obvious that we do not need to study it. 705.12(A)(1) just tells us 
that the feeder ampacity must be at least 125% of inverter current, 
which is entry level wire sizing.
If we are going to connect to the middle of a feeder, we need to 
make sure that the conductor is properly protected on the load side 
of the source connection, and we apply 705.12(A)(2) [Load side of 
Inverter Connection to Feeder]. The reason we are concerned about 206 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
the load side of the connection to the feeder rather than the supply 
side, is because by adding more supply current with our interactive 
inverter to the feeder, we are no longer protected by the feeder 
supply breaker. Before the interactive inverter was added, the 
feeder supply breaker was the protection for the feeder. However, 
by adding another current source, we can have the potential for 
overcurrents if we do not comply with 705.12(A)(2)(a) [Feeder 
Ampacity ≥ Feeder OCPD + 125% Inverter Current] or 705.12(A)
(2)(b) [OCPD ≤ Feeder Ampacity on Load Side of Connection 
Point].
705.12(A)(2)(a) [FEEDER AMPACITY ≥ FEEDER OCPD + 125% INVERTER 
CURRENT]
We add the feeder supply breaker plus 125% of the inverter current 
for this calculation. If the ampacity of the feeder on the load side of 
the inverter connection can handle the sum of these currents, then 
the feeder will be safe. If the existing feeder is not large enough, 
then we can replace that load-side portion of the feeder with a 
larger feeder. This would rarely ever happen in the field, but the 
option exists for those who want to use it.

705.12(A)(2)(b) [OCPD ≤ FEEDER AMPACITY ON LOAD SIDE OF 
CONNECTION POINT]
Another option rather than 705.12(A)(2)(a) is to place an 
overcurrent protection device on the load side of the connection 
of the interactive inverter to the feeder that is not greater than the 
ampacity of the feeder.
If we had a 100A feeder, a 100A feeder breaker, and a 30A 
inverter, we could place a 100A breaker on the load side of the 
connection between the interactive inverter connection to the 
feeder and the loads.
There have been different interpretations on where this breaker 
can be placed. The safest place to put the breaker is adjacent to the 
connection of the inverter circuit to the feeder. This was the intent 
when this provision was drafted by Bill in the 2014 NEC. Others have 
the opinion that a “main” breaker in the subpanel will provide this 
protection. The main reason for putting the breaker adjacent to the 
PV connection is that no one can argue that taps could be installed 
between the PV connection and the subpanel that could overcurrent 
the feeder conductor downstream of the PV connection.
Figure 9.4 705.12(A)(2)(b) overcurrent device protecting feeder.
Note: If 25-foot tap rule is applied here, then the OCPD can be located up to 25 ft 
from inverter–feeder connection point, and perhaps in the subpanel, if the tap rules 
are followed, including the feeder being inside of a metal raceway.

We can best describe how far we can put the 705.12(A)(2)(b) 
feeder overcurrent device from the connection point to the 
feeder by using the 705.12(A)(3) tap rules which we will study 
in more depth in 705.12(A)(3) [Tap Conductors use 1/3 of feeder 
breaker + 125% Inverter Current] coming up next. In most cases, 
we would use the 25-foot tap rule and we can place the 705.12(A)
(2)(b) feeder OCPD in the subpanel if it is within 25 feet of the 
connection point to the feeder. We could also place that 705.12(A)
(2)(b) feeder OCPD on that conductor anywhere within 25 feet of 
the connection point (it does not have to be at the subpanel). This 
special case of putting the OCPD in the subpanel, rather than 
directly on the load side of the PV connection, assumes the tap 
rules in 240.21(B) (see page 208) are followed, which requires that 
the tap conductor is in a raceway and not an existing feeder that 
is not in a raceway, which is another reason to put the OCPD at 
the connection point. Few houses have conduit on any conductors 
other than their service conductors. There are some who think 
that they can place the 705.12(A)(2)(b) feeder OCPD as far as 
Figure 9.5 Solar tap rules.

they want from the connection point, and it is up to the AHJ to 
decide.
705.12(A)(3) [Tap Conductors Use 1/3 of Feeder Breaker + 125% 
Inverter Current]
Rather than referring to 240.21(B) Feeder Taps in general (other￾wise known as the “tap rules”), the 2023 NEC more specifically 
directs us to 240.21(B)(2) Taps Not Over 25 ft (known as the 25-ft 
Tap Rule) and 240.21(B)(4) Taps Over 25 ft. This is skipping the 
10-foot tap rule since only those taps sized under the 25 ft tap rules 
are necessary to consider when applying 705.12(A).
Solar Tap Rules, Merging 705.12(B)(2) with 240.21(B)(2) 
and (B)(4)
This is complicated, so pay careful attention and read this a 
few times. Speed reading not allowed here.
We are connecting an extra current source to a feeder, 
so we need to make sure if we go a long distance that all 
conductors involved can handle a short circuit and in turn, 
open (turn off) that feeder-protecting OCPD, which supplies 
the line side of the feeder. We are not just looking at the 
inverter output circuit, we are also looking at the load side of 
the point of connection to any overcurrent protection device, 
so going from the point of connection to the feeder to the 
overcurrent protection device on the load side connection point.
If we have an inverter connected to a feeder, we should 
check the inverter output circuit. If we were applying the 
25-foot Tap Rule for instance, we would need to make sure 
that there is an OCPD within 25 feet of where the inverter is 
connected to the feeder.
Electricians are familiar with the tap rules in 240.21(B)(2) and 
(4) and solar installers are often confused about what a “tap” is 
since as solar installers we are often and, for the most part, incor￾rectly calling a source connection to a service a “line-side tap.”210 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
In order to apply the tap rules in 240.21(B)(2) and (4), we need 
an overcurrent protection device protecting the feeder that we are 
tapping into. A 705.11 source connection to a service does not have 
any overcurrent protection on the supply side of the connection, 
thus cannot follow the tap rules, since there would be nothing to 
base your calculations on, with no feeder supply breaker.
The 705.12(A)(3) tap rules will add the feeder supply breaker to 
125% of the inverter current for this calculation.
25-foot tap rule for solar: If the conductor from the connection 
point to the OCPD is less than 25 feet, then the ampacity of that 
conductor between the connection point and the OCPD can be no 
less than 1/3 of the feeder supply breaker plus 125% of the inverter 
current.

reaker]
The reason that we cannot go over 25 feet, is because a long 
wire has more resistance and is less likely to open up the feeder 
supply breaker in case of a fault.
Recall that we are sizing the conductor going from the point 
of connection to the OCPD here. We still would need to apply 
the 705.12(A)(2) feeder rules to make sure that the feeder itself 
Figure 9.6 25-foot tap rule.
Source: Bill Brooks.705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 211
is protected on the load side of the connection point. This is 
because applying the feeder rules and the tap rules together is 
“relevant.”
The examples for the tap rules are related to PV and energy 
storage connections in this book. However, the very same rules 
are used for existing or new load taps and the required size of 
conductors for those taps—there is just no 125% of power source 
current without a power source.
705.12(B) Busbars
Every solar installer’s favorite way to install solar is on a busbar, 
since popping in a breaker on a busbar is often the safest and 
easiest way of installing solar. Since we have currents coming from 
different sources on the busbar, we can be creative where we place 
the solar breakers and often get more out of the busbar than we 
would think at first glance.
We are about to explain how to do some math regarding how 
much current we can backfeed a busbar on a load-side connection. 
In the 2011 and earlier versions of the NEC, we were taught to use 
the inverter backfeed breaker size for our calculations. After the 
2014 NEC we switched over to use 125% of the inverter current in 
most of our calculations. In many cases there will be no difference, 
but here are a few examples of how 125% of inverter current being 
used in the calculation can be beneficial:
• Rounding up to the next common breaker size.
○ Example: If we have a 3kW/240V inverter operating at 
12.5A, we then multiply 12.5A × 1.25 = 15.6A. Since there 
are no 15.6A breakers, we then round up to a 20A breaker. 
If we use the 125% of inverter current in our calculation 
rather than the breaker size, we then get an extra 20A –
15.6A = 4.4A to play with.
• Using a 30A breaker, since a 25A breaker is uncommon.
○ Example: If we are using a 4kW inverter at 240V then 
our inverter current is 4kW/240V = 16.67A and 16.67A × 
1.25 = 20.8A and in this case we can round up to a 25A 
breaker; however, electricians may find it difficult to locate 
a 25A breaker and often use a 30A breaker. It is acceptable 212 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
to use a 30A breaker in this case as long as the conductor is 
large enough to be protected by a 30A breaker and as long 
as the inverter manufacturer allows a 30A breaker to pro￾tect the inverter. In this example 125% of inverter current is 
20.8A and the breaker is 30A, so we have 30A–20.8A = 9.2A 
more of an allowance by using the 125% of inverter current 
rather than the breaker size method.
• Having a few microinverters on a circuit. Often with 
microinverters we do not have the maximum number of 
inverters on a circuit. At times when the microinverter circuit 
has a long way to go to reach the interconnection, the designer 
will place fewer microinverters on a circuit to address voltage 
drop considerations. Other times, we see a few microinverters 
on a circuit, just because it is what fits on the roof.
○ Example: If we have three 250W microinverters on a 
20A breaker at a house, then inverter current would be 
calculated 250W/240V = 1.04A and 125% of the current for 
each inverter would be 1.04A × 1.25 = 1.3A and for three 
inverters 125% of current is 1.3A × 3 = 3.9A. In this case 
the benefit of using 125% of inverter current rather than the 
breaker size is 20A – 3.9A = 16.1A benefit, so in this case it 
can make a big difference.
125% of inverter current is more difficult to explain, but is 
worth it, since it allows for more PV to be installed than in pre￾vious Code cycles. When I do explain it, I often say “the largest 
possible backfeed breaker” instead of “the backfeed breaker,” as 
I used to in 2011.
705.12(B)(1) through (6) are not named and are options and 
not rules (at least when “relevant”); however, since it is so common 
to call 705.12(B)(2) the 120% rule, we will go ahead and let you 
call it the 120% rule. We tried to make everyone change “rule” to 
“option,” but nobody complied, including ourselves.
Some new wording for 705.12(B) Busbars goes:
For power source connections to distribution equipment with 
no specific listing and instructions for combining multiple 
sources, one of the following methods shall be used to deter￾mine the required ampere ratings of the busbars.705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 213
Take note that it says “with no specific listing and instructions for 
combining multiple sources.” This means that if you did have spe￾cial listed equipment for combining multiple sources, then you do 
not have to comply with these 705.12(B) rules (options). Perhaps 
your inverter manufacturer, busbar broker, or panelboard pusher 
has a special listed busbar with instructions how you can have a 
200% rule. Go for it!
705.12(B)(1) 100% Rule (Option)
If 125% of the inverter current plus the main breaker does not 
exceed the rating of the busbar, we can place the inverter breaker 
anywhere on the busbar (it does not have to be on the opposite end 
from the main supply breaker).
For example, if we have a 200A busbar with a 125A main breaker, 
we can place two breakers for two 25A inverters anywhere we want 
on the busbar. We can place up to 75A / 1.25 = 60A of inverters 
anywhere we want on the busbar. We can also do the inverse math 
75A × 0.8 = 60A. 0.8 is the inverse of 1.25. (The 75A comes from 
subtracting the 125A main breaker from the 200A busbar.)
Some installers think that the inverter breaker always must go 
on the opposite side of the busbar from the main breaker. This 
is not true if 125% of the inverter current plus the main breaker 
does not exceed the rating of the busbar. The 100% rule is just an 
option.
Figure 9.7 100% option.

705.12(B)(2) 120% Option (Formerly Known as 120% Rule)
NOTE: We changed the term from 120% “Rule” to 120% 
“Option” in the last version of this book to make a point, so 
we might as well stick with it. This is because so many installers 
are fixated on the 120% restrictions, that it prevents them from 
using some of the better options that have been available since 
the 2014 NEC.
Busbar × 1.2 ≥ Main Breaker + (1.25 × inverter current)
We can exceed the rating of the busbar by up to 20% after 
adding the main supply breaker plus 125% of the inverter current 
if the supply breaker and the solar breaker are on opposite ends of 
the busbar. This opposite end clause was once interpreted in such 
Figure 9.8 705.12(B)(2) 120% option (rule).
Source: Courtesy Kylie Kwiatkowski.705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 215
a way that denied center-fed panelboards from being able to apply 
the 120% option, but as we will soon see in 705.12(B)(4), this is no 
longer the case for dwellings.
Here is the 120% option math from a few different angles:
Main + (1.25 × Inv current) ≤ busbar × 1.2
1.25 × Inv current ≤ (busbar × 1.2) – main
Inv current ≤ ((busbar × 1.2) – main)/1.25 or
Inv current ≤ ((busbar × 1.2) – main) × 0.8 (note: 0.8 =
1/1.25)
Maximum inverter power formula using 120% option:
grid voltage × (((1.2 × busbar) – main) × 0.8) = max 
inverter power
Recall that backfed breakers will have to be located on the 
opposite side of the busbar from the main breaker and that there 
shall be a label saying the following words or equivalent:
WARNING:
POWER SOURCE OUTPUT DO NOT RELOCATE THIS 
OVERCURRENT DEVICE
The reason that we can exceed the busbar rating is because we 
have currents feeding the busbar coming from different directions, 
which makes it easier on the busbar and prevents busbar “hot￾spots” as could happen if the backfeed breaker were put next to 
the main breaker. The 120% option will take some heat off the 
main breaker when power is fed from a spot on the busbar distant 
from the main breaker.
Another thing that people sometimes get confused about 
is thinking that they can only have one backfeed breaker at the 
opposite end. You can have multiple breakers. If you have four 
backfeed breakers, then just make sure they are at the four farthest 
spots from the main breaker. One fun way to exploit the 120% 216 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
rule (option) is to replace your 100A panelboard with a 200A 
panelboard, but keep the 100A main breaker. Then you can add 
a bunch of bidirectional EV breakers and make a lot of money 
selling grid support services to the utility via a virtual power plant 
(VPP) in the near future (we know the future).
705.12(B)(3) Sum of the Branch Breakers Option a.k.a. Sum Rule (See 
figure 9.10 next page)
This option was primarily created so that subpanels could be 
logically used for ac combiner panels without the restrictions of the 
120% option. This is a very simple option that uses the sum of 
the branch circuit breakers in a panel to protect the busbar of the 
panel. These branch circuit breakers can be any combination of 
generation and load breakers. Take note here that this is the only 
load-side connection that uses the ratings of the circuit breakers 
and not 125% of inverter current in the calculations.
Figure 9.9 120% rule (option) with multiple solar breakers acceptable.
Source: Courtesy Kylie Kwiatkowski.705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 217
The easiest way to understand how this rule works is by reading 
the label required to be installed on the distribution equipment 
which reads:
Warning:
This Equipment Fed by Multiple Sources.
Total Rating of All Overcurrent Devices
Excluding Main Supply Overcurrent Device
Shall Not Exceed Ampacity of The Busbar.
In effect, what this “Sum Thing/Rule/Option” is doing is 
protecting the busbar in reverse, by making sure that the sum of 
all the breakers on the load side of the busbar protect the busbar.
If you looked in the main service panel in your house, you 
would likely find that the sum of the branch circuit breakers is 
much more than the main breaker of the busbar is rated for. We 
just do not turn on everything at once, so the main breaker does 
not trip.
Figure 9.10 705.12(B)(3) sum option.
Source: Courtesy Kylie Kwiatkowski.218 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
With the “Sum Rule” we are protecting the busbar by making 
sure that we do not have too much current going from the inverter 
breakers towards the busbar. This rule is conservative if we have 
loads on the busbar.
One application for someone trying to avoid a supply-side 
connection (which is really good for energy storage with backup) 
is to put loads from a main service panel onto a subpanel until 
you have enough space on your main service panel to apply the 
“Sum Option” and add more solar. In Hawaii they are famous 
for getting creative with the Sum Option and they call it the 
Hawaiian Tie-In! Imagine taking a few subpanels and connecting 
them to an all-in-one meter main and applying the Sum Rule 
this way.
Hawaiian Tie-In (See figures 9.11 and 9.12 next page)
There have been some creative and much needed installations 
done connecting to a feeder or using the Sum Option and 
we would like to hand it to the islanders for coming up with 
these. The problem is that it is difficult to make a source 
connection to a service (supply-side connection) with a 
meter-main combo or an all-in-one meter main panelboard, 
so instead we can do what you see here in Figures 9.11
and 9.12.
Another good aspect of using this method is, as we 
add batteries, it can be more advantageous to do a load￾side connection. Supply-side batteries cannot be used for 
backup power.
One way of doing this is visualizing your main panelboard 
as a passthrough: take the existing 100A main panelboard, 
stick a single 100A main breaker coming out of it and then 
feeding a 200A subpanel with that 100A panelboard, and 
have all your loads on the 200A subpanel. You would apply 
the Sum of the Breakers Option rule at the existing main 
panelboard and the 120% rule or 100% rule at the 200A 
subpanel being fed with a 100A breaker.705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 219
705.12(B)(4) Center-Fed 120% Option for Dwellings
Center-fed panelboards are main service panels or subpanels that 
are fed not from one end, but will have loads connected on both 
sides of the main breaker.
Millions of dollars were spent on upgrading main service panels 
before 2016 when we could not apply the 120% rule to center-fed 
panelboards, until there was a TIA (tentative interim amendment) 
in the summer of 2016 modifying the 2014 NEC to allow applying 
the 120% rule to center-fed panelboards.
This TIA means that if you are in some weird place that is 
still using the 2014 NEC, you can now apply the 120% option to 
center-fed panelboards on dwellings!
In the 2017 NEC, the proper way to apply the 120% rule to 
center-fed panelboards is to only connect solar PV to one side of the 
busbar and not both. In the 2020 NEC, it was changed to be allowed 
on both ends! Total from both ends can still only be 120%—nice 
try, if you wanted to put 40-amp PV breakers at both ends of a 
Figure 9.11 Hawaiian tie-in option using sum option.
Source: Courtesy Bill Brooks.220 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
200-amp panel—that is not allowed. Stay tuned for 705.13—you 
will love it if you want to do the million % rule (you just have to be 
able to control your currents).
705.12(B)(5) Feed-Through Conductors/Lugs
Some panelboards have lugs at the bottom of the busbars. If we 
are feeding these feed-through lugs we shall treat the feed-through 
conductors coming off the feed-through lugs as if they were 
feeders according to 705.12(A) Feeders and Feeder Taps. In this 
case, when applying 705.12(A), we will want to protect the feed￾through conductors/feeders as feeders with extra currents that come 
Figure 9.12 Hawaiian tie-in Mai Tai option using sum option.
Source: Courtesy Bill Brooks.705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 221
from 125% of inverter current plus the feeder supply breaker. In 
this case, the feeder supply breaker is the main breaker from the 
panelboard containing the feed-through lugs and this could end up 
causing the feed-though conductors/feeders to be sized rather large 
[1/3 of (main breaker + 125% inverter current)] and limiting you to 
25 feet (or 100 feet in high bay buildings). In this case, we can look 
at the feed-through conductors to be an extension of the busbar.
Another option is putting overcurrent protection at the supply 
end of the feed-through conductors/feeders and using the busbar 
methods in 705.12(B)(1) through 705.12(B)(3).
Recall:
705.12(B)(3)(1) is the 100% Option
705.12(B)(3)(2) is the 120% Option
705.12(B)(3)(3) is the Sum Option
Figure 9.13 705.12(B)(4) center-fed 120% option for dwellings.
Source: Courtesy Kylie Kwiatkowski.222 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
Once we have overcurrent protection by the feed-through lugs, 
then we have a “supply breaker” to work from and applying these 
rules is simpler.
705.12(B)(6) Switchgear, Switchboards and Panelboards Under 
Engineering Supervision
According to the NEC, there are many things that we can do 
under engineering supervision, and connecting to switchgear, 
switchboards, and panelboards is one thing that we can accomplish.
To make these connections, which would typically be on com￾mercial buildings, we have to have an engineer supervise a study of 
available fault currents and perform busbar load calculations.
This option is underutilized. There are many times when an 
engineer is already working on the project and can just sign off on 
something analogous to the 150% rule, or something else safe, if 
you get my drift. Engineers have special powers when it comes to 
sizing busbars.
705.13 Energy Management Systems (EMS) [Formerly Power 
Control Systems (PCS)]
Article 750 is Energy Management Systems and when the 2020 
NEC was made, the stoic geniuses in charge of 750 did not want to 
be involved with these crazy currents going backwards, so we called 
it Power Control Systems in the 2020 NEC, but now there has been 
a change of heart and the 750 people do want to have power over us 
backwards current people, who, by the way, are taking over.
The idea with 705.13 in the 2020 and 2023 NEC is that we can con￾trol the flow of currents on busbars and conductors with smart listed 
electronics, rather than using the rules and options in 705.11 Source 
Connections to a Service and 705.12 Load-Side Source Connections.
705.13 Is the Future!
This is forward thinking and now there are over a dozen 
products that have been listed to the newer PCS requirements 
in UL 1741. With abundant PV, more EVs, and greater 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 223
electricity usage, it is essential that we have means to control 
our currents and to use our huge, and currently underutilized, 
batteries with wheels to be able to support the grid. If you do 
the math, with a typical house that uses 10,000kWh per year, 
the average current is closer to 4A than 5A, although this 
same house is required to have a 200A service. In 10 years, 
when this house has two or three EVs with 250kWh of 
storage, 80% of which is not being utilized on a daily basis 
and the EVs have bidirectional capability, we can then start 
thinking about trickling closer to 5A than 20A from the 
utility. We can export to the utility when it gets hot, cold, 
or whatever the electrical system needs, and we are going to 
be using perhaps double the electricity that we use in 2023 
when we move toward 2033. That means something like 9A 
continuous throughout the year, and we can and will easily 
do this with our 705.13 ingenuity. Besides bidirectional EVs, 
we will see virtual power plants (VPP), which are brokers for 
coordinating with customers and the utility while supporting 
the grid, especially with energy storage. Obviously, we will 
use much more distributed solar, energy storage without 
wheels, 2nd life EV batteries, smart load centers, thermal 
storage of heat and cold, smart appliances, and AI controls 
to tie it all together. We could not properly end this thought, 
without stating that silicon is smarter than us (AI).
2023 NEC 705.13 is one short sentence, which we will display here:
An EMS in accordance with 750.30 shall be permitted to limit 
current and loading on busbars and conductors supplied by the 
output of one or more interconnected electric power produc￾tion or energy storage sources.
Since 705.13 now sends us to 750.30, it is time to dive into the 750 
EMS zone…
750 Energy Management Systems is a short article and contains 
750.30 Load Management, which is slightly misleading, since solar 
and such is the anti-load!224 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
Here is a little outline of 750.30:
750.30 Load Management
750.30(A) Load Shedding and Controls
750.30(A)(1)–(5) Lists loads to not shed, such as emergency 
and fire things
750.30(B) Disconnection of Power
750.30(B)(1)–(5) Lists loads to not disconnect, such as 
elevators and essentials
750.30(C) Capacity of Branch Circuit, Feeder, or Service
750.30(C)(1) Current Setpoint
750.30(C)(1)(1) Calculation in 220.70 Energy Management 
Systems (EMSs) (new) (in Article 220 Branch-Circuit, 
Feeder, and Service Calculations)
750.30(C)(1)(2) Maximum source current per￾mitted by EMS
750.30(C)(2) System Malfunction
750.30(C)(3) Settings (at least one of the following)
750.30(C)(3)(1) Located behind removable and seal￾able cover
750.30(C)(3)(2) Located behind cover that requires tool
750.30(C)(3)(3) Located behind locked door accessible to 
qualified personnel
750.30(C)(3)(4) Password protected
750.30(C)(3)(5) Software with password
750.30(C)(4) Marking
750.30(C)(4)(1) Max Current Setting
750.30(C)(4)(2) Date of Calculation
750.30(C)(4)(3) Identification of Loads and Sources with 
Current Limiting
750.30(C)(4)(4) Wording or equivalent “The setting 
for the EMS current limiting feature shall not be 
bypassed”
As we can see from the outline, 750.30 is very load-centric; how￾ever, there are EMS rules that we must follow, such as current 
setpoints, making the EMS only programmable by qualified 
people. Marking and labeling requirements are obvious when 
reading the outline above. We do not want Joe homeowner coming 
along and increasing the current on his busbar, which can cause 
Joe firefighter to make a special trip to save his family.705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 225
Diagrams Using 705.13 Energy Management Systems
Here are a few ways to take advantage of this EMS piece 
of Code. See figures 9.14 and 9.15.
In a way, the 2023 NEC for interconnected electric power produc￾tion sources is less specific on 705.13 than the 2020 NEC version, 
since in the 2020 NEC it was written by renewable energy people 
and now that 705.13 just refers us to 750.30 EMS, the focus of 
NEC 750 EMS is on loads. Whenever something new happens, it 
takes a while for the wrinkles to be ironed out, but the intention 
and idea are the same.

In the 2023 NEC, “Power Control Systems” are only mentioned 
twice in two Informational Notes, one in 705.6 Equipment Approval
and the other in 705.13 EMS. The 705.13 Informational Note tells 
us that a listed power control system (PCS) is a type of an EMS that 
can monitor multiple power sources and control currents on busbars 
and conductors. The 705.6 Informational Note mentions that PCSs 
commonly have interactive functions.
An EMS needs to be listed and evaluated to control the output 
of power production sources, energy storage systems, and other 
equipment. The EMS will limit currents on busbars and conductors 
supplied by the EMS.
This means that we can use electronics (think of that trendy 
acronym AI) to control the currents flowing around the circuits 
and busbars. Now you can theoretically connect PV, an energy

storage system (ESS), a bidirectional electric vehicle, and load 
controls so that you can supply as much as 400A while having a 
100A service! Perhaps you need a fast charge on your new EV, so 
you take 200A from your ESS, 50A from your PV, 50A from your 
utility, and another 100A from your old EV to get 400A while only 
drawing 50A from the utility.
The 2020 NEC explicitly stated that on the load side of the ser￾vice disconnecting means any currents not monitored by the PCS 
[EMS] shall comply with 705.12 Load-Side Source Connections. 
This is no longer explicitly stated in the 2023 NEC but it is implied 
in the requirements of 705.28.
The 2020 NEC also stated that if the PCS [EMS] is connected 
on the supply side of the service disconnecting means as with 
705.11 Source Connections, then PCS [EMS] will monitor currents 
on service conductors to prevent overload of service conductors. 
This is also no longer explicitly stated but should be implied. We 
just need to use common sense here which is in very short supply 
these days with all the supply-chain issues.
This is a basic idea that ensures that the settings of the EMS 
are capable of monitoring and controlling the power sources to 
a subpanel or conductor within the current ratings or ampacity 
of the equipment. Where a EMS does not have control of all the 
sources feeding a subpanel (e.g., the utility feed), then the settings 
on the EMS must prevent more than the rated current to be fed 
to the subpanel. Therefore, if a 100-amp panel is being fed by PV 
and ESS via an EMS and the current begins to exceed the ratings 
of the 100-amp panel, then the EMS would have to reduce the 
PV and ESS power causing the 100-amp feeder breaker from the 
utility to trip. This scenario would actually only happen in an 
overloaded panel.
Another principle is that the EMS shall function as an OCPD 
or work with other OCPDs and the rating of an OCPD for a device 
for a single power source controlled by an EMS shall not exceed 
the rating of the busbar or conductor.
This principle means that, although an EMS may be control￾ling the current, we can never connect a single power source to a 
busbar that is larger than the busbar current rating.
750.30(C)(3) Settings is much like 240.6(C), which we used in the 
2020 NEC.228 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
In other words, when we are using an EMS to prevent overcurrents, 
we need to make sure that some burger flipper does not start 
messing with the settings to get the deep fryer working after it 
keeps tripping the breaker. An analogy would be how people in 
the 1970s used to put a penny under the fuse since the fuse kept 
blowing. It could get hot—and we are not talking 2°C (3.6°F) of 
global warming here, we are talking about flaming Venus 911 hot!
705.20 Source Disconnecting Means
Ungrounded conductors from power production sources must 
have a means for disconnecting. This applies to most anything in 
the NEC and was already covered in Section 690.13 on page 79.
One notable change in 705.20 is that in the 2023 NEC, it was 
clarified that a single disconnecting means shall be permitted to dis￾connect multiple power sources from conductors or other systems. 
Perhaps this could be the SolarEdge StorEdge disconnect that 
works for the PV array and the battery, all with one twist of a knob.
705.25 Wiring Methods
The wiring methods here are mostly duplicative of what we see in 
690.31 Wiring Methods, which refers a lot to Chapter 3 Wiring 
Methods and Materials, and we have already covered this, begin￾ning on page 100 of this book.
705.28 Circuit Sizing and Current
Circuit sizing and current for PV systems is covered in 690.8 Circuit 
Sizing and Current and covered beginning on page 34 of this book. 
Additionally, you will find a lot of this information and how to use 
this information when we cover wire sizing in Chapter 12 of this 
book. Circuit sizing and current for PV systems and other loads 
or power sources throughout the Code follows the same rules and 
theory for the most part.
New in 2023 there is mention of EMS (Energy Management 
Systems) in 705.28 and these systems can control currents, so we 
use the “current setpoint” for our EMS controlled current value.
Most of the time an interactive inverter ac grounded con￾ductor (neutral) does not carry current and is just there for 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 229
instrumentation, voltage detection, and phase detection. In this 
case, and going along with the Code, we use Section 250.102 
Grounded Conductor, Bonding Conductors, and Jumpers to size 
the grounded conductor, which sends us to Table 250.102(C)(1) 
Grounded Conductor, Main Bonding Jumper, System Bonding 
Jumper, and Supply-Side Bonding Jumper for Alternating Current 
Systems. In this table we can select the non-current-carrying 
grounded conductor based on the size of the current-carrying con￾ductor. For example, a 1/0 copper ungrounded conductor calls out 
for a 6 AWG (or larger) grounded conductor. This is not special 
for renewable energy but is mentioned in 705.28(C)(2) Neutral 
Conductor Used Solely for Instrumentation, Voltage Detection, or 
Phase Detection.
Some inverters, from small Enphase inverters to other very 
large inverters, do not even have an ac grounded conductor.
705.30 Overcurrent Protection
This lines up very closely with 690.9 Overcurrent Protection on 
page 49 of this book and Article 240 Overcurrent Protection. 
You can also refer to Chapter 12 Wire Sizing in this book 
to see how to select overcurrent protection devices. 705.30 
reminds us that 240.4(B) Overcurrent Devices Rated 800A or 
Less allows us (with exceptions) to round up the OCPD to next 
higher ampacity above the conductor’s ampacity if the resulting 
OCPD is below 800A. This is the step in wire sizing that is not 
completely logical at face value and we have an example in 
Chapter 12 where the ampacity of the OCPD is greater than 
the ampacity of the conductor that it is protecting on page 293. 
Having an OCPD with a greater ampacity than the conductor 
is not common.
240.4(C) Overcurrent Devices Rated over 800A tells us the 
opposite of 240.4(B), that we cannot have an overcurrent device 
that is greater than the conductor ampacity it is protecting.
Here is a summary of this section:
705.30(A) Circuit and Equipment
Power source output conductors shall have overcurrent protection 
from all sources.230 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
705.30(B) Overcurrent Device Ratings
125% of maximum (continuous) current (typical throughout 
the NEC).
705.30(C) Marking (used to be in 705.12)
Equipment containing OCPD shall be marked to indicate power 
sources
705.30(D) Suitable for Backfeed (used to be in 705.12)
Fused disconnects (unless otherwise marked) are considered suit￾able for backfeed. Even circuit breakers marked line and load are 
suitable for backfeed if specifically rated.
705.30(E) Fastening (used to be in 705.12)
Interactive inverters do not require additional fastener normally 
required by 408.36(D) (which is required for stand-alone circuits).
705.30(F) Transformers
Primary side is considered the largest source of fault current (grid 
side). For more on transformers see page 60.
705.32 Ground-Fault Protection
Interactive systems shall be installed on the supply side of ground￾fault protection equipment.
705.32 Exception (connecting to the load side of ground-fault protection)
If there is ground-fault protection from all ground-fault current 
sources, then it is acceptable to connect to the load side of ground￾fault protection equipment.
Discussion: It is difficult to protect against ground-faults if there 
are current sources on each side of ground-fault protection. Many 
solar professionals do not bother trying to connect on the load 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 231
side of ground-fault protection. All new services of 1000A and 
larger, built after 2002, are required to include ground-fault pro￾tection. Most manufacturers of these systems are accustomed to 
providing documentation that their detection circuits can handle 
backfed power from a generator (like an interactive inverter) on 
the load side of the ground-fault protector.
705.40 Loss of Primary Power Source
We are not allowed to feed the grid, when the grid (primary power 
source) is down!
Discussion: UL 1741 inverters are safe with regards to not 
feeding the grid when the grid is down, a.k.a., anti-islanding.
Since Article 705 includes other sources of power being 
connected to the grid, including big diesel generators, there is a 
provision in 705 to require conductors to be disconnected auto￾matically from the primary power source.
Interactive inverters, however, will stay connected and monitor 
the grid-connection and export power five minutes after a good 
clean grid power source is indicated. Interactive inverters cannot 
feed the grid when the grid is down. No exceptions. It cannot 
happen and it is certified to prevent such an occurrence.
Multimodal inverters can power loads when the grid is down, 
and this is done with a separate output circuit coming out of the 
inverter that is not connected to the utility grid, or with a microgrid 
interconnect device (MID). Multimodal inverters can have mul￾tiple (usually two) outputs that operate in different modes, such 
as an interactive mode output and a stand-alone (island) mode 
output. Many newer multimode inverters have a single output 
and perform anti-islanding with a separate microgrid intercon￾nect device (MID). See Island Mode Definition on page 266 in 
Chapter 11, or in Article 100 Definitions.
Chuck Norris Exception: When Chuck Norris’s PV system 
disconnects from the grid, the grid goes into island mode. 
Source: www.chucknorrisfacts.net
Discussion: According to UL 1741, listed interactive inverters 
will stop exporting power when one phase is down.
Other than interactive inverters must disconnect all phases 
when a phase is down.232 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
It is not mentioned here in 705.40, but it is acceptable to have 
single-phase inverters connected to a 3-phase service and if a phase 
is down that is not connected to a single-phase inverter, then the 
single-phase inverter is allowed to export power on the good 
phases.
Often single-phase microinverters are connected to 3-phase ser￾vices via a cable that rotates the phases by connecting different 
inverters to different phases.
705.45 Unbalanced Interconnections
705.45(A) Single Phase
Single-phase inverters (and ac modules) shall be connected to 3-
phase systems in order to limit unbalanced voltages to not more 
than 3%.
Single-Phase Inverters on 3-Phase Services 
Just as loads can be strategically placed to limit imbalances on 
3-phase busbars, so can single-phase inverters, but with reverse 
logic as with loads. If a building is out of balance and inverters 
are placed on the phases with lower voltage, which are the most 
heavily loaded phases, the inverters will reduce the utility load 
on those phases and help raise the voltage by sending power 
in a reverse direction. The result is that the imbalance of the 
service is reduced and the neutral current also goes down. 
Inverters cause voltage rise on a backfed busbar. Remember 
that with an energy storage system, your electronic power con￾verter (inverter/charger) is not just a source, but also a load 
when charging, so it can cause voltage to rise and drop.
It is conceivable that someone could invent an inverter that 
could balance the voltages of different phases by injecting 
power where there is a phase with less voltage. This could 
even happen at night.
It is normal to have more loads on one phase than another 
and bringing along smart inverters can reduce this imbal￾ance, so we can be the solution, not the problem.705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 233
705.45(B) Three Phase
• Three-phase inverters (and ac modules) shall have all phases 
de-energize upon unbalanced voltage in a single phase unless 
the inverter is designed so that significant unbalances will not 
result.
Discussion: UL 1741-listed inverters will automatically discon￾nect with large imbalances. There are new inverter standards, 
which have been adopted in California at the time of the writing 
of this book, such as UL 1741 SA, which will change the way 
inverters help support the utility grid, and other standards that 
may have been released while you were reading this book. These 
new developing standards address a new level of saturation of 
distributed generation on the grid and can differ based upon where 
you live. Exciting times!
Part II Microgrid Systems (Includes DC Microgrids in 
2023 NEC)
Dc microgrids were formerly covered in Article 712 in the 2020 
and 2017 NEC, but now they are all covered here. Not very many 
people were using Article 712 and the theories are the same for dc 
and ac in this case and most cases.
705.50 System Operation (Microgrid Systems)
Microgrids can operate in interactive mode with a primary power 
source and can disconnect from that primary power source (usu￾ally utility) and then operate in island mode.
Microgrids can include PV, wind, energy storage systems, and 
even internal combustion engine (ICE) generators (obviously 
powered with clean green recycled organic homegrown sustainably 
harvested virgin olive oil biodiesel).
705.60 Primary Power Source Connection (Microgrid Systems)
Connections to primary power sources (grid) shall comply with:
• 705.11 Supply-Side Source Connections (page 196)234 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
• 705.12 Load-Side Source Connections (page 203)
• 705.13 Energy Management Systems (formerly Power Control 
Systems) (page 222)
705.65 Reconnection to Primary Power Source (Microgrid 
Systems)
Reconnection shall be provided with necessary equipment to 
establish a synchronous connection. Interactive and multimode 
inverters all provide this service.
705.70 Microgrid Interconnect Devices (MID) (MID definition 
on page 267)
See page 267 of this book for the definition of MID. Many multi￾mode inverters have always had a MID internally, which would 
disconnect from the grid and provide backup power to protected 
loads. Many newer MIDs are external to the inverter and signal 
the inverter to go into island mode when the grid goes down.
MIDs are/must:
(1) Required between microgrid system and primary power source
(2) Be listed or field labeled
(3) Have OCPD to protect from all sources
705.76 Microgrid Control Systems (MCS) (New in 2023 NEC)
MCSs shall:
(1) Coordinate interactions between multiple power sources
(2) Be listed, field labeled, or designed under engineering 
supervision
(3) Monitor and control power production and quality
(4) Monitor and control transitions with external primary power 
source
705 Part III Interconnected Systems Operating in Island Mode 
(New in 2023 NEC)
Here is some Article 705 history. The 2011 NEC 690.64 point of 
connection requirements were consolidated into 705.12(D) in the 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 235
2014 NEC. The 2014 NEC Article 705 was organized in three 
parts, Part I General, Part II Utility-Interactive Inverters and Part 
III Generators. In the 2017 NEC, 705 had the same three parts. In 
the 2020 NEC, Article 705 was reorganized into two parts, Part 
I General and Part II Microgrid Systems. Now in the 2023 NEC, we 
added another Part III again, in addition to the same parts we had 
in the 2020 NEC, which is short and called Part III Interconnected 
Systems Operating in Island Mode. This last new part simply 
restates the basics of Article 710, Stand-Alone Systems, to clarify 
that a multi-mode system that switches back and forth between 
grid-tied and islanded is NOT a stand-alone system anymore. 
When disconnected from the grid, it is an interconnected system 
operating in island mode. If you think this distinction is silly, or 
a waste of paper, you should sit in on the hours of discussion it 
took to get to that understanding—then you will really understand 
what wasted time looks like.
705.80 Power Source Capacity
When operating in island (stand-alone) mode the capacity shall be 
the sum of all of the power source maximum currents.
Discussion: It is often confusing when battery people talk about 
capacity, since Ah (ampere-hours) are considered capacity for 
batteries; however, in most cases capacity is expressed in power 
(watts). In this case it says we are expressing capacity in current as 
it is in Article 220.
Reminder: to get dc power we multiply current times voltage 
(Pdc = I × V); to get ac power we multiply current times voltage 
times the power factor (Pac = I × V × p.f.). An inverter is a volt￾amp machine similar to an ac transformer. Proper rating of an 
inverter is in volt-amps rather than watts. If the power factor is 
low, the inverter cannot source any more volt-amps than when it 
is operating at unity power factor (p.f. = 1, no power factor loss). 
When we say we have a 7.6 kW inverter, what we really mean is 
that we have a 7.6 kVA inverter. Since grid-tied inverters operate 
at unity power factor most of the time, it is not inaccurate to 
say that the inverter is a 7.6 kW inverter most of the time. When 
the inverter is in grid-support mode and required to source or 
sink VARs, the inverter produces less power and no more than 
7.6 kVA.236 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources
Alternating Confusion (For Non-Engineers)
kVA is called apparent power
VARs are called reactive power
Power is called real power
PF = power factor
With alternating current, current and voltage are often out 
of phase with each other and peaking at different times. Real 
power has to do with current multiplied by voltage instant￾aneously and is going to be equal to or less than apparent 
power. Apparent power multiplied by power factor equals 
real power.
Since ac nominal operating voltage is a given (either 120, 208, 240, 
277, or 480Vac), then the actual capacity can be expressed by how 
much current the circuit actually draws. This is also helpful since it 
determines the size of the wire based on the made-up NEC word 
of “ampacity” which is the capacity of a wire to carry current at or 
below its voltage rating.
705.81 Voltage and Frequency Control
Voltage and frequency shall be supplied compatible with loads. 
This is an “apple pie and motherhood” statement that simply 
says that whatever power source we use, it must be compatible. 
The inverter and microgrid standards state exactly what is meant 
by compatibility. The NEC is all about safety. Compatibility is 
important so that equipment does not blow up, but the NEC is 
not the place to define compatibility, since that subject is complex. 
What we can say is that if a power source causes a healthy piece of 
electrical equipment to catch on fire, we should question whether 
the power source was truly compatible.
End-of-Chapter Thoughts
At this point, we have covered the meat and bones* of PV and the 
NEC with Articles 690 and 705. Rather than going meat-and-bones 705 Interconnected Power Production Sources 237
level and creating a book that would be too heavy to carry and 
cover many things that are not specific to PV systems, we will go 
broth level on the rest of the Code.
*Solar planet-loving vegetarians: have no worries, the meat and 
bones used to make this book are actually soy-based, 
simulated meat products. Yum!DOI: 10.4324/9781003189862-11
10 Storage Articles
As PV systems grow at an exponential pace and head towards the 
goal of someday saturating the grid, energy storage systems are a 
natural fit for bottling sunlight for nighttime photon usage (a.k.a. 
midnight solar).
This chapter will cover:
Article 706 Energy Storage Systems
Article 710 Stand-Alone Systems
Article 480 Stationary Standby Batteries
Article 625 Electric Vehicle Power Transfer System
With energy storage being in vogue at all the solar conferences 
this decade (or millennium), we will take a ride on the Article 706 
Energy Storage Systems train and see where that track crosses 
paths with the Article 710 Stand-Alone Systems express at an inter￾section with the Article 480 Stationary Standby Batteries steamer.
Batteries and Energy Storage
In the 2014 NEC and earlier, Article 480 Storage Batteries was 
used along with Section 690.10 Stand-Alone Systems and 690 Part 
VIII Storage Batteries for designing and installing energy storage 
for stand-alone PV systems. Much of that order was changed in 
the 2017 NEC. As usual, much of the change is with the organiza￾tion of the NEC, rather than changing the installation drastically.
When work started on Article 706, the intention was to take 
the information from Articles 480 and 690 and get rid of those Storage Articles 239
sections. Somewhere along the way, the lead-acid folks decided 
they still needed Article 480 even though it is in the wrong chapter 
of the NEC (batteries do not belong in Chapter 4 in the first 
place) and 480 is no longer needed. The focus for field installations 
should be on Article 706 for energy storage systems that are used 
in and around utility services. The title and scope of Article 480 
has changed to better represent the types of systems for which they 
are used. Article 480 is now called Stationary Standby Batteries 
as this equipment is mostly used by the telecom industry or for 
backup power in substations.
Scopes of Article 480 Stationary Standby Batteries and Article 
706 Energy Storage Systems:
• Article 480 scope applies to all stationary standby installations 
of storage batteries.
• Article 706 scope applies to all permanently installed energy 
storage systems above 1 kWh.
As we can imagine, the scopes cross paths and both art￾icles may be considered in battery systems with stored energy 
above 1 kWh.
Article 480, formerly known as Storage Batteries, has been in 
the NEC longer than we have been alive (Thomas Edison was in 
his prime) and Article 706 Energy Storage Systems is two Code￾cycles old. As you read Article 480, you will realize that much of 
the material is related to good old time-tested and reliable (and 
sweet-tasting) lead-acid battery technologies. A new Informational 
Note in Article 480 seeks to differentiate between equipment for 
Article 480 and for Article 706.
Informational Note No. 1: See Article 706 for installations that 
do not meet the definition of stationary standby batteries.
To understand this note, we must look at the new definition in 
Article 100.
Definition: Battery, Stationary Standby. (Stationary Standby 
Battery)
A battery that spends the majority of the time on continuous 
float charge or in a high state of charge, in readiness for a dis￾charge event. (CMP-13)240 Storage Articles
Informational Note: Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) 
batteries are an example that falls under this definition.
While it is likely that confusion will still occur between Articles 
480 and 706, there is far more clarity in the 2023 NEC about which 
article to use for various applications. For purposes of this book, 
we will focus on applications covered by Article 706.
As we can see by reading Article 706, it focuses more on 
new modern technologies including, but not limited to, chem￾ical batteries. Article 706 will cover the higher voltage lithium￾derivative battery modules that are being sold, flywheel storage, 
capacitor energy storage, and compressed air storage. Article 480 
will stick to standby battery applications that have been around for 
over 100 years.
Article 706 covers the energy storage “system.” The International 
Residential Code (IRC) requires all energy storage systems used 
for one- and two-family dwellings to be listed to UL 9540. It is 
interesting to note that, at the time of this writing, there are still no 
UL 9540 listed lead-acid based ESS and that the IRC requires UL 
9540. Some would say that this means you cannot install lead-acid 
batteries in a house anymore while others will claim that a house 
can have a stationary standby battery which is not considered an 
energy storage system. Clearly semantics will remain mirky on this 
issue. Ultimately, the local jurisdiction will have to decide whether 
or not to allow standby batteries in dwellings. Outside a dwelling 
is a completely different issue and is not specifically addressed in 
the IRC.
We will notice that there are many reoccurring themes in 
Article 706 from within the material in Articles 690 and 705. 
This includes having separate energy sources with the ability to 
operate in parallel and the requirements of disconnecting systems 
from each other.
An outline of noteworthy NEC energy storage articles, parts, 
and sections follows. Italics are author comments. We will start and 
emphasize Article 706 and end with Article 480, which is of less 
importance. The most important thing you can learn about Article 
480 is how to explain that we generally do not use it. We will cover 
706 first, since it is all important, and then cover 710 before we get 
to 480 and finish off with 625.Storage Articles 241
Article 706 Energy Storage Systems
706 Part I General
706.1 Scope
Article 706 applies to permanently installed energy storage systems 
over 1 kWh.
It is interesting that for the scope they also use the units of 3.6MJ, 
which equals 1 kWh. A joule is a watt second, so, since there are 
3,600 seconds in an hour, 3.6 million joules = 1 kWh. You do not 
see as many people using joules in this industry as you do in physics 
classes. People with megajoules are rich and flashy dressers.
706.4 System Requirements (marking and labeling)
ESS shall be provided with a nameplate that is plainly visible and 
includes the following:
(1) ESS manufacturer’s name or identifying information
(2) Frequency
(3) Number of phases (ac only of course)
(4) Rating in kW or kVA
(5) Available fault current at ESS output terminals
(6) Max output and input current at terminals
(7) Max output and input voltage at terminals
(8) Utility interactive capability
As we can see here, all the markings are not always required, since 
it is possible to have a dc energy storage system which would have 
no frequency or number of phases. It is also interesting to note 
that the power characteristics are required, but there are no energy 
characteristics required. It is nice to see that we do not have to 
calculate Ah! Now, when someone talks about Ah, you know they 
are trying to say that they have been around for a while and are 
probably a grumpy Article 480 diehard.
706.5 Listing
Energy storage systems must be listed!242 Storage Articles
This means UL 9540 and is not something you can make in your 
garage.
706.6 Multiple Systems
Multiple ESS can be on the same premises.
You may have to go to the residential, building, and fire codes to 
see different restrictions.
706.7 Commissioning and Maintenance
Since the NEC is not a maintenance code, we should not be 
looking in the NEC for maintenance requirements, we should be 
looking in the fire codes. Perhaps having these requirements in the 
NEC is a mistake since there is no way to enforce maintenance 
with a construction code.
706.7(A) Commissioning says that we need to commission ESS 
upon installation, but it does not apply to 1- and 2-family 
dwellings.
706.7(B) Maintenance tells us to keep our ESS maintained with 
written records and does not apply to 1- and 2-family dwellings.
706.9 Maximum Voltage
The maximum voltage is the rated input and output voltages on 
the nameplate or listing of the ESS. This is typically an ac voltage 
since it is coming out of the energy storage system.
706 Part II Disconnecting Means
706.15 Disconnecting Means
There are many similarities here when we look at 690.13 PV System 
Disconnecting Means.
706.15(A) ESS Disconnecting Means
Means to disconnect ESS from all wiring, power systems, and 
equipment shall be provided.Storage Articles 243
706.15(B) Location and Control
ESS shall be readily accessible and comply with at least one of the 
following:
(1) Located within ESS
(2) Located within sight and within 10 feet of ESS
(3) Lockable in the open position (think lockout-tagout)
Where remote controls of a disconnecting means are not within 
sight of the ESS, the location of the controls shall be marked on 
the disconnecting means.
Emergency Shutdown System: For 1- and 2-family dwellings, 
an initiation device readily accessible outside of the building shall 
plainly indicate whether on or off and when initiated (off) the ESS 
will stop exporting power.
Discussion: This is THE MOST IMPORTANT change in 
Article 706 in the 2023 NEC. Emergency Shutdown System sounds 
similar to 690.12 Rapid Shutdown for PV Systems on Buildings.
It is possible to have the same “initiation device” control both 
the PV Rapid Shutdown and ESS Emergency Shutdown if it is 
marked for both. This is good for firefighters! This is also good for 
installers. The way the 2020 NEC is written, it is unclear whether 
the emergency disconnect, discussed in 706.15(B), is required to 
be a load-break switch or not. Without that detail in the 2020 
NEC, and with the detail in the 2023, it is reasonable to make the 
case that the language of the 2023 NEC informs the language of 
the 2020 NEC as to what was intended. Having a shutdown con￾trol for an ESS is far easier to install than an external load-break 
switch.
706.15(C) Notification and Marking
ESS disconnecting means shall indicate whether on or off and be 
marked “ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM DISCONNECT.”
Disconnecting means shall also be marked to indicate:
(1) Nominal ESS voltage (such as 240Vac for your home)
(2) Available fault current (not much since typically coming from an 
inverter or dc-to-dc converter)244 Storage Articles
(3) Arc-flash label (more fault currents come from utility connection 
than ESS inverter)
(4) Date calculation performed (another throwback from 
Article 480)
1- and 2-family dwellings can omit points (2) through (4), so 
they only need nominal voltage.
• Battery equipment suppliers can provide fault current 
information.
• NFPA 70E Standards for Electrical Safety in the Workplace has 
requirements for arc-flash labels.
• Unlike PV, which is current-limited, ESS can have exces￾sive short-circuit currents which can be more dangerous with 
regards to arc-flashes; however, with electronics on the output 
of many UL 9540 listed ESS, we often do not see the currents 
like we did when we were connected to Article 480 style 
storage batteries.
If the line and load terminals of the disconnect may be energized 
in the open position, then we need this familiar label:
WARNING
ELECTRIC SHOCK HAZARD
TERMINALS ON THE LINE AND LOAD
SIDES MAY BE ENERGIZED IN THE OPEN POSITION
706.15(D) Partitions Between Components
Where circuits from the terminals of an ESS go through a wall, 
floor, or ceiling, then a readily accessible disconnect shall be 
provided within sight of the ESS.
706.15(E) Disconnecting Means for Batteries (New in 2023 NEC)
If battery is subject to field servicing and separate from ESS elec￾tronics, then all of 706.15(E)(1) through (E)(4) shall apply.
Discussion: Many batteries that are separate from the inverter 
have ESS electronics and are not subject to these rules. Popular 
examples would be the LG Chem RESU and SolarEdge batteries.Storage Articles 245
706.15(E)(1) DISCONNECTING MEANS
Disconnecting means shall be provided for all ungrounded 
conductors, which is readily accessible and in sight of battery.
706.15(E)(2) Disconnection of Series Battery Circuits
Battery circuits shall be able to be broken into 240V dc or less 
circuits for maintenance. Non-load-break bolted or plug-in 
disconnects are acceptable.
706.15(E)(3) Remote Activation
If remote disconnect is out of sight from battery, then disconnect 
shall be capable of being locked in the open position.
706.15(E)(4) Notification
This is the same marking of nominal voltage, available fault current, 
arc-flash, and date of calculation requirements as 706.15(C) on pages 
164 and 243, but without the 1- and 2-family dwelling exception.
706.16 Connection to Energy Sources
706.16 is disposable.
This whole section is unnecessary and duplicative since 
the requirements of Article 705 always apply when an ESS 
is connected to another energy source. The confusion prob￾ably comes from those ESS heretics who believe that ESS 
are not a source of energy themselves. These heretics believe 
that ESS are not a source—only a storage device. Regardless 
of their heretical beliefs, a charged battery looks like, quacks 
like, and in every way operates like other energy sources. 
Since 706.16 is referring to ESS connected to other sources, 
Article 705 clearly applies. Lastly, 706.16(F) Stand-Alone 
Operation either is using the wrong language and reference 
or does not belong in this section. If the intent is to talk 
systems operating in island mode, that term should be used. 
If the intent is to talk about stand-alone mode, then it needs 246 Storage Articles
to be in a section other than 706.16. The best result is for the 
2026 NEC to delete all of 706.16 except 706.16(F) and call 
the new 706.16 simply Stand-Alone Operation. Incidentally, 
if a battery is never connected to an energy source, we call 
that a disposable battery since it does not get recharged. It 
is clear that Article 706 is not intended to cover disposable 
batteries.
706.16 says to comply with all of 706.16(A) through (F) below
(A) Source Disconnect—If a disconnect has multiple sources, 
then it shall shut off all sources when in the off position.
(B) Identified Interactive Equipment—If we operate in parallel to 
ac sources, then equipment shall be listed and identified as 
interactive.
(C) Loss of Interactive System Power—If loss of primary power 
source, then interactive inverter circuit shall anti-island as 
described in 705.40 Loss of Primary Power Source (page 241).
(D) Unbalanced Interconnections—If unbalanced inter￾connection, then shall comply with 705.45 Unbalanced 
Interconnections (page 232).
(E) Other Energy Sources—If connected to other energy sources, 
then shall be in accordance with 705.12 Interconnected 
Power Production Sources.
(F) Stand-Alone Operation—This section says that if the ESS can 
operate as stand-alone, then we follow 710.15 General (710 
is Stand-Alone Systems). However, this language is outdated 
and not consistent with the changes made in the 2023 NEC. 
If this section remains, then the heading should be “Island 
Operation” and state that if the ESS can operate in island 
mode, then follow 702.4(A) System Capacity. Thanks for the 
additional confusion, Code Making Panel 13—they will figure 
it out eventually.Storage Articles 247
706 Part III Installation Requirements
706.20 General (of ESS)
706.20(A) Ventilation
Ventilation shall be appropriate for battery technology (this repeats 
Article 480). Ventilation can be done according to manufacturer’s 
instructions. Lithium-ion battery systems require a battery man￾agement system (BMS) to prevent overcharging and they do not 
make hydrogen gas, like lead-acid batteries. Unless a lithium-ion 
ESS manufacturer states that ventilation must be provided, it is gen￾erally not required since sealed batteries generally do not require 
ventilation.
706.20(B) Dwelling Units
An ESS shall not exceed 100Vdc between conductors or to ground, 
unless during routine maintenance live parts are not accessible and 
then 600Vdc shall be acceptable.
Many packaged ESS have dc voltages over 100V and have live parts 
that are not accessible during routine maintenance, which are hidden 
in the ESS. Lithium-ion batteries cannot be maintained so there is no 
reason to open a lithium ESS—unless you watched a YouTube video 
that taught you how to make your own Tesla Powerwall.
706.20(C) Spaces about ESS
706.20(C)(1) GENERAL
Repeats Article 480.10(C) in saying Section 110.26 Spaces about 
Electrical Equipment and 110.34 Work Space and Guarding.
706.20(C)(2) SPACE BETWEEN COMPONENTS
Spacing is done in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. 
After all it was tested and listed that way.
706.21 Directory (Identification of Power Sources)
Labels shall be in accordance with 110.21(B) see page 269.248 Storage Articles
706.21(A) Facilities with Utility Services and ESS
Plaques in accordance with 705.10 Identification of Power Sources
(Interconnected Power Production Sources, pages 160, 169 and 194).
706.21(B) Facilities with Stand-Alone Systems
Plaques in accordance with 710.10 Identification of Power Sources
(Stand-Alone Systems, pages 160, 169 and 194).
706 Part IV Circuit Requirements
The circuit requirements are very much the same throughout 
the NEC, especially when calculating a wire size for a renewable 
energy system.
Here are a few things to take note of regarding current and 
an ESS.
• 706.30(A)(1) Nameplate-Rated Circuit Current—Oftentimes an 
ESS will charge and discharge through the same conductors. If 
the charge and discharge rated currents are different, the greater 
current shall be used in wire sizing—makes sense.
• 706.30(A)(2) Inverter Output Circuit Current—Continuous 
current.
• 706.30(A)(3) Inverter Input Circuit Current—If the input of an 
inverter is connected to a battery, then the battery voltage will 
go up and down depending on the state of charge of the battery 
and the load put on the battery. We consider the lowest voltage 
to determine the highest current, since voltage × current = power 
and when voltage goes down, current goes up. We will discuss 
this further when we see it again soon on page 250 as we cover 
Article 710 Stand-Alone Systems.
• 706.30(A)(4) Inverter Utilization Output Circuit Current—This 
is the stand-alone circuit and is based on continuous current 
(not surge current).
• 706.30(A)(5) DC to DC Converter Output Current—Continuous 
current from dc-to-dc converter.
For more wire sizing, see Chapter 12 wire sizing, starting on page 
287. The NEC repeats itself many times for wire sizing, and in this 
book we will be more practical and efficient.Storage Articles 249
• 706.31 Overcurrent Protection / 706.31(A) Circuits and 
Equipment—Circuits shall be protected at the source of 
overcurrents. Listed ESS have integral fault protection, so the 
dangerous fault currents are from the utility.
• 706.33 Charge Control / 706.33(A) General—We must have a 
means to control the charge and adjustable charge control is 
only accessible to qualified persons. Listed ESS will have battery 
management systems to prevent overcharging.
• 706.33(B) Diversion Charge Controller—Diversion charge 
controllers are rare these days; however, if used there are 
requirements for oversizing diversion load and conductors. A 
diversion load is used to utilize otherwise wasted energy when 
the batteries are fully charged.
• 706.33(B)(1) Sole Means of Regulating Charge—We cannot rely 
solely upon a diversion charge controller to control a charge. If 
that diversion load were to break, then we would have nothing 
to prevent a perhaps dangerous overcharging of the battery.
• 706.33(B)(2) Circuits with Diversion Charge Controller and 
Diversion Load—We need to have:
• Current of diversion load ≤ current rating of diversion 
load charge controller
• Voltage rating of the diversion load > maximum ESS 
voltage
• Power of diversion load must be ≥ 150% power of char￾ging source
• Ampacity diversion load circuit ≥ 150% max current 
diversion charge controller
• OCPD diversion load circuit ≥ 150% max current diver￾sion charge controller
If the diversion load is the utility, then we do not need to follow 
706.33(B)(2) according to 706.33(B)(3) ESS Using Interactive 
Inverters (too bad, I was hoping to use this to control the big bad 
utility company).
706 Part V Flow Batteries ESS
Flow batteries use pumps to move electrolyte and we do not see a 
lot of them, except in articles that claim there is a new technology 
that is going to take over, which rarely happens.250 Storage Articles
706.40 General (Flow Batteries)—Flow battery components 
must also follow parts I General, II Disconnecting Means and 
III Installation Requirements of Article 706. In the 2020 NEC 
we were, and no longer are directed to Article 692 Fuel Cell 
Systems. A flow battery is like a fuel cell in many ways.
706.41 Electrolyte Classification—Electrolyte shall be identified.
706.42 Electrolyte Containment—Electrolyte shall have contain￾ment to prevent spills.
706.43 Flow Controls—Controls to shut down provided in case of 
electrolyte blockage.
706.44 Pumps and Other Handling Equipment—Pumps rated for 
electrolyte.
706 Part VI Other Energy Storage Technologies
Part VI says to follow the Code and Parts I through IV of 706. 
Some other types of energy storage technologies that could fit 
here include flywheels, compressed air, capacitors, gravity storage, 
and whatever else some genius invents. Then 706 finishes with 
flywheels next.
706.51 Flywheel ESS (FESS)
FESS shall comply with the following.
(1) FESS not in 1- or 2-family dwellings (that takes all the fun out 
of it!).
(2) FESS shall have bearing monitoring and controls.
(3) FESS shall have means to contain moving parts upon failure. 
This sounds like fun! An out-of-control flywheel can be like a 
bomb and cause serious injury. Most flywheels are buried.
(4) Spin down time shall be in maintenance documentation.
Article 710 Stand-Alone Systems
In the 2014 NEC, this material was covered in 690.10. Since then, 
the NEC has separated stand-alone systems from PV systems 
since there could be various power sources for a stand-alone 
system.Storage Articles 251
710.1 Scope
This article covers electric power production systems that 
operate in island mode not connected to an electric utility or 
other electric power production and distribution network.
Informational Note: These systems operate independently 
from an electric utility and include isolated microgrid systems. 
Stand-alone systems often include a single or a compatible 
interconnection of sources such as engine generators, solar PV, 
wind, ESS, or batteries.
This brief article covers electric power production sources that 
operate in island mode and not connected to a power production 
and distribution network.
Discussion: The 2023 NEC seeks to provide a better differen￾tiation between stand-alone systems and other types of systems. 
Previously, a grid-tied battery backup system could be considered 
a stand-alone system when operating in island mode. This is no 
longer the case. With the changes to the Article 710 scope, and 
the new Part III of Article 705, Interconnected Systems Operating 
in Island Mode (see page 234), it is clear that Article 710 systems 
NEVER connect to a utility system. A remote stand-alone system 
that becomes interconnected with the utility grid moves from an 
Article 710 system to a Part III, Article 705 system.
Stand-alone mode was officially changed to island mode in the 
2020 NEC at the insistence of the islanders in Hawaii. They deserve 
it, given how often the power goes out there.
Multimode inverters can operate in island mode or interactive 
mode, but if a multimode were never connected to the grid, then it 
would only operate in island mode.
710.6 Equipment Approval
Equipment must be listed, or field labeled. Just because your ESS 
is off grid, does not mean you do not have to follow the rules. Don’t 
use a non-UL listed truck stop 5kW 12V inverter for your homestead 
unless it is fireproof. This has been known to happen. That would be 
417 Amps!252 Storage Articles
710.10 Identification of Power Sources
A plaque, label, or directory will be at the power source’s 
disconnecting means, or at an approved readily visible location. 
This will show each power source’s disconnecting means location.
710.12 Stand-Alone Inverter Input Circuit Current
We mentioned (page 248) when we were discussing 706.30(A)
(3) Inverter Input Circuit Current that we would go into more 
detail here.
Maximum current shall be the continuous inverter input current 
when inverter is producing rated power at lowest input voltage.
Discussion: A stand-alone inverter takes power from a battery 
and the battery will go through a range of voltages, depending 
on whether the battery is fully charged, charging fast or slow, if 
the load is surging and the minimum allowable voltage, before the 
inverter will no longer take power from the battery in order to pro￾tect the battery from too deep of a discharge.
Since power = voltage × current, for consistent power, as the 
battery voltage becomes lower, then the current will have to be higher 
in order to have consistent rated output power.
For example, with a 1000W inverter, if the voltage is 14V as the 
battery is charging and we ignore inverter losses, then the required 
current would be calculated as:
1000W/14V = 71A
As the battery voltage goes down to 11.5A, then the calculation 
would be:
1000W/11.5V = 87A
If we had a 90% efficient inverter (hope it is better than 90%), 
then we could also calculate for the extra input current required to 
compensate for inverter losses to be a factor of 0.9.
87A/0.9 = 97AStorage Articles 253
Stand-alone inverters require more input current at lower voltages 
to make the same amount of power.
In the inverter installation manual, it may say that at a lower 
battery voltage, power (and thus current) will be reduced, so be 
sure to read the instructions. NEC 110.3(B) says we have to follow 
instructions, since that is how the equipment was tested and listed. 
Instructions, however, do not supersede the NEC; we have to 
follow both.
Stand-alone inverters often have values for continuous 
current, which match the power rating of the inverter, 
but also have current values for surges of current that are 
greater than the continuous current rating of the inverter. 
For instance, it is not unusual for a 2kW stand-alone 
inverter to be able to handle a surge of 4kW for several 
seconds. This is because loads often require surge currents 
to get started. We size the wires based on the continuous 
currents and the stand-alone inverter output circuit max￾imum current, the wires and equipment are sized by the 
continuous current, which is less than the surge currents. 
We do not size the wires based on the stand-alone inverter’s 
greater surge currents.
Note that, in Figure 10.1 on the next page, there are power 
ratings that require much more current for time frames that 
are less than three hours (continuous). Wire sizes are based 
on currents that are continuous. 16.7A is based on 2000W 
at 120V. For short periods of time, there will be surges of 
double the current. Since the time is short, the wire will not 
have time to heat up and cause a problem.
Since we are on the subject, an inverter operating at full power 
will essentially have no surge capability, because even short surges 
will typically trip the inverter. To get the full surge capability, it 
is best to operate at half power. Using our example of a 2000W 
inverter, if we run it at 1000 watts, it will be ready to give us 4000 
watts for short periods of time whenever we need it.254 Storage Articles
710.15 General
710.15 is the heart of Article 710 and Article 690 refers us to 710.15
710.15(A) Supply Output
Power supply can have less capacity than the calculated load.
Power supply shall be at least as much as the largest load. This 
is a bit of a duh statement, but it needs to be stated. Don’t connect 
a 10kW load to a 5kW inverter. It will not work out for you. It’s 
not unsafe unless you consider stupidity a hazard. Never forget 
that everyone is entitled to one fatal mistake. What will happen is 
the inverter will not be able to supply the load and will turn off. 
You may have to turn off the big load and push a reset button to 
get it working again.
Power supply can include multiple power supplies, such as solar, 
generator, and energy storage.
Figure 10.1 Partial datasheet from outback stand-alone inverter.
Source: Courtesy Outback Power.Storage Articles 255
Oftentimes off-grid system owners will turn on a generator when 
using high power loads.
710.15(B) Sizing and Protection
Conductors between stand-alone source and disconnecting means 
shall be sized based on the sum of the output ratings of the stand￾alone sources. Additionally, and obviously, 3-phase sources must 
be balanced to be compatible with loads.
When you are connected to a utility, your service conductors do 
not have to be sized based on the available current from the utility, 
but for a stand-alone source you have to size your conductors 
based on the source(s).
710.15(C) Single 120V Supply
Often a 120V inverter is used in stand-alone systems, and 120/
240V designed service equipment may be used (bonding L1 to L2).
• The neutral bus must be rated greater than the sum of the loads.
• No multi-wire branch circuits since neutral currents will not 
cancel each other out and a sign must read:
WARNING:
SINGLE 120-VOLT SUPPLY. DO NOT CONNECT 
MULTIWIRE BRANCH CIRCUITS!
710.15(D) Three-Phase Supply
Three-phase is allowed.
710.15(E) Energy Storage or Backup Power Requirements
“Energy storage or backup power supplies not required.”
Direct PV systems are stand-alone systems, which only work 
when the sun is shining.
710.15(F) Voltage and Frequency Control
Voltage and frequency shall be within limits compatible with loads.256 Storage Articles
Perhaps we can use a 230V 50Hz European inverter if we use 
compatible loads. This way we can have smaller conductors for the 
same amount of power. It is not all that practical as all receptacles 
would have to be special to prevent people from plugging 120V loads 
into 230V outlets. Perhaps your inner Francophile will love it though.
Article 480 Stationary Standby Batteries
480.1 Scope
This article applies to all installations of stationary standby 
batteries having a capacity greater than 3.6 MJ (1 kWh). Remember 
that ESS are not stationary standby batteries whether you want 
them to be or not.
Definition: Battery, Stationary Standby. (Stationary Standby 
Battery)
A battery that spends the majority of the time on continuous 
float charge or in a high state of charge, in readiness for a dis￾charge event. (CMP-13)
Nominal Voltage (Battery or Cell)
Value assigned for convenient designation (nominal is in 
name only).
Informational Note: Nominal voltages for different chemistries 
are listed as:
Lead-acid 2V/cell
Alkali 1.2V/cell
Lithium-ion 3.2 to 3.8V/cell
It is a race between lead-acid and lithium that lead-acid has been 
winning since as early as 250 BC according to some sources. It looks 
as if that is changing with lithium battery technology going down 
in price and up in quality. As you can see, there is a range for the 
lithium-ion battery nominal voltage, which has to do with the cathode 
materials. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells have a 3.2V 
nominal voltage, whereas lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide 
(NMC) and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) cells 
have a 3.7V nominal voltage.Storage Articles 257
480.3 Equipment
Storage batteries and battery management equipment shall be 
listed, except for lead-acid batteries.
Interesting how we do not have to list lead-acid batteries.
480.6 Overcurrent Protection for Prime Movers
OCPD not required for 60V or less if battery provides power for 
starting, ignition, or control of prime movers.
Discussion: A prime moveris the machine that turns the generator. 
An example of a prime mover is an internal combustion engine that 
spins something to make electricity. So, your starting battery cir￾cuit for your generator does not need overcurrent protection if under 
60V. Other examples of prime movers are waterwheels, windmills, 
and steam turbines.
480.7 Disconnect Methods
480.7(A) Disconnecting Means
Disconnecting means required for stationary standby battery 
ungrounded conductors with voltage over 60V.
Apparently, battery systems below 60V are not required to have 
disconnects. This goes along with the overcurrent exception in 480.6. 
Energy storage systems however are required to have disconnecting 
means according to706.15(A) ESS Disconnecting Means, so it 
would be a good idea to be able to turn things off.
480.7(B) Emergency Disconnect
1- and 2-family dwellings with a stationary standby battery system 
shall have a disconnect or remote-controlled disconnect outside 
of the building at a readily accessible location that is labeled 
“EMERGENCY DISCONNECT.” This requirement is only rele￾vant if an AHJ were to allow a stationary standby battery in a 
1- and 2-family dwelling. These types of batteries would likely only 
be allowed in the attached garage of a dwelling. If the standby 
battery is located in a non-dwelling power shed for instance, no 
external disconnect is required because it is not a dwelling.258 Storage Articles
480.7(C) Disconnection of Series Battery Circuits
Battery circuits shall have disconnect provisions to break parts 
of the circuit into 240V dc segments or less. Non-load-break and 
bolted disconnects are acceptable.
480.7(D) Remote Actuation
If disconnecting means can operate with remote controls and 
controls are not within sight of the battery, then the disconnecting 
means shall be able to be locked on the open position. Location of 
controls to be marked on disconnecting means.
480.7(E) Busway
Disconnecting means can be incorporated into the busway.
480.7(F) Notification
Marking shall include:
(1) Nominal battery voltage (all that is required on 1- and 2-family 
dwellings)
(2) Available fault current (available from manufacturer)
(3) Arc-flash label
(4) Date short-circuit current calculation performed
Points (2), (3), and (4) are not required on 1- and 2-family 
dwellings. Only nominal battery voltage is required on 1- and 2-
family dwellings.
480.7(G) Identification of Power Sources
This follows what we have already covered in different articles 
regarding plaques and directories. We are directed to 705.10 (pages 
160, 169 and 194) and 710.10 (pages 169 and 252). There is an excep￾tion for cases where a 480.7(A) disconnect is not required (page 257).
480.9 Battery Support Systems
If using a corrosive electrolyte (like lead-acid), then support struc￾ture shall be resistant to corrosion. Metal structures shall have Storage Articles 259
nonconducting support members or be constructed with insu￾lating material. Paint alone is not sufficient.
480.10 Battery Locations
480.10(A) Ventilation
Ventilation appropriate to battery technology.
Lead-acid and nickel-cadmium batteries can create explosive 
hydrogen gasses.
Lithium batteries do not require ventilation as some inspectors 
once required since 480 used to call for it. Lithium batteries do 
not release hydrogen when overcharged, like lead-acid batteries do. 
Electrolysis is a way of making hydrogen with electricity. Water 
molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen. If you stick a positive 
and a negative electrode into water, hydrogen will come off of the 
negative and oxygen will come off of the positive.
480.10(B) Live Parts
Live parts shall be guarded in accordance with Section 110.27 
Guarding of Live Parts.
480.10(C) Spaces About Stationary Standby Batteries
Spaces around batteries shall comply with Section 110.26 Spaces 
About Electrical Equipment and 110.34 Work Space and Guarding.
For battery racks, there shall be a 1-inch space between a cell 
container and any wall or structure on a side not requiring access 
for maintenance.
This 1-inch space was on a national certification exam, so it must 
be important.
480.11(A) Vented Cells
Vented cells shall have flame arrestors (typical lead-acid).
480.11(B) Sealed Cells
Sealed cells shall have pressure release vents.260 Storage Articles
480.12 Battery Interconnections
Flexible cables shall be permitted and if used shall be used with 
proper lugs, terminals, etc. (rated for flexible cables) and cables 
shall be listed for the environmental conditions.
It has been a pet peeve for people writing exam questions to make 
sure that proper terminals are used for flexible fine stranded cables. 
This probably means a compression lug. If 480.12 did not exist, we 
would still have to do this, since it is obvious and included in other 
parts of the NEC. You do not have to use flexible fine stranded cable 
for batteries, but it can make maintenance easier, and it can help 
reduce mechanical stress on battery terminals.
480.13 Ground-Fault Detection
Battery circuits over 100V between conductors or to ground shall 
be permitted to work with ungrounded conductors if there is 
ground-fault detection and interruption.
This means that we are not required to have a grounded conductor.
Article 625 Electric Vehicle Power Transfer System is an art￾icle that will be used more and more by installers of PV and ESS 
equipment. Section 625.42 provided the basis for establishing 
705.13 Power Control Systems in the 2020 NEC. In the 2023 NEC 
625.42 was renamed Energy Management System (EMS) to match 
the changes to 705.13 (page 222) and 750.30 (page 223). Here is the 
language of 625.42 for reference:
625.42(A) Energy Management System (EMS)
Where an EMS in accordance with 750.30 provides load man￾agement of EVSE, the maximum equipment load on a service 
and feeder shall be the maximum load permitted by the EMS. 
The EMS shall be permitted to be integral to one piece of 
equipment or integral to a listed system consisting of more than 
one piece of equipment. When one or more pieces of equipment 
are provided with an integral load management control, the 
system shall be marked to indicate this control is provided.
This language is critical to many residential systems that include 
PV and ESS since it allows the EMS to control the EV charger to 
keep the maximum load on a service or feeder within the ratings of Storage Articles 261
the service or feeder. Without this language, it would not be clear 
that a 40-amp EV charger could ever be installed on a 100-amp resi￾dential service. Few 100-amp services have the available capacity to 
add a level 2 EV charger without an EMS. However, with an EMS to 
control the EV charger, the charger can be used if the EMS prevents 
overload of the 100-amp service. This means that if the load on the 
house is above 70-amps, the EV charge will either turn off or reduce 
power to the available capacity of the 100-amp service. This is a very 
big deal when adding EV chargers on 100-amp services.
Article 625 also contains section 625.48 Interactive Equipment, 
which will direct electric vehicles that can backfeed the grid to 
Article 705. Section 625.48 also indicates that these bidirectional 
batteries on wheels need to be listed for exporting power.
When you are connecting your electric vehicle to your house 
as an optional standby system, you are encouraged to follow the 
Code and use Article 702 Optional Standby Systems. Article 702 is 
most often used when backing up a building or a house with a gen￾erator. There are some YouTube videos that show people how to 
connect electric cars to their houses to operate in stand-by mode in 
a non-Code-compliant way. Be careful! Do not have too much fun! 
Article 702 has historically been about connecting a backup power 
source through a transfer switch. The 2023 NEC changed all that. 
Now Article 702 is supposed to be used for transfer switches and 
microgrid interconnect devices (MIDs). Most PV systems used for 
backup power connect to a multimode inverter or work with an 
MID. The requirements for automatic load connections in 702.4(B)
(2) require that we use an energy management system (EMS) to 
control the loads connected to the microgrid. Fortunately, many 
microgrid systems are being listed as PCS or EMS which make them 
compliant with 702.4.
As you and your customers contemplate implementing energy 
storage into a grid-connected PV project, be sure to understand 
the regulations and incentives for connecting energy storage to the 
grid. Policies are evolving, and the Public Utilities Commissions 
are working hard to determine how energy storage will be brought 
into the grid. A good source for finding out about incentives 
for all things renewable is the Database of State Incentives for 
Renewables and Efficiency at www.dsireusa.org, which is from 
North Carolina, just like Bill. In fact, he helped start the organiza￾tion that developed and maintains this database.DOI: 10.4324/9781003189862-12
11 Chapters 1–4, Chapter 9 Tables, 
and Informative Annex C
So far, we have covered the NEC articles that are used often in the 
solar industry, including 690, 705, 480, 706, 710, and 625. These 
articles often refer to other articles in the NEC and this chapter will 
go over the different articles of the NEC from a PV perspective.
First, we will cover Chapters 1–4 of the NEC, which apply gen￾erally to all electrical installations. We will then mention the rele￾vance of, and when to use, the articles in Chapters 5–7. Finally, we 
will cover Chapter 9 and look at the informative annexes that we 
can use when designing PV systems.
Chapters 1–4 have been referenced throughout this book, espe￾cially with respect to Articles 690 and 705.
Here are some of the top articles to be familiar with in 
Chapters 1–4:
• Article 100 Definitions (huge in 2023 NEC)
• Article 240 Overcurrent Protection
• Article 250 Grounding and Bonding
• Article 310 Conductors for General Wiring [especially the 310 
tables!]
• Article 358 Electrical Metallic Tubing: Type EMT
Chapters 1–4 of the NEC
The NEC is divided into chapters, and the number of the chapter 
precedes the three-digit number of the article. For instance, 
Chapter 6 Special Occupancies includes Article 690 Solar PV 
Photovoltaic Systems and Chapter 1 General begins with Article Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C 263
100 Definitions. Chapters 1–4 apply to all electrical installations, 
including PV systems.
An outline of often-used-for-PV articles, parts, and sections in 
Chapters 1–4 of the NEC follows. Italics are author comments.
Recall the hierarchy of NEC organization: Chapters/Articles/
Parts/Sections.
Chapter 1 General
Article 100 Definitions
Article 100 is now the longest article in the NEC, since in the 
2023 NEC all of the “.2” definitions were moved to Article 100, 
such as 690.2, 705.2, 706.2 etc. Rather than cutting and pasting 
all the definitions in Article 100 and making this book twice as 
heavy, we recommend going straight to the source. The definitions 
hopefully are self-explanatory and if not, we will cover some of 
the confusing definitions here, to make them readily accessible to 
your brain.
Article 100 is a great resource for defining terms throughout the 
NEC, including “PV.”
First off, in Article 100 definitions, we see three types of access￾ible, one being applied to equipment, another applied to wiring 
methods, and the third is the well-used term readily accessible. Let’s 
start off our definitions with the three “accessibles,” just as Article 
100 starts off with these “accessibles.”
Accessible (as Applied to Equipment)
“Capable of being reached for operation, renewal or inspection.”
Remember that accessible equipment can be reached.
Accessible (as Applied to Wiring Methods)
“Capable of being removed or exposed without damaging the 
building structure or finish or not permanently closed in or blocked 
by the structure, or other electrical equipment, other building 
systems, or finish of the building.”
Remember that if it is a wiring method and you have to dismantle 
something, then it is not an accessible wiring method.264 Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C
Accessible, Readily
“Capable of being reached quickly for operation, renewal, or 
inspections without requiring those to whom ready access is 
requisite to take action such as to use tools (other than keys), to 
climb over or under, to remove obstacles, or to resort to portable 
ladders, and so forth.”
Remember that readily accessible means you can get at some￾thing with a key or less and do not need tools or a ladder to get at 
something.
Branch Circuit, Multiwire (Multiwire Branch Circuit)
A branch circuit that consists of two or more ungrounded 
conductors that have a voltage between them, and a neutral 
conductor that has equal voltage between it and each ungrounded 
conductor of the circuit and that is connected to the neutral 
conductor of the system.
This is referenced in Article 710 Stand-Alone Systems: When 
you have a 120V system and are using typical 240V split-phase 
equipment, you are not allowed to use multiwire branch circuits, since 
you may overload the neutral.
Converter, Dc-to-Dc (Dc-to-Dc Converter)
A device that can provide an output dc voltage and current at a 
higher or lower value than the input dc voltage and current.
Discussion: The dc-to-dc converter (“optimizer is a SolarEdge 
term”) definition was put into the Code in 2014.
Power Optimizers
Dc-to-dc converters are commonly referred to in the industry 
as “power optimizers,” which is really a marketing term from 
SolarEdge. If a dc-to-dc converter did not work as well as 
advertised or was clipping power (reducing power on pur￾pose), perhaps we would call it a “power-pessimizer.”
We could also have dc-to-dc converters that are not 
associated with PV and were part of an energy storage system. Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C 265
In a way a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) charge 
controller is a dc-to-dc converter taking one voltage in and 
another voltage out. Also, within our string inverters elec￾tronically, there is usually one or more dc-to-dc converters 
and we could call each separate MPPT in the inverter a dc-to￾dc converter. A transformer converts ac voltage and current 
to a different level of ac voltage and current, like a dc-to-dc 
converter converts dc voltage and current to a different level. 
Perhaps in the future we can call a transformer an ac-to-ac 
converter and an inverter a dc-to-ac converter.
Electronic Power Converter
A device that uses power electronics to convert one form of elec￾trical power into another form of electrical power.
Discussion: An inverter or a dc-to-dc converter is an EPC; however, 
a transformer is not, since it uses magnetics instead of electronics.
Energy Management System (EMS)
A system consisting of any of the following: a monitor(s), 
communications equipment, a controller(s), a timer(s), or other 
device(s) that monitors and/or controls an electrical load or a 
power production or storage source.
Discussion: This is a new definition and as we discussed on page 
222 the 2023 NEC has changed 705.13 Power Control Systems to 
705.13 Energy Management Systems (EMS). EMS was already 
Article 750 in the NEC; however, now, as you can see from this new 
definition, an EMS can control sources, in addition to loads.
Energy Storage System (ESS)
One or more devices installed as a system capable of storing energy 
and providing electrical energy into the premises wiring system or 
an electric power production and distribution network.
Discussion: In an Informational Note, it explains that the ESS 
differs from a stationary standby battery installation, since the later 
spends most of its time in float charge or a high charge in readiness 266 Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C
for a discharge event. This Informational Note is an interesting 
distinction; however, many ESS are used as a standby source and 
not cycled unless there is an outage. The Tesla Powerwall at my 
mom’s house is never cycled down unless the grid goes down and 
I would still call it an ESS, so perhaps this Informational Note is 
not entirely accurate.
Generating Capacity, Inverter
This is the output of the inverter. This is measured in kW, W, kVA 
or VA and at 40°C. We often call this our ac system size. 690.7 
Maximum Voltage and 690.8 Circuit Sizing and Current have some 
special exceptions for systems with a generating capacity over 
100kW and Article 691 Large-Scale Photovoltaic (PV) Electric 
Supply Stations has exceptions that apply to systems with a gener￾ating capacity of 5000kW (5MW) or greater, among other criteria.
Inverter, Interactive (Interactive Inverter)
Discussion: On the street they call this a grid-tied inverter. 
Interactive inverters operate in what can be called current-control
mode (a.k.a. grid-following mode). A stand-alone inverter operates 
in voltage-control mode (a.k.a. grid-forming mode).
Inverter, Multimode
A multimode inverter can work in interactive mode (current-control
mode), or it can work in island mode (voltage-control mode). 
A multimode inverter will typically have different outputs for the 
interactive and island-mode circuits. A multimode inverter has also 
been called a bimodal inverter in some books since there are nor￾mally two primary modes (current mode and voltage mode). Very 
often multimode inverters are incorrectly (to the NEC) called hybrid 
inverters. Inverters may not be hybrid. A NEC-defined hybrid PV 
system will have another source of power besides PV or batteries, 
such as a generator.
Island Mode
The operating mode for power production equipment or microgrids 
that allows energy to be supplied to loads that are disconnected Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C 267
from an electric power production and distribution network or 
other primary power source. (CMP-4)
Microgrid
An electric power system capable of operating in island mode and 
capable of being interconnected to an electric power production 
and distribution network or other primary source while operating in 
interactive mode, which includes the ability to disconnect from and 
reconnect to a primary source and operate in island mode. (CMP-4)
Discussion: This definition has always seemed as if you could 
not have a microgrid, without a grid to connect and disconnect 
from; however, the first Informational Note in the scope of Article 
710 shows that isolated microgrids are stand-alone systems.
“Informational Note: These systems operate independently 
from an electric utility and include isolated microgrid systems. 
Stand-alone systems often include a single or a compatible inter￾connection of sources such as engine generators, solar PV, wind, 
ESS, or batteries.”
Microgrid Interconnect Device (MID)
A device that enables a microgrid system to separate from and 
reconnect to an interconnected primary power source.
Power Production Equipment
Electrical generating equipment supplied by any source other than 
utility service, up to the source disconnecting means.
PV (Photovoltaic) System (PV System) (Photovoltaic System)
“The total components, circuits, and equipment up to and 
including the PV system disconnecting means that, in combin￾ation, convert solar energy into electric energy.”
The PV system used to include the energy storage system and 
even some loads in the 2014 NEC and earlier. Since renewable 
energy is taking over, we get to have more specialized code and sep￾arate articles for these different systems. We can often say that the 
separation point between the PV system and something else is the 
disconnecting means closest to the point of interconnection for an 268 Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C
interactive system. For a dc coupled stand-alone system, this discon￾nect would be the dc disconnect going to the energy storage system. 
A PV system does not include storage or loads.
Service
“The conductors and equipment connecting the serving utility to 
the wiring system of the premises served.” Electricity is served!
Service Conductors
“The conductors from the service point to the service disconnecting 
means.”
On your house this would be between the meter (service point) 
and the main breaker. We typically make the source connection to a 
service (supply-side connection) on the service conductors.
Service Drop and Service Lateral
“The conductors between the utility supply system and the service 
point.”
A service drop is overhead, and a service lateral is underground. 
Often coming from a transformer to your meter.
Service Equipment
Main disconnect and associated equipment.
Stand-Alone System
Synonym: Off-grid.
NEC wording: “A system that is not connected to an electric 
power production and distribution network.”
Note: Article 710 is Stand-Alone Systems.
Article 110 Requirements for General Installations
Article 110 is mostly used for electrical connection rules, working 
spaces around equipment, and enclosure types.
110.14(C)(1) covers the terminal temperature ratings as they 
relate to equipment ratings and conductor ratings. It tells us that 
we can only operate a conductor up to its current ampacity (at Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C 269
30°C) for the temperature of the terminal to which it is connected. 
Therefore, a 10 AWG THWN-2 conductor can be operated at no 
greater than 35A if the wire is connected to a 75°C terminal on a cir￾cuit breaker. (Stay tuned for wire sizing examples in next chapter.)
110.21(B) Field-Applied Hazard Markings
Often referred to in 690 and 705. Labels meeting these 
requirements shall:
(1) Warn of hazard using effective words, colors or symbols
(2) Be permanently attached and not handwritten unless hand￾written information is subject to change
There are ANSI (American National Standards Institute) 
standards recommended in Informational Notes that go into colors, 
font sizes, wording, design, and durability.
110.26 Spaces about Electrical Equipment
This is often 3 feet back and 30 inches wide or the width of the 
equipment for wider equipment. Also 6.5 feet high or height of 
equipment, whichever is greater. Table 110.26(A) has different 
spaces for higher voltage equipment and if there are exposed live 
parts, the distances can be greater. Recall that exposed live parts 
means: “Capable of being inadvertently touched nearer than a safe 
distance by a person.”
Table 110.28 Enclosure Types
This includes NEMA enclosure types for wet areas, wind, dust, 
etc. Remember that any NEMA with a 3 or 4 in it is most com￾monly used outdoors, along with other NEMA ratings.
Chapter 2 Wiring and Protection
Article 200 Use and Identification of Grounded Conductors
200.6 Means of Identifying Grounded Conductors
200.6 is where we are told to have a usually white or sometimes 
gray (or other) grounded conductor. [See 690.41(A)(5) page 134]. 270 Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C
A grounded conductor is a conductor that can carry current but is 
“solidly” connected to ground and operates at the same voltage as 
ground. Applying 200.6 on a dc PV circuit is way less common for 
2023 NEC (2017 NEC and after) compliant PV systems than for 
2014 NEC and earlier compliant PV systems since the function￾ally grounded array definition requires no dc grounded conductor 
marking. See page 128. We still do have white (or gray) colored 
grounded conductors on the ac side when inverters require a neu￾tral, just not on the dc side.
Article 230 Services
Source connections to a service (supply-side connections) need 
to be properly bonded using best practices like service equipment 
since they are exposed to utility currents. In the 2023 NEC, these 
provisions are found (hidden) in 250.25 Grounding of Systems 
Permitted to be Connected on the Supply Side of the Service 
Disconnect. We have referred to and explained some of the infor￾mation in Article 230 when covering 705.11 (page 197). Services 
typically have no OCPD coming from the utility and have enough 
short-circuit current to vaporize metal in some cases. Vaporizing 
metal is not recommended. (It is the worst kind of vaping.)
In earlier versions of the NEC, there was confusion about 
methods of bonding the neutral of a supply-side connection. In 
the 2023 NEC, it is stated that we are to use Parts II through V and 
VIII of Article 250. Solar is not a service, but a source connection 
to a service is treated like a service when it comes to the point of 
system grounding.
Article 240 Overcurrent Protection
240.4 Protection of Conductors
240.4(B) OVERCURRENT DEVICES RATED 800 AMPERES OR LESS
You can protect a conductor with an OCPD that is the next higher 
standard overcurrent device size above the conductor ampacity. This 
is the part of the following chapter on wire sizing that can be con￾fusing because it allows a conductor to have an ampacity less than 
the OCPD rating that is protecting it. Sometimes installers think 
that the OCPD has to be less than the short-circuit current or Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C 271
125% of continuous current, which is not the case, since we do not 
want false trips. 240.4(C) tells us that, once your OCPD is 800A or 
more, the ampacity of the conductor must be no smaller than the 
OCPD rating. You can never have too much ampacity, unless you 
are trying to save money or space.
240.4(D) SMALL CONDUCTORS
“Small conductor rule”:
• 14 AWG copper wire needs at least 15A overcurrent protection.
• 12 AWG copper wire needs at least 20A overcurrent protection.
• 10 AWG copper wire needs at least 30A overcurrent protection.
There is more information in 240.4(D) about small aluminum 
conductors in the NEC.
Many indoor electricians go by the small conductor rule for 
wire sizing, since they do not have high ambient temperatures and 
are just running NMC (Romex) to breakers all day long. Many 
solar electricians use larger conductors because of voltage drop 
(efficiency).
240.6 Standard Ampere Ratings
• Special fuses
• 1A, 3A, 6A, and 601A (not used for us much)
• Fuses and breakers standard sizes from Table 240.6(A)
• 5A increments 10 to 50A
• 10A increments 50 to 110A
• 25A increments 125 to 250A
• 50A increments 250 to 500A
[See Table 240.6(A) for larger OCPD sizes up to 6000A.]
We are allowed to use a larger OCPD than calculated if the 
installation instructions of the equipment, such as the inverter, say 
that we can (if it was tested that way). For instance, since 25A 
breakers are difficult to find, we can often use a 30A breaker as 
long as the wire sizing checks work, as we will see in the next 
chapter. There are now larger 100A–300A inverters that can use 
a 1000A fuse in its listing and instructions, which allows multiple 272 Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C
inverters on a single set of fuses (much like we already do for 
microinverters).
240.21(B) FEEDER TAPS
We covered this when we covered 705.12(B)(2), pages 161, 214 and 
221.
• 240.21(B)(1) 10-foot tap rule (we used the 10-foot tap rule for 
interactive inverters in the 2014 to 2020 NEC, but not in the 
2023 NEC, where we now use the 1/3rd calculation from the 
25-foot tap rule below). The 10-foot tap rule was not often a 
factor anyway.
• 240.21(B)(2) 25-foot tap rule (for conductors 25 feet or less, we 
can use 1/3rd of the ampacity in our calculations [see 705.12(A)
(2) on page 208].
• 240.21(B)(4) Taps in high bay manufacturing buildings use the 
1/3rd calculation and can go up to 25 feet horizontally and 100 
feet in total length.
Article 250 Grounding and Bonding
690 Part V is also Grounding and Bonding; see page 126. 690 Part 
V often refers to 250.
250 Part III Grounding Electrode System and 
Grounding Electrode Conductor
This is where experts differ and there is confusion. You could say 
that with different conditions, such as lightning and the variable 
resistance of earth, there is no perfect solution to grounding, which 
is why there may be so many different opinions. Lightning protection 
is not covered in the NEC and is covered in NFPA 780: Standard for 
the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems, which is not some￾thing that AHJs typically adopt. Different AHJs will have different 
ways of doing things, especially when it comes to grounding.
250.52(A) Grounding Electrodes Permitted
(1) metal underground water pipe (common)Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C 273
(2) metal in-ground support structure
(3) concrete-encased electrode (common)
(4) ground ring
(5) rod and pipe electrodes (common)
(6) other listed electrodes
(7) plate electrodes (common in Canada)

where to go.
Table 250.66 Size of AC Grounding Electrode Conductors (GEC)
The size of the ac grounding electrode conductor (GEC) is based 
on the size of the largest ungrounded service entrance conductor.
Usually, when dealing with PV on an existing service, you 
already have an existing ac grounding electrode conductor and do 
not need to go to Table 250.66.
Part VI Equipment Grounding and Equipment Grounding Conductors
250.122 Size of Equipment Grounding Conductors (EGC)
EGC sizes are based on the size of the overcurrent protection 
device. See page 146. This table address of 250.122 may be worth 
memorizing for some since it is commonly used for ac and dc. It 
is interesting to some that the EGC can be much smaller than 
the current-carrying conductor for PV systems, and also for PV 
systems we are not required to upsize the EGC when we upsize the 
EGC for voltage drop reasons, as we discussed on page 145 where 
we covered 690.45 Size of Equipment Grounding Conductors.274 Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C
250.166 Size of the Direct-Current Grounding 
Electrode Conductor (GEC)
For most PV systems, including functional grounded systems, 
there are no dc grounding electrode conductor requirements. 
In these systems, the ac equipment grounding conductor and ac 
grounding electrode conductor provide reference and a pathway to 
the grounding electrode system.
690.47(A)(1) “For PV systems that are not solidly grounded, the 
equipment grounding conductor for the output of the PV system, 
where connected to associated distribution equipment connected 
to a grounding electrode system, shall be permitted to be the only 
connection to ground for the system.”
In past Code cycles, for you old-timers, it was common for an 
AHJ to require a separate dc electrode or dc grounding electrode 
conductor for most PV systems. It is now silicon crystal clear that 
this is no longer the case.
An example of a “solidly grounded” PV system that requires a 
dc grounding electrode conductor is a typical dc direct PV water 
pumping system.
Chapter 3 Wiring Methods and Materials
Article 300 General Requirements for Wiring Methods and Materials
300.7 Raceways Exposed to Different Temperatures
300.7(A) SEALING
If a raceway is going to areas of different temperature changes, 
seal the raceway at the junction of the temperature change to pre￾vent condensation where warm air would otherwise meet cold pipe. 
In the 2020 NEC it was added, and kept in the 2023 NEC, that the 
sealant shall be identified for use with cable insulation, conductor 
insulation, a bare conductor, or other components. Some molecules 
do not play well with others. Duct seal is often used.
300.7(B) EXPANSION
If a raceway is long enough and exposed to enough changes in 
temperature, calculations like voltage temperature calculations can Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C 275
be made to determine the need for expansion joints or flexible con￾duit. These calculations also apply to the expansion of solar rails.
We can take the difference between the low and high tempera￾ture and then multiply the difference in temperature by a coeffi￾cient to get the expansion.
A PV fire was once blamed by some on expansion joints scraping 
the insulation off a wire on a PV output circuit. Some electricians 
will use some flexible conduit between stretches of rigid conduit to 
allow for expansion, rather than expansion joints.
Article 310 Conductors for General Wiring
This is where we do a lot of our wire sizing, which we will do in the 
next chapter. 310 is a very popular place in the NEC.
310.14(A)(2) Selection of Ampacity (plus exception)
If different sections of a circuit have different ampacities, then the 
lowest ampacity shall apply unless the shorter section is less than 
or equal to 10 feet or 10% of the circuit length, whichever is less.
A conductor can be like a heat sink and the shorter piece can 
share its heat with the longer cooler piece. (Just as a conductor can 
share its coolness with a terminal.) 😎
310 Ampacity Tables (includes the famous Tables 310.16 and 310.17)

Used to derate conductor ampacity in hot places, such as outside 
in the summer. (Someone in charge of 310 is making themselves 
feel important by changing table names every cycle.)
It is recommended by the authors to use ASHRAE 2% average

extension of 310.15(B)(1)(1) and shall be used for solar PV system 
wires rated for 105°C and 125°C, just in case you are planning on 
running your PV circuits through a sauna, or want to use a really 
small conductor.

310.15(B)(2) Rooftop (not a table) is in the 2023 NEC and says 
that if our raceways or cables are 3/4 inch or less above rooftop, 
we shall add a 33°C adder. It was 7/8 inch in the 2020 NEC. It is 
recommended to be at least 1 inch above rooftop to avoid the adder 
and to keep debris from building up on the rooftop.

else that is not in free air.

For conductors in free air (like the PV wire under an array).Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C 277
310 TABLES DISCUSSION
You will get to see us using all these tables in the next chapter on 
wire sizing. Tables 310.16 and 310.17 have columns that have tem￾perature ratings of conductors on them. Some of the commonly 
used conductor insulation types are listed, such as THWN-2 and 
USE-2, which are commonly used wires for PV systems and 90°C 
rated. This means that they can have the amount of current going 
through them in the column for the specific wire size without 
having a chance of going over the temperature rating. We are not 
allowed to go over the temperature rating of the insulation of the 
conductor. Once again, it is best to see our examples in the next 
chapter, Chapter 12 Wire Sizing, and then follow them to size your 
own wires and OCPDs using the same pattern, hopefully all in the 
same sitting, until you get the hang of it. Repetition helps here, 
especially when coupled with common sense, which is almost as 
rare as a 105°C or 125°C rated conductor, which you can find an 
ampacity table for in 690.31(A)(3)(1) covered on page 101. Recall 
that 690 is only for PV systems.
In Table 310.16, look at a 10 AWG THWN-2 and you will 
see in the 90°C insulation column that conductor would have an 
ampacity of 40A when at 30°C (the entire table is for 30°C). If it is 
hotter than 30°C or if there are more than three current-carrying 
conductors in a raceway, then we would have to correct the 30°C 
value to the lower value and have a lower conductor ampacity.
Articles 320–362 Various Cables and Conduits
From EMT to NMC (Romex), you will find it here.
Article 330 Metal-Clad Cable: Type MC
MC Cable is a cable assembly sold with conductors inside of an 
armor of interlocking metal tape. MC Cable can be installed in 
a wet location if the conductors under the metallic covering are 
listed for wet.
MC Cable or raceway is cited in Article 690.31(A) Wiring 
Systems for an option for a wiring method for PV source and 
output circuits in readily accessible locations. Also see page 100.
MC Cable or metal raceway is a wiring method for PV dc 
circuits inside of buildings that is cited in 690.31(D) Direct-Current 
Circuits on or in Buildings. Also see page 118.278 Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C
MC Cable is in no way related to MC connectors. MC (Multi￾Contact) connectors are made by the company Stäubli, a Swiss com￾pany that has not quite a monopoly on the PV connector industry 
according to MC Hammer (a rapper born in Oakland, just like Sean).
Article 334 Non-Metallic-Sheathed Cable: Types NM and NMC [Romex]
Also commonly known as Romex, which is a brand name of 
wiring commonly seen in residential buildings. You can have your 
ac inverter circuits in Romex where NM and NMC can be used.
This is a factory-assembled cable with insulated conductors within 
a non-metallic jacket. You will see a lot of this going in and out 
between the studs of a house being built. It is usually yellow or white.
Romex cannot be installed in storage battery rooms.
Article 336 Power and Control Tray Cable: Type TC
Factory-assembled of two or more insulated conductors under a 
non-metallic jacket.
Article 338 Service-Entrance Cable: Types SE and USE
This is where we learn about the USE-2 that we use in our dc 
circuits under the array which also must be listed as RHW-2 at the 
same time, which is normal for most USE-2 wire. We can see more 
about USE-2 uses in PV systems in 690.31(C)(1) Single-Conductor 
Cable (see page 108).
Article 338 says that USE cable cannot be used for interior 
wiring; however, when it is dual listed as RHW-2, then it can be 
used indoors, so it really can be used indoors, since it is almost 
always dual listed as RHW-2. The requirement for USE-2 to be 
dual listed as RHW-2 is new in the 2020 NEC. It is funny how 
this wire that starts with U for underground is sunlight resistant. 
Perhaps it is for those neutrinos that can penetrate a planet.
Article 342 Intermediate Metal Conduit: Type IMC
IMC is a steel threadable raceway which is good at providing phys￾ical protection and for the most part can be used interchangeably 
with RMC (next).Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C 279
In some AHJs, such as many in the Chicago area, EMT is not 
allowed for solar circuits and everyone is using more heavy-duty 
IMC. An AHJ can make up their own rules and not follow the NEC 
whenever they want. AHJs are all powerful, which is one reason why 
the cost of bureaucracy can be $1/watt in some instances according 
to SEIA (www.seia.org/initiatives/solar-automated-permit-process
ing-solarapp). Praise be the AHJ!
Article 344 Rigid Metal Conduit: Type RMC
RMC can be used in the same manner as IMC (above). IMC is 
easier to bend and work with and RMC is thicker.
Article 350 Liquidtight Flexible Metal Conduit: Type LFMC
Liquidtight Flexible Metal Conduit is a metallic raceway, which 
can be used for dc PV circuits inside and outside of buildings. 
Some solar installers will use the more expensive, yet easier to bend 
LFMC rather than EMT. Note that most LFMC is rated 60°C 
when wet. LFMC shall be supported every 4½ feet.
Article 352 Rigid Polyvinyl Chloride Conduit: Type PVC
PVC is most often used in Hawaii outside of buildings due to high 
corrosion rates for metal. PVC cannot be used inside of buildings for 
dc PV circuits, since it is not metal. It is easily broken in cold weather. 
Table 352.30(B) Support of Rigid PVC tells us how often to support 
different sizes of PVC. ¾ inch PVC is supported every 3 feet for example.
Article 356 Liquidtight Flexible Non-Metallic Conduit: Type LFNC
Liquidtight Flexible Non-Metallic Conduit looks a lot like 
Liquidtight Flexible Metallic Conduit from the outside, since the 
metal version, which we just covered in Article 350, has the metal 
inside of plastic.
Many times, you will see solar installers connecting inverters 
to junction boxes, disconnects, monitoring and other equipment 
using LFNC on the outside of a building. You see electricians in 
the field refer to this wiring method as just liquidtight. It is not for 
PV dc circuits inside of a building, since it is not metal. 280 Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C
Article 358 Electrical Metallic Tubing: Type EMT
EMT conduit is the most often used wiring method among solar 
installers on the mainland United States. EMT takes some prac￾tice to be good at bending. Journeyman electricians have EMT 
bending competitions and champions. You can get 10-foot sticks 
of ¾ EMT for just a few bucks (depending on supply-chain issues).
EMT is typically a thin-walled steel raceway that we will fill 
with conductors, such as THWN-2.
EMT can be inside or outside and where exposed to physical 
damage.
EMT is not threaded and we will use watertight connectors 
when outside (wet location).
Although we may be using EMT that is in a wet location with 
watertight connectors, we still need to have a conductor inside the 
EMT that is listed for wet locations. When conduit will go outside 
the conductors inside it will have a good chance of getting wet be 
it from rain or condensation.
358(A) Securely Fastened
The EMT is to be secured every 10 feet (3 feet from junction boxes 
and equipment).
Article 392 Cable Trays
Cable trays are often used around arrays to manage wires. PV wire 
is allowed in cable trays, as we can see in 690.31(C)(2) Cable Tray
on pages 110–114.
Chapter 4 Equipment for General Use
Article 400 Flexible Cords and Cables
Referenced earlier in this book on pages 115 and 116, these 
cables are often used for solar trackers, which follow the sun, 
and for storage batteries. See 690.31(C)(4) Flexible Cords and 
Cables Connected to Tracking PV Arrays. Additionally, see Table 
690.31(C)(4) Minimum PV Wire Strands and 690.31(C)(5) Flexible, 
Fine-Stranded Cables.Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C 281
Article 480 Storage Batteries
See Chapter 10 storage with Article 480 Stationary Standby 
Batteries starting on page 256.
Article 495 Equipment over 1000V ac, 1500V dc, 
Nominal [formerly Article 490 in 2020 NEC]
490.2 High voltage is defined as 1000V ac and 1500V dc for this 
article. In the previous version of the NEC, it was just 1000V (did 
not specify ac or dc; however, 690 made it 1500V dc and modified 
Chapter 4).
For PV systems over 1000V, the 2023 NEC 690.31(G) Over 
1000V was covered on page 122.
Complying with Article 495 is possible, yet difficult, which is 
why we are not seeing 2000V PV arrays yet, at the time of this 
writing, but stay tuned…
Chapter 5 Special Occupancies
If you are installing a PV system in a barn, on a gas station, an air￾craft hangar, or other special occupancy, you will need to comply 
with the special requirements in Chapter 5 Special Occupancies.
Some examples of special occupancies where you may be 
installing PV are:
• hazardous locations
• commercial garages
• aircraft hangars
• gas stations (boom!)
• bulk storage plants
• facilities using flammable liquids
• health care facilities
• assembly occupancies (for over 100 people)
• theaters
• amusement parks
• carnivals (fun!)
• motion picture studios
• motion picture projection rooms
• manufactured buildings282 Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C
• agricultural buildings (what the hay?)
• mobile homes (classy!)
• recreational vehicles
• floating buildings
• marinas (wet!)
Just remember, if you are installing PV in a special place, such 
as one of the locations listed above, you should take Chapter 5 into 
consideration.
Chapter 6 Special Equipment
Article 690, which is what most of this book covers, is the most 
important article in Chapter 6 Special Equipment, and there are 
more articles that may relate to PV installations that we shall 
mention, such as:
625 Electric Vehicle Power Transfer System (bidirectional char￾ging/discharging)
645 Information Technology Equipment
646 Modular Data Centers
647 Sensitive Electronic Equipment
670 Industrial Machinery
680 Swimming Pools, Fountains, and Similar Installations
682 Natural and Artificially Made Bodies of Water
692 Fuel Cell Systems
694 Wind Electric Systems (our friends)
If your PV system incorporates wind, fuel cells, or electric car 
charging or is a floating PV system (floatovoltaics), you should 
look to other articles in Chapter 6 Special Equipment.
Chapter 7 Special Conditions
There are many other special conditions besides the interconnec￾tion to the grid, which we already covered in Chapter 9 of this 
book, where we covered Article 705. We also already covered other 
special conditions in this book in Chapter 10 where we covered 
energy storage related articles, such as Article 706 Energy Storage 
Systems and, Article 710 Stand-Alone Systems. Other articles Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C 283
in Chapter 7 Special Conditions that we may have to reference 
include:
702 Optional Standby Systems (see page 261)
720 Circuits and Equipment Operating at Less than 50V
750 Energy Management Systems (see pages 222–228)
Chapter 8 Communication Systems
Chapter 8 Communication Systems is not subject to the 
requirements of Chapters 1–7 of the NEC except where referenced 
in Chapter 8. These systems are separate from PV systems, 
although they may be powered by solar energy. As solar and 
energy storage integrate more with the internet, and there is talk 
of using blockchain technology, AI, and IT for energy and power 
transactions, we may have to increase the length of this chapter in 
the future by a few kilobytes.
Chapter 9 Tables
Chapter 9 tables are referenced throughout the NEC. We will look 
at a few tables that relate to PV system design that will let us know 
about voltage drop and how many conductors we can physically 
fit in conduit.
Chapter 9 Table 1 Percent of Cross Section of Conduit and 
Tubing for Conductors and Cables is used to determine how much 
of the cross-sectional area of a conduit can be used for wire and 
how much extra space needs to be left over for air, cooling, and 
pulling wires. This table is really about geometry and how many 
circles can fit in a circle. There are three categories in this table. One 
conductor in a conduit, which is unusual, can take up 53% of the 
space inside of the conduit. Two conductors in a conduit, which is 
also not common, can only take up 31% of the cross-sectional area 
in the conduit. When we have three or more conductors in conduit, 
which is usually the case, we can take up 40% of the cross-sectional 
area of the conduit.
Chapter 9 Table 4 Dimensions and Percent Area of Conduit and 
Tubing is used to determine the interior cross-sectional area of 
conduit and can be used with Chapter 9 Table 1. This table covers 
many types of conduit and is many pages long. Additionally, this 284 Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C
table gives us the data for the percentages of cross-sectional area 
that are required by Chapter 9 Table 1, so we do not need to even 
look at Chapter 9 Table 1 when we are using Chapter 9 Table 4.
For example, the common conduit used for residential PV 
projects is 3/4-inch EMT and we can use Chapter 9 Table 4 to see 
that 40% of the interior cross-sectional area of 3/4-inch EMT is 
0.213 square inches. This is how much space we can use without 
wires and we will see how much space the wires take up next.
Chapter 9 Table 5 Dimensions of Insulated Conductors and 
Fixture Wires can be used to determine the cross-sectional area 
dimensions of wires. Like Chapter 9 Table 4, this table is many 
pages long. This table is also used with Chapter 9 Table 4.
An example of the dimensions of a commonly used wire in 
the PV industry would be using this table to determine the cross￾sectional dimensions of 10 AWG THWN-2. We go down the left 
column until we see THHN, THWN, THWN-2, which all have 
the same dimensions, and we can see that 10 AWG THWN-2 has a 
cross-sectional area of 0.0211 square inches.
If we use our examples from Chapter 9 Tables 4 and 5, we can 
divide the cross-sectional area of 3/4-inch EMT, which is 0.213 
square inches, by the cross-sectional area of 10 AWG THWN-2, 
which is 0.0211 square inches, and we get:
0.0213/0.0211 = 10.1 conductors
We have to round down to 10 conductors in this example to fit 
in this conduit. We will see a little later in this chapter that we can 
use Informative Annex C to cut down on math.
Rounding up for number of conductors in conduit: Chapter 9 
Note 7 [a.k.a. 9.0(7)] tells us that we can round up if we are 0.8 over 
a whole number when calculating the number of conductors that 
will physically fit inside a conduit.
People in the field do not like using the maximum number of 
conductors that can fit in a conduit, because a tight fit can be very 
difficult to work with. It is recommended to have extra space. 
This is where there is often a disconnect between the engineers 
designing the PV system and the swearing installers in the field 
trying to cram conductors in conduit.
Chapter 9 Table 8 Conductor Properties is used often to calcu￾late voltage drop, but there are also other convenient properties Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C 285
of this table. In our discussion of wire sizing in Chapter 12 of this 
book, we will use Chapter 9 Table 8 for calculating voltage drop, 
using the resistance values in ohm per kilofoot (kFT) in order to 
determine the resistance of a wire.
For instance, we can see that an uncoated copper-stranded 10 
AWG wire has a resistance of 1.24 ohms per kFT. This means that 
1000 feet of 10 AWG wire has a resistance of 1.24 ohms, so 500 
feet would have half of that. One thing in this table that often 
confuses people is the uncoated vs. coated column in this table. 
The coated wire is usually a copper wire that was dipped and has 
a tinplating on it to help with corrosion. We most often do not use 
coated wire and this coating has nothing to do with the wire having 
insulation, as is often confused.
Chapter 9 Table 8 also has the metric cross-sectional area of the 
wire. In most of the world, square mm cross-sectional area is used 
to designate a wire’s dimensions rather than the AWG system. Here 
we can use this table to convert.
We can also see wire dimensions in circular mils. A circular mil 
is the cross-sectional area of a circle with a diameter of 1/1000 of an 
inch (very small). Often larger wires are measured in thousands of 
circular mils (kcmil).
Chapter 9 Table 9 Alternating-Current Resistance and 
Reactance for 600-Volt Cables, 3-Phase, 60Hz, 75°C—Three Single 
Conductors in Conduit is used to calculate ac voltage drop for 
larger conductors. With larger conductors, there is a greater diffe￾rence between ac and dc with regards to voltage drop.
Skin effect is when the alternating current tends to ride on the 
outer “skin” of the wire with larger wires, thus making ac less effi￾cient than dc with larger wires. This is one reason that larger wires 
are run in parallel, such as when you see multiples of three wires 
running along huge utility power poles. This is also why there are 
high voltage dc (HVDC) transmission lines popping up around 
the world, with some over 1MV!
There are also more variables with these calculations, such as the 
type of conduit, the power factor, and copper vs. aluminum wire.
With wires smaller than 250 kcmil, the difference between using 
Chapter 9 Table 8 and Chapter 9 Table 9 is usually less than 5% 
more voltage drop.
Table 10 deals with the number of strands in typical cables. 
The most common conductors use Class B stranding. Standard 286 Chs. 1–4, Ch. 9 Tables, and Annex C
terminals are designed for Class B stranded conductors. For higher 
strand counts, as is required for tracking systems in 690.31(C)
(4) Flexible Cords and Cables Connected to Tracking PV Arrays
page 115 and Table 690.31(C)(4) Minimum Wire Strands, special 
connectors are required to properly terminate the conductors [see 
690.31(C)(5), page 116]. Most PV modules have Class C or similar 
stranded PV wire for the module leads.
Informative Annexes
Further in the back of the NEC are Informative Annexes and 
Informative Annex C Conduit and Tubing Fill Tables for Conductors 
and Fixture Wires of the Same Size (long name) is especially useful 
for determining how many conductors fit in a conduit, in many 
cases avoiding the math involved with using the tables in Chapter 9.
If we wanted to arrive at fitting ten 10 AWG THWN-2 
conductors in a 3/4-inch EMT conduit, we can look for THWN-2 
in the left column of Informative Annex C and, a few pages in, we 
see THWN-2, we match 10 AWG with 3/4-inch EMT, and can see 
that ten conductors fit. Informative Annex C does not work for 
conductors of different sizes within the same conduit.
Informative Annexes are not part of the requirements of the 
Code but contain helpful shortcuts.
Index
Last but not least in the NEC is the Index, which contains every￾thing from ac to zones. Become familiar with the index and use it 
often, especially if you are planning on taking an open book NEC 
exam or need to fall asleep fast without damaging your liver. The 
smartest people know how to use the index.
Since we are talking about the index here, “index” shall be in the 
index of this book.
We have now covered PV and the NEC. The next and final 
chapter will use the NEC by working out wire sizing examples. DOI: 10.4324/9781003189862-13
12 PV Wire Sizing Examples
Wire sizing has been so complicated that many experts disagree 
on how to correctly size a wire and many books have conflicting 
methods for how to do it properly. This is also why there are 
no wire sizing programs on the internet that work for anything 
besides voltage drop. If someone was good enough at coding 
to make a good wire sizing program, they would be too busy at 
Google making $333k per year instead of making NEC wire sizing 
programs.
In sizing a wire there are many different checks that should be 
done. Some of the checks seem so obvious that they are usually 
skipped, while others are sometimes just given a brief statement 
such as “then check that the overcurrent device satisfies Article 240 
Overcurrent Protection.”
We will give a few examples of wire sizing and then let you prac￾tice on your own. Practice makes perfect. Someone who sizes PV 
wires every day will often skip most checks, since they know from 
experience which check will determine the wire size in their par￾ticular situation.
It is recommended that you sit down with your NEC and use 
the following tables to practice these wire sizing exercises. You can 
also photocopy or screenshot the following tables and rules for 
your wire sizing kit:

Wire Sizing Example 1: Inverter Output Circuit Wire Sizing
Given the following information:
• Inverter continuous rated output current = 10A
• If it were on a house, then 240V × 10A = 2.4kW inverter
• Number of current-carrying conductors in conduit 2
• Do not include ground or balanced neutral
• ASHRAE 2% high temperature from www.solarabcs.org/per￾mitting = 40°C
• Distance above roof conduit in sunlight = 1 inch (irrelevant info 
using 2023 NEC)
• Terminal temperature limits = 75°C
• Terminals are what we attach ends of wires to.
• Wire type to be used = THWN-2
• 90°C rated wire
• We can see this in Table 310.15(B)(16)
• -2 at end of wire designation means 90°C ratedPV Wire Sizing Examples 289
Discussion
Defining current for this exercise:
690.8(A)(1)(c) [page 40]
Maximum circuit current = continuous rated output 
current = 10A = Imax
690.8(B)(1) [page 42]
Required ampacity for continuous current = Imax × 
1.25 = 12.5A = Icont
This example and these steps use a 90°C rated wire and 75°C rated 
terminals.
We are going to break this down into 10 steps (at least it’s not 12 
steps—although you might need to recover with a 12-step program 
after we are done). Some of the steps will seem useless in most 
cases, but it is possible to have a 75°C rated wire with 90°C rated 
terminals, although we have never seen it happen. We could make 
fewer steps and then find an unusual exception where the four-step 
process does not work.
10 Steps (Almost as Effective as a 12-Step 
Program—This Is Ampacity Anonymous)
Step 1 is really without wires (we are powerless, and our electrical 
systems are unmanageable). If you end up picking a wire that is 
too small in one of the steps, then you go to a higher size.
The way Sean does it is he puts the following 10 steps in an 
editable document and then follows the steps as seen below. When 
he is consulting, he finds that over 90% of people calculate wrong 
and end up using a more efficient wire than the minimum required, 
which is probably good in the long run.
(1) Round up Icont to fuse size
(2) Pick conductor size [perhaps from intuition, Tables 310.16, 
310.17, or 240.4(D)]
(3) 75°C ampacity
(4) 75°C ampacity ≥ Icont good!
(5) 75°C ampacity ≥ OCPD good!290 PV Wire Sizing Examples
(6) 90°C ampacity
(7) 90°C ampacity ≥ OCPD good!
(8) 90°C ampacity × COU deratings = COU derated wire
(9) COU derated wire ≥ Imax good!
(10) COU derated wire round up to OCPD ≥ OCPD from step 
1 good!
Working the 10 Steps with Our Example 1
(1) Round up Icont to fuse size
• 12.5A rounds up to 15A
• 240.6
(2) Pick conductor size
• Educated guess or from 240.4(D)
• 14 AWG copper is smallest wire from 240.4(D)
(3) 75°C ampacity (75°C terminals)
• 14 AWG = 20A
• Table 310.15(B)(16) conduit or (B)(17) if free air
(4) 75°C Ampacity ≥ Icont good!
• 20A ≥ 12.5A good!
• If not good, increase the conductor size here
(5) 75°C Ampacity ≥ OCPD good!
• 20A ≥ 15A good!
• If not good, increase the conductor size
(6) 90°C ampacity (90°C rated wire)
• 14 AWG = 25A
• Table 310.15(B)(16) conduit or (B)(17) if free air
(7) 90°C ampacity ≥ OCPD good!
• 25A ≥ 15A good
• If not good, increase the conductor size here
(8) 90°C ampacity × COU deratings = COU derated wire
• COU = Conditions of Use
• COU deratings from 310.15(B)(1)(1) and 310.15(C)(1)
• 310.15(B)(1)(1) 40°C for 90°C rated wire = 0.91 derating
• 310.15(C)(1) no derating for two current-carrying conductors
• Do not count balanced neutral and ground
• 25A wire × 0.91 = 23A rounded to nearest whole number
(9) COU derated wire ≥ Imax good!
• 23A ≥ 10APV Wire Sizing Examples 291
(10) COU derated wire round up to OCPD ≥ OCPD from step 
1 good!
• 23A wire rounds up to 25A
• 25A ≥ 15A
Conclusion: 14 AWG wire satisfies the requirements of the code. 
In this case, however, most people would use a larger wire due to 
voltage drop. Ten years ago, everyone used a 10 AWG wire, and 
today many people still use a 10 AWG wire, but the less expensive 
PV 12 AWG wire is becoming more common, and the 14 AWG 
wire does not violate the NEC.
Step 10: Rounding Up Wire to Common Overcurrent Device
One of the most difficult concepts for people to get is that, 
in step 10, we can take the ampacity of the wire and round up 
to the next standard overcurrent protection device size. This 
is not saying that the conductor has a higher ampacity; this is 
just saying that a wire derated to 23A can be protected by a 
slightly larger sized OCPD and still be safe. This rounding 
up comes from 240.4(B) Overcurrent Devices Rated 800A 
or less (also seen on page 53). For overcurrent devices over 
800A, you do not get to round up the ampacity of the con￾ductor over the overcurrent device size, which seems to make 
more sense.
Wire sizing for voltage drop is a good idea, but it is never a Code 
issue for PV with the NEC. We will do voltage drop calculations 
later in this chapter, after we focus on Code-compliant wire sizing.
Wire Sizing Example 2: PV String Circuit Wire Sizing (a 2023 
NEC PV String Circuit Is a Type of PV Source Circuit)
Sizing a PV string circuit given the following information:
• Isc = 8A
• Number of PV string circuits in a conduit = 20
• ASHRAE 2% high temperature from www.solarabcs.org/per￾mitting = 40°C292 PV Wire Sizing Examples
• Distance above roof conduit in sunlight = 1 inch
• Terminal temperature limits = 75°C
• Wire type to be used = THWN-2
Discussion
Defining current:
690.8(A)(1)(a)(1) [Page 35]
Maximum circuit current = Isc × 1.25 = 8A × 1.25 = 10A = Imax 
(Imax is different from, and not to be confused with, Imp)
Required ampacity for continuous current:
690.8(B)(1) [page 42]
Required ampacity for continuous current = Imax × 
1.25 = 12.5A = Icont
(Icont = Isc × 1.25 × 1.25 = Isc × 1.56)
Conductors:
THWN-2 = 90°C rated wire and we are using 75°C terminals as 
mentioned.
20 PV source circuits = 40 current-carrying conductors
Working the 10 Steps with Our Example 2
(1) Round up Icont to fuse size
• Icont = 12.5A rounds up to 15A fuse as per 240.6
(2) Pick conductor size
• 15A fuse requires at least 14 AWG copper as per 240.4(D)
(3) 75°C ampacity (75°C terminals)
• 75°C 14 AWG = 20A as per Table 310.16
(4) 75°C Ampacity ≥ Icont good!
• 20A ≥ 12.5A good!
(5) 75°C Ampacity ≥ OCPD good!
• 20A ≥ 15A good!
(6) 90°C ampacity (90°C rated wire)
• 14 AWG = 25A per Table 310.16PV Wire Sizing Examples 293
(7) 90°C ampacity ≥ OCPD good!
• 25A ≥ 15A good
(8) 90°C ampacity × COU deratings = COU derated wire
• 310.15(B)(1)(1) 40°C for 90°C rated wire = 0.91 derating
• 310.15(C)(1) for 40 conductors in conduit = 40% = 0.4
• 25A wire × 0.91 × 0.4 = 9A rounded to nearest 
whole number
(9) COU derated wire ≥ Imax good!
• 9A is not ≥ 10A, so go back to use next larger wire 12 AWG
• 12 AWG = 30A per Table 310.16
• 30A × 0.91 × 0.4 = 11A rounded to nearest whole number
• 11A ≥ 10A (notice we are not using Icont here)
(10) COU derated wire round up to OCPD ≥ OCPD from step 
1 good!
• 11A wire rounds up to 15A as per 240.6
• 15A ≥ 15A
Conclusion: 12 AWG satisfies the requirements of the Code here. 
It is interesting to note that the condition of use rated wire is 11A 
and we can round that up to 15A and have an 11A wire protected 
by a 15A overcurrent protection device! If you go to Europe, you 
will see that their wires can carry more current for the same size 
wire than AWG wires can. We have a buffer of protection built into 
our wires that will let us seem to deny common sense and round up 
a wire’s ability to carry current.
Would we use a 12 AWG wire here in reality? I think I would use 
a 10 AWG wire, just to be safe and simple. We do not want to push 
our luck here with what we have learned in Chapter 12.
Voltage Drop (Rise)
When it comes down to voltage drop (rise), what we really want 
to know is how much money our wire will save for us if we invest 
more money in the wire. There may be complex calculations, which 
would have to include tilt, azimuth, copper prices, aluminum prices, 
PV prices, soiling, labor prices, inverter prices, incentive type, PV 
to inverter ratio, and weather. To perform those calculations, it 
is recommended to use complex software and perhaps to hire a 
team of engineers (or do what everyone else does and use a 10 
AWG wire).294 PV Wire Sizing Examples
Voltage Rise
The reason that we keep mentioning voltage rise in this 
book, is because the voltage must be at least slightly higher 
where the electricity is coming from, than where it is going 
to. The difference in voltage is determined by the resistance 
of the conductor and the current (V=IR). With a source, the 
voltage will be higher at the source, so with your typical inter￾active inverter output circuit, the voltage will be higher at the 
inverter than at the point of interconnection, and will rise even 
more as the sun gets brighter (current goes up). This is really 
voltage drop, but it appears as voltage rise from the inverter’s 
point of view as the inverter pushes current towards the grid. 
According to an interactive inverter, the grid is a load!
For the purposes of this book, we will use the maximum output 
current of the inverter, which is being very conservative, since most 
if not all the energy generated from a PV system is going to be less 
than the maximum output current. For PV source circuits, we will 
use current at maximum power (Imp), which is considerably less 
than the currents we used to calculate Code-compliant wire sizes 
and is more than we will often see on a PV source circuit.
Some designers will use 80% of these numbers as a rule of 
thumb, since most of our energy is made when it is not a cold, 
windy, bright summer noon (optimal PV conditions). We will use 
Imp and inverter maximum output current for this book, which 
is conservative and leads to less energy loss over the year than 
voltage drop percentage in the calculation.
If you are performing voltage drop calculations for a job that 
you have won a bid on or are bidding on, you should carefully read 
the requirements of the request for proposal.
We will use a simple calculation to arrive at an AWG wire size 
given the following information:
Voltage = 240V
Current = 16A
Voltage Drop Percentage = 2%
Distance from inverter to interconnection = 200 feetPV Wire Sizing Examples 295
Here is the formula that can be used with Chapter 9 Table 8 of 
the NEC
Ohms/kFT = (5 × % × V)/(I × L)
Ohms/kFT will give us an AWG wire size in Chapter 9 Table 8
5 is a constant derived from (1000FT/kFt)/100%/2 wires in a 
circuit)
% is the percentage, so we use 2 (not 0.02) for 2%
V is the operating voltage, which is 240V at your house
I is the current of the inverter in this case, which is 16A for a 3.8kW 
inverter
L is the 1-way distance in feet which is 200 FT
We will plug it in to the equation:
Ohms/kFT = (5 × % × V)/(I × L)
Ohms kFT V A FT
ohms kFT
/ % /
/ . /
= × ( × ) ( × ) = =
5 2 240 16 200
2400 3200 0 75
If we look up 0.75 ohms/kFT in Chapter 9 Table 8 we see that an 
uncoated 6 AWG copper wire will have a resistance of 0.491 ohms/
kFT and a smaller 8 AWG stranded copper wire will have a resist￾ance of 0.778 ohms/kFT.
Since voltage drop is not a Code issue here, you can choose to 
round up or down from a 6 AWG or an 8 AWG wire.
This calculation will work for ac and dc wires because the values 
in Table 9 are essentially the same for ac circuits running at unity 
power factor. If you are using a large wire for ac and running the 
circuits at a power factor of 0.85 (may be required occasionally 
by utilities for grid support), then the values in Table 9 differ from 
those in Table 8. It’s best to get an engineer involved for larger 
systems as these calculations can get complicated.
To use these calculations for 3-phase power, just remember that 
there is a benefit to using 3-phase that is proportional to the square 
root of 3 (about 1.73). If we divide the square root of 3 by 2 we get 
0.886, so we will have 88.6% of the resistance with 3-phase wires or 
we can multiply our ohms/kFT answer by 0.866. In the example we 296 PV Wire Sizing Examples
used, instead of 0.778 ohms/kFT, we could use a wire that is 0.778 
× 0.866 = 0.67 ohms per kFT for 240V 3-phase.
The reason we divide the square root of 3 by 2 is because, with 
3-phase, our currents are not directly opposing each other (square 
root of 3) and we are converting from a calculation that is from 
single phase power where we have to double the one-way distance 
of our wire to calculate the resistance of a circuit.
A circuit is a circle and if you are going to have your inverter 200 
feet from the interconnection, you need to run electrons through 
400 feet of wire and will have 400 feet = 0.4 kFT of resistance. 
With 3-phase, you will need to have current on three wires, but it 
will be less current, since the currents are 120 degrees out of phase 
with each other.
Figure 12.1 Nikola Tesla demonstrates how to truly understand 3-phase 
in 1899.PV Wire Sizing Examples 297
Some people say that 3-phase power takes more than a lifetime 
to truly understand, but if Tesla (a crazy genius) could figure out 
how 3-phase power worked all on his own, you can too!
