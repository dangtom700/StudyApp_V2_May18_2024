Preface
The rapidly evolving field of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has been a beacon 
of hope and possibilities for countless couples struggling with infertility. The history of 
ART dates back to the birth of the first “test-tube baby,” Louise Brown, in 1978, marking a 
milestone in the successful application of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Since then, ART has 
undergone significant advancements, encompassing a range of techniques. As ART labs 
continue to innovate, maintaining high-quality standards and adhering to best practices 
becomes increasingly crucial.
Quality Control in Assisted Reproductive Technology Labs is a comprehensive guide 
designed to provide embryologists, clinicians, lab technicians, and other stakeholders 
with an in-depth understanding of the quality control measures required in IVF labs and 
practical guidance on their effective implementation.
Drawing on real-life case studies, examples of logs and SOPs, and lessons learned from 
mishaps in IVF labs around the world, this book highlights the importance of quality 
control and offers practical insights and strategies for enhancing the efficiency and overall 
performance of ART labs. By focusing on both the technical and human aspects of quality 
control, this guide aims to equip readers with the knowledge and tools needed to consis￾tently deliver the highest standard of care.
The guide provides insights into the complex regulatory compliance landscape, with 
an overview of ART lab regulations from various countries. The diversity of legal frame￾works and the challenges faced by professionals working in different regulatory environ￾ments are clearly laid out.
The content herein has been carefully curated to empower professionals in the ART field 
to provide exceptional care to their patients, continuously improve their practices, and 
drive the field of assisted reproduction forward.
In conclusion, I express my deepest gratitude to everyone who contributed to this proj￾ect. My profound thanks go to Dr S Vyjayanthi for her instrumental guidance and Dr M. 
Prasad for generously sharing his scientific insights. I would like to extend my apprecia￾tion to the management of KIMS Hospital for their unwavering support. I sincerely thank 
Robert Peden, the commissioning editor, for his guidance throughout this journey.
I am grateful to my family for their support and encouragement. I also wish to acknowl￾edge the resilience of all professionals and patients in the ART field, whose experiences 
have greatly enriched this book. Finally, thanks to the entire editorial and production team 
for their attention to detail, ensuring a high-quality final product.
This book is a testament to the power of collective knowledge and the relentless pursuit 
of excellence in the field of ART. As we move forward, I hope this resource serves as an 
essential tool, contributing to this field’s continued success and evolution.DOI: 10.1201/9781032622736-1 1

Introduction to QC in ART Labs
There are three principles in the field of assisted reproductive technology (ART), quality 
control (QC), quality assurance (QA), and good laboratory practices (GLPs), that serve as 
the pillars of laboratory operation. The foremost objective of QC is to ensure that labora￾tory processes and outcomes meet quality standards; this entails monitoring the perfor￾mance of equipment, handling samples, and thorough testing of products to identify and 
resolve any potential issues.
On the other hand, QA focuses on maintaining the high quality benchmarks established 
by QC methods. Key components of QA include developing and implementing standard 
operating procedures (SOPs), conducting external audits, and regularly evaluating labora￾tory procedures to identify areas for improvement.
GLPs constitute a framework to ensure the reliability, repeatability, and accuracy of labo￾ratory results. This is achieved through training of personnel, recording of data, and dili￾gent maintenance of equipment. The synergy between QC, QA, and GLP creates a system 
that enhances accuracy in ART laboratories, strengthening the validation of results.
To ensure the integration of QC, QA, and GLP in ART facilities, it is essential to have 
defined goals and measurable standards for evaluating performance. The implementation 
of key performance indicators (KPIs) plays a role in achieving this. By monitoring and 
assessing KPIs, ART laboratories can pinpoint any issues and take the necessary actions to 
improve the effectiveness of their processes.
The interplay between QC, QA, and GLP within ART laboratories is crucial for main￾taining a quality management system. QC primarily concentrates on monitoring equip￾ment performance and managing sample handling processes to ensure consistency across 
parameters. Whenever any inconsistencies are detected, QA measures such as audits come 
into play, facilitating corrective actions to rectify the issues.
Standard operating procedures are the outcome of QA efforts and play a role in bringing 
uniformity to laboratory procedures. By establishing protocols, SOPs directly contribute to 
the accuracy and reproducibility of lab results.
GLP specifically emphasises personnel training, ensuring that laboratory staff possess 
the required skills for their designated roles. Moreover, GLP principles advocate for data 
documentation and practical storage systems, which ultimately promote accurate results 
recording.
In the context of ART laboratories, QC serves as an approach to inspecting and monitor￾ing laboratory processes. Its primary objective is to achieve predictable results while mini￾mising errors. The ultimate goal of QC in ART labs is to optimise the success rate of ART 
techniques and to enhance care. Any inconsistencies or deviations can have consequences 
for treatment outcomes, impacting the emotional and financial well-being of patients.
Internal quality control (IQC) and external quality control (EQC) play roles in monitor￾ing and assessing laboratory processes. For example, environmental monitoring in ART 
labs involves checks on air quality, water quality, and surfaces to identify contaminants. 
Additionally, regular calibration of equipments, assessment of media quality evaluations 
of personnel competency, and quality control testing are components of QC in ART labs.2 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
1.1 Schematic Overview
To effectively understand and implement quality measures in an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) 
laboratory, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the IVF lab process to 
help identify points and areas where errors may occur during operations.
This schematic approach does not assist in problem-solving; instead, it highlights areas 
that may require more attention or improvement. By providing a framework for examin￾ing the IVF process, it ensures that every step in the process is carefully considered and all 
possible concerns are adequately addressed (Figure 1.1).
The Role of QC: ART procedures such as in vito fertilisation (IVF), intracytoplas￾mic sperm injection (ICSI), and preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) are intricate 
and costly. Hence, a comprehensive QC programme is indispensable for ensuring 
safety and optimising treatment effectiveness. The key roles of QC in ART labs 
include safeguarding well-being, enhancing ART outcomes, adhering to regula￾tions and standards, and providing reassurance to patients.

Internal Quality Control and 
External Quality Control
2.1 Control Samples
Control samples play a role in evaluating the accuracy and dependability of test results. 
They help ensure that the outcomes are in line with expectations and serve as a way to 
identify any inconsistencies or positive indications.
To maintain consistency, laboratories establish acceptance criteria that define the 
expected range for control sample outcomes. These samples are evaluated using the same 
methodologies. If the observed results deviate from the predetermined range, steps should 
be taken to investigate and address any anomalies.
When it comes to control samples, readily available products are often preferred due to 
their user-friendly nature and traceability to reference standards. They enable monitoring 
of semen test precision in terms of count, motility, and morphology.
Alternatively, laboratories can also recommend using in-house–prepared controls. These 
customised control samples can be tailored to testing situations and may prove cost effec￾tive as well as meeting sample requirements.

evaluations of the assessment protocols.
2.12 Process of Troubleshooting in the ART Lab
Procedures encompass a series of systematic actions and cautious manipulation of materi￾als. It is imperative to employ efficient problem-solving techniques to prioritise the well￾being of patients, enhance the rates of successful treatment, and uphold one’s reputation. 
This process entails the identification, diagnosis, and resolution of any potential issues 
that may occur during various stages of ART (Figure 2.1).
2.13 Identifying the Issue
• Be familiar with SOPs and expected outcomes for oocyte retrieval, sperm prepara￾tion, fertilisation, embryo culture, and embryo transfer.
• Stay vigilant for unexpected or unusual values that may indicate issues within the 
lab’s practices. These could include poor fertilisation rates, embryo arrest, or low 
implantation rates.
FIGURE 2.1
Steps in ART lab troubleshooting.Internal Quality Control and External Quality Control 17
2.14 Gathering Information
• Review the records of the procedures performed to check if there were any devia￾tions from the SOPs that might explain the issue.
• Check the logs of the equipment used to see if there were any maintenance, cali￾bration, or usage problems that could have contributed to the problem.
• Assess the quality and expiration dates of the reagents used in the procedures, 
since compromised reagents can affect the outcomes.
• Take into consideration factors like temperature, humidity, and air quality, as they 
can influence ART techniques and their outcomes.
• Organise patient demographics and outcomes to thoroughly analyse the issue.
• Analyse all the collected information to identify the root cause(s) of the problem.
2.15 Consulting Resources
• Scientific literature: To understand the identified problem, it is advisable to con￾duct an examination of pertinent research papers, case studies, and protocols to 
explore its potential origins.
• Optimal methodologies for the industry: When confronted with particular chal￾lenges, it is recommended to consult authoritative guidelines from reputable 
organisations such as the ESHRE or the ASRM.
• Engaging in discussions through forums and communities of experts can be ben￾eficial. Advice can be sought from peers and professionals who have faced diffi￾culties, and experiences can be shared to explore alternative solutions.
• Strategic approach: To tackle identified problems, it is important to develop an 
approach by utilising collected data and available resources. This will help formu￾late a plan.
• Assessing the urgency and importance of the problem by considering its impact 
on operations.
• Identify potential solutions: The process of identifying potential solutions involves 
creating a comprehensive inventory. This inventory, derived from the collected 
data, includes potential solutions and corrective actions that could address opera￾tional issues.
• Practicality evaluation: The analysis of the viability of each prospective solution 
requires consideration of factors such as financial implications, time constraints, 
and available resources.
• Optimal course of action: The course of determining the most appropriate 
solution is based on the solution’s practicality and its alignment with goals 
and priorities.
• Sequential strategy: The task of developing a comprehensive blueprint involves 
clearly defining the necessary methods.18 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
• An organised framework should consistently track the advancement of the chosen 
solution, and its efficiency should be evaluated in terms of addressing the identi￾fied problem.
2.16 Executing the Result
• Assign roles and responsibilities to each team member to effectively manage the 
project.
• Provide training and guidance to laboratory personnel to ensure they have the 
knowledge and skills to contribute effectively to the success of the project.
• Regularly monitor progress by comparing actual results with established time￾lines and milestones. If there are any deviations from the plan, make adjustments 
accordingly.
• Maintain lines of communication with team members, management, and other 
stakeholders involved in the project; this will facilitate addressing any questions, 
concerns, or issues that may arise during the execution phase.
• Always prioritise safety by adhering to all safety guidelines and preventive mea￾sures while carrying out the project.
2.17 Monitoring Progress
• Establish KPIs: Define specific metrics and benchmarks to measure the effective￾ness of the action and its impact on outcomes or equipment performance.
• Collect data: Gather data on the relevant KPIs through observation and analysis, 
both during and after the rendering of solutions.
• Compare results: Compare the collected data to the established benchmarks and 
targets to assess whether the applied result delivers the desired outcomes and 
resolves the issue effectively.
• Regular evaluations: The periodic evaluations are not only to assess the compe￾tency of embryologists but also to gauge the effectiveness of the troubleshooting 
process.
• Adjust as required: Based on the empirical data obtained from continuous moni￾toring, it is recommended to make necessary modifications to the formulated 
alternative strategies in case the initial solution fails to yield the expected results.
2.18 Communication
• Comprehensive record-keeping on the recognised issue is essential for accelerat￾ing the procedure of identifying and executing a suitable action. This will func￾tion as a reference point for the purpose of providing information.Internal Quality Control and External Quality Control 19
• Hold team meetings or training sessions: It is recommended to schedule team 
meetings or training sessions when the issue at hand is significant or when fixing 
it leads to changes in SOPs.
• Update SOPs and educational resources: To ensure that everyone is aware of the 
changes made during the problem-solving course, it is essential to make altera￾tions to SOP training guides. In this way, all relevant information regarding the 
solutions can be readily available.
• Notify management or regulatory authorities: Whenever deemed necessary, share 
the outcomes of your troubleshooting exercise with management, regulatory 
agencies, or any other external stakeholders involved.
• Conduct reviews: These reviews should be scheduled periodically to evaluate the 
effectiveness of methods and identify areas where improvements can be made.
• Following these steps for communicating results after resolving an issue estab￾lishes protocols, promotes internal awareness through meetings/training ses￾sions, updates relevant resources appropriately, and maintains an open dialogue 
with relevant parties outside the organisation when required.
• It is also essential to involve all team members, and their insights and perspectives 
can help identify opportunities for improvement and create a sense of ownership 
and commitment among the team.
• Based on the insights gained from these reviews, input from staff members, and 
performance metrics, necessary changes should be implemented to enhance the 
efficiency of the restoration practice.
• It is important to monitor and evaluate these changes’ impact on both the pro￾cess itself and the overall performance of the lab, assessing whether these changes 
have led to greater effectiveness.
• Preventive measures: Preventive measures are crucial to avoid future issues and 
include the following actions: updating SOPs, regularly providing training for all 
staff members, and consistently maintaining and performing additional quality 
control checks.
• Regarding staff training, it is crucial to provide continuous development oppor￾tunities, including offering refresher courses to ensure that the staff is updated on 
the latest advancements in the industry.
• It is important to prioritise the maintenance and monitoring of lab equipment. 
Scheduling regular maintenance checks is key to identifying any signs of mal￾function, which in turn ensures optimal performance and reduces the likelihood 
of technical issues.
• It is advisable to conduct regular inspections to optimise quality control within 
the ART technique. Checks should encompass the examination of sample labels, 
the verification of identities, and the continuous monitoring of lab conditions.
• It is essential to cultivate a culture of communication within the lab. Staff mem￾bers should be encouraged to voice their concerns regarding any issues that 
may arise.
• One important task is to monitor and track errors. It is important to keep a record 
of any errors that occur in the lab in order to analyse this data and identify any 
recurring problems. This information can be used to take effective preventive 
measures and make any necessary adjustments to techniques.20 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
• It is important to keep in mind that every troubleshooting scenario is unique and 
will require specific actions based on the problem at hand.

Risk Management
Risk management is a critical element within the operational framework. This active pro￾cess systematically unveils, examines, and mitigates potential risks that could potentially 
disrupt the lab’s objectives or put patient safety at risk. Risks could stem from various 
sources, including equipment failure, biohazard exposure, procedural errors, or external 
factors such as natural disasters. Consequently, risk management aims to ensure that ART 
labs consistently and reliably deliver high-quality services.
Equipment failure: ART laboratories heavily rely on advanced technological equip￾ment, such as incubators, microscopes, cryopreservation systems, and microma￾nipulators, all integral to executing successful ART procedures. Despite their 
sophisticated design, these pieces of equipment are not immune to malfunction or 
failure. One of the leading causes of equipment failure is inadequate or irregular 
maintenance, which could result in sudden breakdowns, leading to disruptions in 
laboratory procedures.
Biohazard exposure: Exposure can occur through direct contact with the 
specimen, aerosols, spills, or accidental punctures with contaminated sharp 
objects. Inadequate or inappropriate specimen handling can lead to cross-con￾tamination, potential disease transmission to lab personnel, or even inadver￾tent specimen mix-ups or loss. It is worth noting that the risk extends beyond 
just the handling phase, including the storage and disposal of biohazardous 
materials.
Technical errors: These can range from basic clerical errors in the labelling and 
identification of samples, which can have devastating consequences like the mis￾handling of gametes or embryos, to more complex errors in the application of 
laboratory protocols, including culture media preparation, incorrect timing of the 
ART procedures, or incorrect assessment of embryos.
External factors: External factors, while less controllable, pose significant risks to 
ART laboratories. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, or fires can lead 
to abrupt and significant disruptions in laboratory operations, including equip￾ment damage, loss of power, and potentially irrevocable loss of stored biological 
specimens. Power outages, even short duration, can compromise the functioning 
of critical equipment such as incubators and cryotanks. Furthermore, cybersecu￾rity threats, a growing concern in today’s digitally dependent world, can lead to 
the loss of critical data, breach of patient confidentiality, or interference with the 
electronic operation of lab equipment.22 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
3.1 Risk Assessment
Risk assessment in ART laboratories is an essential process, central to ensuring the safety 
of both patients and personnel, the integrity of biological specimens, and the efficiency of 
laboratory procedures.
This process can be systematically carried out using several steps.
Identification of potential risks: It is a meticulous process that requires a complete under￾standing of laboratory operations, processes, equipment, and workflow. From the handling 
and storage of gametes and embryos to the functioning and maintenance of laboratory 
equipment, each component must be analysed for potential hazards.
Following the identification stage, each risk must be thoroughly evaluated through a 
risk assessment process. The goal here is to estimate the potential impact of each risk and 
the likelihood of its occurrence. The potential impact of a risk is measured in terms of its 
possible effects on patient outcomes, lab costs, or disruptions in the lab operation. A tool 
often used for this evaluation is the risk matrix.
3.2 Risk Matrix
In Table 3.1, each cell in the matrix represents a unique combination of risk likelihood and 
impact. For instance, ‘Frequent delays in routine tasks due to understaffing’ is a risk with 
a likelihood (4) and negligible impact (1), giving it a risk score of 4. Conversely, a ‘Mix-up 
of gametes leading to wrongful embryo transfer’ is a risk with almost a certain likelihood 
(5) and catastrophic impact (5), giving it the highest risk score of 25.
The goal of utilising such a matrix in an ART laboratory is to visually represent risks, aid￾ing in identifying high-priority risks that need immediate attention. This matrix enables 
lab management to prioritise their mitigation strategies and allocate resources accordingly 
to address the risks with the highest scores.
The final stage of the risk assessment process involves prioritising the identified risks. In 
this stage, risks are ranked based on their evaluated potential impact. Prioritisation is criti￾cal to effective risk management, as it helps laboratories focus their efforts and resources 
on mitigating the most severe and probable risks. Risks with high impact are typically 
addressed first, ensuring that the mitigation strategies offer the highest level of protection 
and prevention.
3.3 Risk Mitigation
Upon completing a thorough risk assessment, ART laboratories should focus on imple￾menting robust risk mitigation strategies. The ultimate goal of these strategies is to mini￾mise the potential impact of identified risks and enhance the safety, efficacy, and efficiency 
of lab operations.Quality Control Tools 23

Remember that this table is a simplified representation. In practice, each level of impact and likelihood and the resulting 
risk score would be thoroughly defined according to the specific context of each ART laboratory. It is crucial to regularly 
review and update the risk matrix in line with new technologies, changes in regulation, and new knowledge about 
potential risks.
Comprehensive equipment management is the first line of defence against the risk of 
equipment failure. A backup for essential equipment can make the difference between 
minor disruption and significant losses in the face of unexpected equipment failure.
Regarding biohazard control, SOPs should cover every aspect of specimen handling, 
from collection to disposal, to prevent cross-contamination, disease transmission, or spec￾imen loss.
Standardisation and documentation of all laboratory procedures are essential to mini￾mise procedural errors. This could involve creating written protocols for every process in 
the lab, from specimen handling to data recording. These protocols should be routinely 
reviewed and updated to reflect current best practices. Additionally, staff should receive 
ongoing training on these standardised procedures to ensure proficiency.24 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
Finally, preparing for external risks requires the development of comprehensive 
emergency response plans. These plans should envisage a variety of potential disrup￾tions, such as power outages, natural disasters, and cybersecurity attacks, and provide 
detailed, step-by-step guidance on how to respond to each scenario. A regular drill of 
these emergency plans can also help ensure a calm, coordinated response when faced 
with a real-life crisis.
While risk management is crucial in ART laboratories, embedding a risk mitigation cul￾ture throughout the organisation is equally important. Promoting this culture can begin 
with leadership. Laboratory managers and supervisors should demonstrate a commitment 
to risk management by establishing clear policies, investing in necessary resources for 
risk prevention and control, and reinforcing the importance of adherence to these poli￾cies. This can be achieved through regular communication on risk management topics, 
incorporation of risk management into strategic planning, and recognition or rewards for 
exemplary risk management practices.
Training sessions can cover various topics, including identifying and evaluating risks, 
understanding and applying risk management protocols, and learning from past incidents 
or near misses. Moreover, a structured boarding process for new staff that emphasises the 
importance of risk management can lay a strong foundation for their future work.
Furthermore, open communication and a blame-free culture can significantly enhance 
risk management in ART labs. Staff should feel encouraged to report potential risks or 
incidents without fear of blame or punishment. This encourages a proactive approach to 
risk identification and resolution. A nonpunitive approach to errors can also foster a learn￾ing culture, allowing the organisation to improve its risk management practices based on 
past experiences continuously.
Risk mitigation in ART laboratories is a multifaceted process that requires ongoing atten￾tion and review. By continuously monitoring and improving these strategies, ART labs can 
ensure the highest level of patient safety, safeguard precious biological specimens, and 
maintain operational efficiency under all circumstances.
3.4 Control Charts
Control charts are vital to quality control, as they allow laboratory analysts to monitor 
performance and to identify any deviations from expected values over time. They help 
detect variations in a process and determine if they are due to notable causes. In ART labs, 
control charts are used to ensure quality and maintain standards across processes and 
parameters.
3.5 Terms in Control Charts
Control chart: A  statistical tool that visually represents the changes in a process 
variable over time. For instance, a control chart can show the lab temperature or 
the rate of embryonic development. Control charts help assess the consistency and 
predictability of a process.Quality Control Tools 25
Process variables: These refer to characteristics or parameters that are monitored and 
managed in an ART lab. Examples include temperature, humidity, and embryonic 
development rate. It is crucial to have control over these variables for reliable out￾comes in the lab.
Control limits: These boundaries, determined statistically, define where a process 
variable is expected to operate under certain conditions. If the variable remains 
within these limits, it indicates that the process is under control. However, if the 
value goes beyond these boundaries, it implies the possibility of something hap￾pening and may require further investigation.
Common cause variation: This kind of variation refers to the fluctuations that occur 
in a process due to randomness. These fluctuations do not need any action, as they 
indicate that the process is operating under statistical control.
Cause variation: Special cause variation indicates uncommon fluctuations in a pro￾cess. These variations often result from various factors. Variation may suggest 
that the process is out of control, requiring additional investigation and corrective 
measures.
Upper control limit (UCL): The upper control limit on a control chart establishes 
the limit for process variation under normal conditions. If a variable exceeds this 
limit, it suggests a deviation from the behaviour of the process.
Lower control limit (LCL): In contrast, the lower control limit defines the accept￾able limit for process variation. If a variable falls below this limit, it indicates an 
abnormality.
Centreline: The centreline on a control chart represents either the target value or the 
process variable. Consistent alignment of the process variable with this line indi￾cates that the process is functioning within its statistical control limits.
3.6 Frequently Used Control Charts
Control charts are tools in QC that analysts use to monitor the performance of laboratory 
tests over time.
3.7 Types of Control Charts
3.7.1 Levey-Jennings Charts
Levey-Jennings (LJ) charts find application in laboratories for monitoring test accuracy and 
precision. They were developed by Dr Samuel Levey and Dr Ernest Jennings in the 1950s.
The main purpose of a Levey-Jennings chart is to track QC data for a test or analytical 
process. It helps identify errors or trends that could indicate issues with the test procedure 
or instrument used.
A typical Levey-Jennings chart consists of two axes and other elements listed in the 
following.26 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
• The X axis represents the time or sequence of QC measurements, which can span 
hours, days, or runs depending on the frequency of testing.
• The Y axis represents the QC values, or measurement results, for an analyte. These 
values are usually expressed in the same units as the test results.
• The central line represents the desired value for the QC material, typically calcu￾lated from a series of control measurements.
• Upper and lower control limits: These limits are established at a distance from the 
average, usually at +/– 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations (SDs) to define control zones.
• When utilising a Levey-Jennings chart, laboratory staff plot the QC data points on 
the chart and analyse them for any patterns that might indicate problems with the 
instrument or process.
3.8 Example of Levey-Jennings Control Chart on ICSI Degeneration
The ICSI degeneration rate refers to the percentage of eggs that deteriorate following the 
ICSI procedure.
Using a Levey-Jennings chart reveals if a process is statistically under control and identi￾fies systematic variations. In relation to the ICSI degeneration rate, it helps us detect any 
fluctuations over time. Higher rates of degeneration might suggest issues with the ICSI 
technique.
To create a Levey-Jennings chart, observations are plotted along with the value 
(represented by the central line) and control limits (upper and lower). These limits are 
typically set at distances of +/– 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the mean, as shown 
in Figure 3.1.
The collected data on ICSI degeneration rates is over a period of 10 months.
FIGURE 3.1
Example of Levey-Jennings control chart on ICSI degeneration rate.Quality Control Tools 27
The average degeneration rate is recorded at 14% with a deviation of 1.5%.
Based on this information, the control limits can be calculated as follows:
For +/– 1 deviation
Upper control limit = 15.5%, lower control limit = 12.5%;
For +/– 2 deviations, UCL = 17%, LCL =11%;
And for +/– 3 standard deviations, UCL =18.5%, LCL=9.5%.
Methodology for detecting anomalies: If a data point exhibits a deviation greater 
than 3 standard deviations from the control limits, it may suggest the presence of 
a systematic error. Conducting thorough investigations and implementing suit￾able remedial measures is of the utmost significance. Similarly, if two out of three 
consecutive data points deviate beyond 2 standard deviations from the control 
limits, it may indicate a potential trend that could result in the system going out of 
control. Additionally, if 80% of the data points deviate beyond 1 standard devia￾tion from the control limits, this may suggest the emergence of a discernible pat￾tern in the process.
To ensure reliable results in laboratory tests, Levey-Jennings charts are key tools. These 
charts plot individual test results against time and help monitor semen analysis, oocyte 
maturation, and embryo development.
Another useful tool for monitoring shifts over time is cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts. 
Unlike Shewhart charts, CUSUM charts can detect changes that may not be immediately 
apparent.
CUSUM charts work as follows:
• Calculate the sum by measuring deviations between the process measurements 
and a target value (the process mean or desired value).
• Plot the sum on a chart over time to track any shifts or trends.
To analyse the chart, one must search for any patterns or trends that suggest a change 
in the process. There are characteristics of CUSUM charts to consider, such as the 
following:
• Sum charts are highly sensitive and can detect even small shifts in the process.
• They are more effective at identifying changes in the process compared to 
Shewhart charts.
• However, interpreting charts may be more challenging, as they lack precise cen￾trelines and control limits.
Figure  3.2 provides an example of a CUSUM control chart used to monitor pregnancy 
rates. In this scenario, the target pregnancy rate is set at 40%, which means aiming for 
24 pregnancies out of 60 attempts per month. By plotting these deviations over time on a 
graph with months on the x axis and sum values on the y axis, it can show any significant 
upward or downward trends. Such trends might indicate a shift in the process and could 
require further investigation. See Figure 3.2.28 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
3.9 Shewhart Control Charts
Shewhart charts, developed by Walter A. Shewhart, are utilised to monitor the stability 
of a process and identify factor-related variations. They are also referred to as statistical 
process control (SPC) charts (Figure 3.3).
Shewhart charts function as described in the following.
• Gather data from the process and calculate the standard deviation.
• Establish control limits based on the process mean and deviation, usually set at 
+/– 3 deviations from the mean.
• Plot the data points on a chart with the process mean as the line and the control 
limits as the lower boundaries.
3.9.1 Key Characteristics of Shewhart Charts
• Designed to identify shifts in the process
• Easier to interpret compared to CUSUM charts, with defined centreline and con￾trol limits
• Less sensitive than CUSUM charts for detecting shifts in the process
Sum charts are ideal for detecting gradual changes in a process, while Shewhart charts 
are best suited for spotting sudden shifts. Depending on the specific needs of monitoring 
and controlling laboratory processes, either or both of these control charts can be selected. 
Particularly in ART labs, these charts are beneficial for monitoring various stages of the 
FIGURE 3.2
Example of a CUSUM control chart on pregnancy rate.Quality Control Tools 29
process. To illustrate, consider the example of monitoring the fertilisation rate. There are 
20 samples, each representing the success rate for one week. To establish a control chart for 
these values, the standard deviation must be calculated. Given that the average fertilisa￾tion rate (x¯) is 76.5 with a deviation (σ) of 2, the UCL and LCL can be determined. The UCL 
is calculated as x¯ + 3σ, which in this case would be 76.5 + 32 = 82.5.
Similarly, the LCL is obtained by subtracting 3σ from x¯: 76.5 – 32 = 70.5.
If any value falls outside these limits, it could suggest that the process is out of control.
Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) charts, which are statistical process 
control tools, are commonly used in labs and industries to monitor and identify shifts in 
processes. These charts are particularly effective when it is crucial to detect changes in 
the mean or variability of a process. Unlike SPC tools like Shewhart and CUSUM charts, 
EWMA charts assign decreasing weights to data points in an exponential manner, making 
data more sensitive to recent changes.
EWMA is a time series forecasting technique that relies on a moving average, giving 
importance to the most recent observations. This aspect makes it highly suitable for detect￾ing shifts in a process.
3.10 Explanation of EWMA
• Weighting factor (λ): The weighting factor (lambda) is a value between 0 and 1 
that determines how much emphasis is placed on a given data point compared to 
previous data points. A higher λ value means that recent data points carry weight, 
causing the EWMA chart to respond faster to process changes.
FIGURE 3.3
Example of Shewhart control chart for fertilisation rate.
Note: The UCL and LCL values remain the same across all weeks, as they are calculated from the overall 
mean and standard deviation of the process.30 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
• Calculation: The EWMA is calculated using the following formula: EWMAt
 = λ × 
xt
 + (1−λ) × EWMAt−1.
• λ is the weighting factor, a value between 0 and 1.
• xt
 represents the data point at time t.
EWMAt−1 is the EWMA value from the previous time point t−1. To create an EWMA 
chart, the EWMA values are plotted on the axis against time. Additionally, there is a line 
representing the process target and upper and lower control limits based on the desired 
confidence level and process variability. These limits help determine if the process is under 
control or not.
Interpretation of an EWMA chart involves observing whether the EWMA points remain 
within the control limits. If the points stay within these limits, it indicates that the process 
is under control. However, if points go beyond these limits or have random patterns, this 
suggests that further investigation is needed, as it may indicate an out-of-control process.
One advantage of using EWMA charts is their sensitivity to detecting shifts in the pro￾cess mean compared to statistical process control tools; this makes them useful for applica￾tions where identifying changes is crucial.
Data integration: EWMA charts utilise a moving average that considers both recent 
observations and past data. This method provides a representation of the process.
Customisation options: The sensitivity of the EWMA chart can be tailored to process 
requirements or desired responsiveness by adjusting the weighting factor, λ. Limitations 
of EWMA charts include the following points:
Large shifts may take longer to be detected with EWMA charts compared to SPC 
tools like CUSUM charts.
EWMA calculations are more complex than simple moving averages.
EWMA charts are useful for identifying shifts in laboratory processes.
The choice of control chart depends on the type of data being analysed and the specific 
goals of the laboratory.
3.11 Analysing the Control Chart
Examining trends involves collecting and organising data over a period of time and then 
representing this data on a graph. This helps to identify recurring patterns or shifts in the 
data.
Considering point-to-point fluctuations, which represent the variability in any process, 
significant deviations from data points may indicate a cause of variation that requires 
further investigation.
• Special cause variation: This kind of variation is not part of the process and can 
occur due to equipment malfunctions, mistakes made by operators, or changes in 
the raw materials.Quality Control Tools 31
• Run examination: Also referred to as trend analysis, this statistical technique 
helps identify patterns in data points that consistently go above or below the con￾trol limits over a period of time.
• A continuous deviation of data points either above or below control limits for a 
period suggests a shift or change in the process average, while a gradual alteration 
indicates a drift. Both scenarios require investigation.
• Cycles and recurring patterns: Keep an eye out for patterns in the data that may 
indicate a process. Recognising these patterns can help understand how the pro￾cess behaves and identify sources of variation.
• Control limits: Control limits are determined based on data from the laboratory 
and are used to monitor parameters such as temperature, pH, and humidity. When 
a control limit is violated, it signifies that the parameter being monitored is out of 
control and corrective action needs to be taken.
• Statistical analysis: This involves examining the data to determine if there have 
been any changes in the process.
• T-test: This test is used to compare the averages of two groups of data to deter￾mine if there is a difference. In an ART lab setting, the t-test is applied when 
comparing the number of oocytes obtained before and after implementing a pro￾tocol change.
• ANOVA: ANOVA (analysis of variance) is a method for comparing the averages of 
data groups. In an ART lab, an ANOVA is used to compare the number of oocytes 
retrieved from patients or across different days.
• Chi-square test: This method helps identify any relationship between two 
variables.
3.12 Quality Indicators
Key metrics to assess the performance and effectiveness of ART labs are quality indicators. 
These indicators provide insights into the laboratory’s operations and its quality control 
system. Important quality indicators include the following:
Turnaround time: This refers to the time that passes between receiving a sample at 
the laboratory and delivering the test results. It helps gauge how promptly the lab 
processes samples.
Analytical error rate: This tracks the number of errors that occur during testing. 
Such mistakes may arise from human oversights, equipment malfunctions, or 
issues with the materials and supplies used in the lab. A low frequency of errors 
suggests an effective quality control system, ensuring dependable test outcomes.
Customer satisfaction: In ART labs, customer satisfaction encompasses the posi￾tive feelings of clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders involved in the ART 
process. Satisfaction levels can be assessed through surveys, feedback forms, or 
direct communication channels. High customer satisfaction signifies that the lab 
meets users’ needs and expectations, while lower satisfaction may indicate areas 
for improvement.32 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
Embryo development rates: The rate at which embryos progress to the blastocyst 
stage is an indicator of quality in ART labs. Higher development rates suggest 
favourable culture conditions and successful fertilisation techniques, while lower 
rates may raise concerns about laboratory techniques or equipment issues.
By monitoring these quality indicators, ART labs can ensure that their performance aligns 
with industry standards while continuously striving for improvement.
Success rates: One important factor to consider when evaluating the quality of ART 
procedures is the rate at which clinical pregnancies are achieved. Monitoring and 
tracking these success rates allows laboratories to assess their performance and 
identify areas that require improvement, ultimately increasing the chances of 
pregnancy.
Evaluation through external quality assessment (EQA): Participating in EQA pro￾grammes and proficiency testing provides a measure of a laboratory’s perfor￾mance compared to other labs and industry standards. Consistently performing 
well in EQA reflects the effectiveness of the laboratory’s quality control system.
3.13 Kaizen in ART Labs
Achieving outcomes in ART labs necessitates processes that minimise errors and a commit￾ment to continuous improvement. Kaizen, a management philosophy from Japan, embod￾ies the notion of making changes that accumulate over time to bring about significant 
transformations. It focuses more on progress than sudden and radical transformations.
3.13.1 Principles of Kaizen
Employee empowerment: Kaizen promotes a culture where individuals at all levels 
are encouraged to contribute ideas for improvement. This fosters a sense of owner￾ship and engagement among lab personnel, creating an environment conducive to 
innovation and efficiency (Figure 3.4).
Standardisation of procedures: Implementing procedures ensures consistency and 
minimises errors. By establishing a framework, ART labs enable staff members to 
perform tasks accurately while enhancing quality control.
Continuous improvement: The core tenet of kaizen is the pursuit of improvement 
through vigilance and regular evaluation in ART labs. Changes are implemented 
to optimise processes and outcomes. This commitment ensures that labs stay at 
the forefront of advancements in technology.
Waste elimination: Kaizen strives to eliminate practices that hinder efficiency. By 
adhering to these principles, ART labs can achieve improvements in their pro￾cesses while maintaining standards for reproductive technology advancements. 
ART labs assess workflows, eliminate steps, and streamline processes to minimise 
unnecessary time and resource consumption. This optimisation aims to maxi￾mise productivity and cost effectiveness.Quality Control Tools 33
Training: Embracing the kaizen philosophy fosters a culture of learning. Regular 
training sessions empower lab personnel to enhance their skills and stay up to 
date with emerging technologies and techniques, cultivating a workforce capable 
of delivering top-notch care.
Incorporating the kaizen philosophy in ART labs drives improvement, resulting in 
improved processes, reduced errors, and enhanced outcomes.
3.14 Implementation of 6S Methodology in ART Laboratories
ART labs prioritise precision organisation and operational efficiency. One successful 
approach for enhancing these aspects is the implementation of the Japanese 6S system, 
which includes a component that focuses on safety.
3.14.1 Understanding the 6S Methodology
The 6S methodology is an approach to organising and standardising workplaces. It con￾sists of six components (Figure 3.5).
Step 1. Sort (Seiri): The process begins by separating items. In an ART laboratory set￾ting, this may involve removing equipment or supplies that are not regularly used 
but take up space.
FIGURE 3.4
Diagram of kaizen steps.34 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
Step 2. Set in Order (Seiton): This step requires organising the items in a way that 
makes them easily accessible and reduces the time spent searching for them. It 
helps improve efficiency by minimising the time wasted looking for required items.
Step 3. Shine (Seiso): Cleaning and maintaining the workspace on a regular basis is 
crucial. In ART laboratories, this involves taking care of laboratory equipment and 
keeping the area clean to minimise the risk of contamination.
Step 4. Standardise (Seiketsu): Standardising workflows and procedures ensures pre￾dictable execution of the three steps. Standard operating procedures play a role in 
this stage, as they provide instructions for various tasks in the ART lab.
Step 5. Sustain (Shitsuke): Sustaining improvements requires discipline and commit￾ment. Regular audits, reviews, and training sessions ensure that the practices of 6S 
become deeply ingrained in the laboratory’s culture.
Step 6. Safety (the sixth ‘S’): Safety is an important aspect to consider. Creating a safe 
work environment in ART laboratories involves managing hazards correctly, han￾dling and storing chemicals, and ensuring proper usage of laboratory equipment.
3.14.2 Benefits of 6S
• Improved efficiency: The workflow becomes more efficient through the sorting 
and organising of items. Laboratory personnel can easily locate the materials they 
require, minimising wasted time and avoiding disruptions to procedures.
• Enhanced safety: A well-maintained and orderly laboratory is inherently safer. 
By implementing safety measures, the risk of accidents and mishandling of sam￾ples can be reduced.
• Reduced errors: Standardising processes minimises the likelihood of errors since 
each step is clearly defined and consistently followed.
• Increased productivity: When the workspace is free from clutter, supplies are eas￾ily accessible. Moreover, safety protocols are in place, and lab staff can concentrate 
on their tasks without interruptions or delays.
• Improved morale: A clean and organised workspace positively affects the morale 
and motivation of laboratory personnel. It fosters a sense of pride in their work 
environment while contributing to job satisfaction.

Environmental Monitoring
Environmental monitoring plays a vital role in the dynamic and intricate world of ART 
laboratories, serving as the cornerstone for achieving successful outcomes for patients. 
These laboratories operate at the intersection of biology and technology, presenting a 
unique blend of complexities where even the slightest variations in environmental condi￾tions can significantly impact results.
At the core of an ART lab’s environmental monitoring mission lies the task of creating 
and maintaining ideal conditions for handling delicate biological materials like oocytes 
and embryos. It is a meticulous process akin to fine-tuning a complex instrument, 
aiming to orchestrate a harmonious symphony of successful conception and healthy 
gestation.
The lab diligently evaluates and regulates critical environmental parameters such as 
temperature, humidity, and air quality. Additionally, vigilance extends to the detection 
of unseen factors like particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and microbial 
contaminants. The objective goes beyond mere detection, involving identifying poten￾tial sources of contamination and taking swift, appropriate measures to counteract any 
risks.
Environmental monitoring goes hand in hand with real-time tracking, enabling quick 
identification of potential issues and immediate corrective actions to uphold the quality 
and safety of ART procedures. This unwavering attention aims to optimise the laboratory 
environment, thereby enhancing the likelihood of successful ART procedures and ulti￾mately contributing to the miracle of life.
Effectively navigating this nuanced terrain requires a deep understanding of the ART 
laboratory’s ecosystem, intricate knowledge of sophisticated equipment, keen observation 
skills, and an unwavering commitment to patient safety and well-being.
Monitoring equipment: The benefits of environmental monitoring in ART labs are 
numerous, and monitoring is essential to maintaining a stable and contamination￾free environment and safeguarding the viability and development of delicate cells 
(Figure 4.1).
Key benefits:
• Confirming optimal culture conditions: ART procedures require controlled condi￾tions to foster the best possible outcome.
• Maintaining integrity: Regular monitoring ensures that the lab remains free from 
external influences that could compromise the quality of the procedures.
• Early detection of potential issues: Environmental monitoring allows for the early 
detection of problems such as equipment malfunctions, fluctuations in tempera￾ture or humidity levels, or the presence of contaminants.
• Ensuring compliance with regulatory standards: ART labs are subject to strict 
regulatory standards to ensure patient safety and the quality of the procedures.Environmental Monitoring 37
4.1 Sources of Contamination in ART Labs
Airborne particles and the mishandling of materials are sources of contamination. To 
maintain a safe environment in ART labs, it is vital to implement measures such as control￾ling air quality, adhering to aseptic techniques, conducting regular cleaning, and monitor￾ing quality control (Figure 4.2).
4.1.1 Microbial Contamination
Microbial contamination in ART labs is a major concern, as it can directly affect the qual￾ity and success rate of infertility treatments. The presence of microorganisms in the lab is 
known as contamination, and these can originate from several sources, such as the air we 
breathe, water, various surfaces, and laboratory equipment. Interestingly, even lab person￾nel can inadvertently contribute to this problem, as they can bring these microorganisms 
into the lab through their clothing, skin, hair, and personal items like mobile phones.
The implications of such contamination are quite severe. Beyond simply compromising 
the quality of the gametes and embryos, it can also negatively affect the overall success 
rates of ART procedures, thereby diminishing the chances of conception. Additionally, the 
risk of infections increases significantly through contamination. It is therefore unsurpris￾ing that contaminations often lead to inaccurate lab results, hindering the efficiency of 
delicate laboratory procedures.
FIGURE 4.1
Factors influencing ART lab environment.38 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
FIGURE 4.2
Primary sources of contamination.
Smartphone contamination: In a revealing study conducted in municipal hospi￾tals of Chongqing, China, researchers investigated the extent of bacterial colonisation 
on the mobile phones and hands of healthcare workers (HCWs). Of the 111 mobile 
phones analysed, a staggering 95.5% were found to be contaminated with bacteria.
The most frequently detected strains included Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed 
by Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus. The research not only highlight￾ed the risks associated with contamination but also pinpointed the primary factors 
contributing to this pervasive issue. Notably, frequent phone usage was identified as 
a significant risk factor, with those using their phones more often exhibiting substan￾tially higher contamination rates—an association underscored by an odds ratio of 
8.366. Interestingly, the use of phone covers, which might seem protective, was linked 
to increased bacterial contamination.
This sheds light on the need for stringent measures to tackle the risk of cross￾contamination via contaminated smartphones. Institutions could consider imple￾menting guidelines that mandate healthcare workers clean their smartphones 
regularly, while individuals should also be encouraged to follow this practice for 
their safety (Yao et al., 2022).
Prevention of microbial contamination: To prevent contamination, it is important 
to follow laboratory practices. This includes wearing appropriate attire in the lab, 
regularly washing hands, and consistently cleaning and disinfecting laboratory 
equipment and surfaces.Environmental Monitoring 39
4.1.2 Chemical Contamination
Chemical contamination is another factor that can have an impact on ART procedures. 
Surprisingly, even disinfectants which are meant to keep the laboratory environment 
clean can be harmful to eggs and embryos, resulting in reduced viability and lower suc￾cess rates. Additionally, contamination can arise from plastics and other materials used 
in the lab, as they may introduce chemicals that adversely affect the outcomes of ART 
procedures.
Selecting lab disposables is important. This involves consideration of not just the prod￾ucts themselves but also how they are manufactured, and it ensures quality control mea￾sures during production. High-quality lab disposables are produced with stringent quality 
control procedures in place to ensure they meet all required industry standards.
4.1.3 Physical Contamination
There are various sources of contamination in ART labs; one such source is particles and 
debris that can come from dust, fibres, or other small particles in the air. These particles 
can settle on surfaces and can be transferred through contact with lab personnel, equip￾ment, or consumables. When this happens, they may contaminate the culture media, com￾promising the sterility of the laboratory environment. This contamination can also affect 
the viability of eggs, sperm, and embryos.
Contamination can also occur through laboratory equipment that is improperly cleaned 
or maintained. Pipettes, incubators, and workstations that are not properly taken care of 
can introduce contaminants into the lab environment. Additionally, broken glassware or 
damaged materials can also bring particles into the lab.
Furthermore, consumables used in ART labs can also contribute to contamination if 
they are non-sterile or expired. Culture media that is not properly maintained or expired 
pipette tips and Petri dishes pose a risk of introducing contaminants into the lab envi￾ronment. Regular maintenance and cleaning procedures for both laboratory facilities and 
equipment are crucial to mitigating this risk.
4.1.4 Personnel Contamination
Personnel themselves can unintentionally contaminate ART labs through their clothing 
items, skin flakes/hairs/respiratory secretions/fluids, and so on. Personnel contamina￾tion refers to the introduction of microorganisms, particles, or other contaminants into 
the laboratory environment by lab personnel. This compromises the conditions needed 
for various ART procedures to be successful. Personnel contamination can occur through 
various means, including the following:
Clothing: Lab coats, uniforms, or even regular street clothes can carry contaminants.
Skin and hair: Skin cells, hair strands, and sebaceous secretions may carry microor￾ganisms or particles that have the potential to contaminate the lab environment.
Respiratory secretions: Coughing, sneezing, or even talking can release droplets con￾taining microorganisms that may settle on surfaces or equipment in the lab.
Other bodily fluids: Touching one’s face, nose, or mouth transfers microorganisms to 
the hands and subsequently contaminates surfaces, equipment, or consumables 
in the lab.40 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
Personal items: Accessories like jewellery, watches, cell phones, pens, and other 
personal belongings can harbour contaminants and introduce them into the lab 
environment.
4.2 Prevention of Personnel Contamination
Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used as a safeguard for lab workers against 
threats such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The specific PPE required may vary 
depending on the procedures performed in each laboratory setting. However, common 
PPE items used in ART labs include gloves, lab coats, hairnets, and face masks.
4.2.1 Hand Hygiene
It is essential for laboratory personnel to thoroughly wash their hands with soap and 
water for a minimum of 20 seconds. Practising good hand hygiene is the best way to 
prevent the transmission of infections. Lab staff must diligently clean their hands using 
soap and water for 20 seconds before and after handling gametes or embryos, using 
the restroom, or dealing with any potentially contaminated materials. In situations 
where soap and water are not available, alcohol-based hand sanitisers can be used as 
an alternative.
4.2.2 Staff Training
It is of the utmost importance that all personnel working in laboratory settings undergo 
comprehensive training in various techniques; measures to prevent contamination; and 
proper protocols for handling materials, equipment, and consumables.
Limited access: To mitigate the potential for contamination, it is advisable to restrict 
the number of individuals authorised to enter the laboratory and to establish appropriate 
access control measures.
Appropriate laboratory attire: The implementation of regulations pertaining to attire, 
coupled with the prohibition of certain articles, can effectively contribute to the preserva￾tion of a hygienic environment.
Health monitoring: It is strongly advised that laboratory personnel promptly report 
any instances of illness or symptoms indicative of infection. Policies aimed at prohibiting 
employees from conducting work within the laboratory setting serve to enhance the over￾all quality of the working environment.
The maintenance of cleanliness and hygiene is of the utmost importance to ensuring 
a pristine laboratory environment. It is imperative to diligently clean and disinfect work 
surfaces, equipment, and communal areas to effectively eradicate any potential contami￾nants. These practices guarantee a hygienic laboratory setting.
4.3 Cross-Contamination
Cross-contamination in ART laboratories refers to the transfer of microorganisms or other 
contaminants from one procedure or sample to another. This occurs when materials or Environmental Monitoring 41
equipment used in one ART procedure are not adequately cleaned and disinfected before 
being used in another procedure.
4.3.1 Prevention of Cross-Personnel Contamination
Cleaning and disinfection: All equipment and materials used in ART procedures 
must undergo cleaning and disinfection based on established protocols before 
being used again.
Use of single-use consumables: It is recommended to use pipette tips, culture dishes, 
and gloves to minimise the risk of cross-contamination.
Segregation of work areas: Allocating workstations for ART procedures is crucial to 
preventing cross-contamination between them.
Workflow management: Following a defined workflow helps reduce the movement 
of materials, equipment, and personnel between work areas. This includes desig￾nated pathways for sample and material transport as well as assigning specific tasks 
to individual personnel, thereby decreasing the chances of cross-contamination.
Storage of materials and equipment: Storing materials and equipment in locations 
separate from workstations helps reduce the risk of contamination. These storage 
spaces are regularly maintained to ensure cleanliness and sterility.
Training: It is essential to provide training to laboratory staff on laboratory tech￾niques and protocols to effectively prevent cross-contamination.
4.4 Air Quality in ART Labs
Air quality refers to the presence or absence of particles, gases, and microorganisms in the 
atmosphere. Within ART laboratories, maintaining air quality is vital not only for the well￾being of lab personnel but also to create an ideal environment for embryo development 
while safeguarding against any potential contamination of the embryo culture medium 
(Figure 4.3).
FIGURE 4.3
Air quality contributing factors.42 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
4.4.1 Factors Affecting Air Quality in ART Labs
Personnel and patient activities: The activities carried out by laboratory personnel 
and patients can contribute significantly to air contamination.
Building location: The location of the building, its geographical surroundings, and 
various design elements all affect the air quality within ART labs. Elements such 
as the building envelope, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) sys￾tems, and ventilation rates play a role. Buildings situated near roads or industrial 
areas may experience levels of outdoor pollutants that can potentially penetrate 
the facility. Additionally, poorly designed HVAC systems may result in poor air 
circulation, leading to increased concentrations of contaminants in the surround￾ing environment.
Laboratory equipment and supplies: The type of equipment and supplies used 
within ART labs can also contribute to air contamination issues. Poorly maintained 
machinery may inadvertently release particulate matter into the atmosphere.
 Ensuring air quality within ART labs requires attention to these various factors 
to protect both laboratory personnel health as well as successful embryonic devel￾opment without any risk of contamination.
Cleaning and maintenance: The cleanliness and maintenance practices at ART labs 
can have an impact on the air quality. If cleaning is inadequate, dust and debris 
can accumulate, which in turn contribute to the presence of particulate matter in 
the air. Similarly, if HVAC systems are not properly maintained, dust and other 
pollutants can build up and circulate in the air, leading to poor air quality.
Chemicals: When disinfectants, solvents, or fixatives are used, there is a possibility of 
releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the surrounding environment.
Outdoor air quality: Outdoor pollutants have the potential to enter ART labs through 
ventilation systems or open windows connected to the air handling unit (AHU), 
thus contributing to a decline in air quality.
HVAC stands for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. In ART labs, 
HVAC systems are vital to maintaining optimal air quality and controlling the labo￾ratory environment’s temperature, humidity, and air circulation.
Air filters are incorporated into HVAC systems to eliminate particulate matter and 
other impurities from the air. ART labs frequently employ high-efficiency particulate 
air (HEPA) filters to effectively remove airborne particles that could potentially harm 
embryo quality. These filters have a minimum particle removal efficiency of 99.97% for 
particles larger than 0.3 microns and can filter out an array of airborne contaminants.
Another significant component of HVAC systems in ART labs is air circulation. Air 
circulation helps maintain a uniform distribution of air and temperature within the 
laboratory environment to maintain consistent conditions and facilitate the develop￾ment of embryos. Proper air circulation helps prevent the buildup of contaminants in 
the air, reducing the risk of contamination of the embryo culture medium.
The optimal air quality in ART labs is contingent upon the appropriate mainte￾nance and monitoring of HVAC systems.
The routine replacement of filters, periodic system inspections, and calibration of 
temperature and humidity sensors are needed to protect the performance of HVAC 
systems used in ART laboratories.Environmental Monitoring 43
Construction: Any construction or renovation activities happening within or near 
ART labs also play a role in diminishing air quality. These activities generate dust 
and other particulate matter that is released into the air and spreads throughout 
the laboratory.
The consequences of poor air quality within ART labs are significant. It can adversely 
impact embryonic development, reduce fertilisation rates, and increase the risk of fungus 
contamination. Moreover, it also poses health and safety risks for laboratory personnel 
and patients.
4.5 Parameters for Air Quality Monitoring
4.5.1 Temperature
In ART labs, the ideal ambient temperature ranges between 22 °C and 25 °C depending on 
lab requirements and the type of ART procedure being conducted.
To ensure temperature consistency, the strategic placement of temperature sensors 
allows for real-time monitoring; this enables responses to any fluctuations that may occur. 
In addition to controlling the temperature, it is crucial to maintain the incubators used for 
embryo culture at a temperature of 37.0 °C (+/– 0.2), mirroring the human body’s natural 
warmth. Temperature sensors positioned inside the incubators assist in monitoring and 
maintaining this environment.
The design and maintenance of HVAC systems, insulation of laboratory walls and doors, 
and the utilisation of incubators and workstations equipped with precise temperature con￾trol capabilities ensure the even distribution of temperatures throughout the laboratory 
setting.
Regularly replacing filters is necessary to prevent dust accumulation or other par￾ticulate matter that could disrupt temperature control. Additionally, it is essential for 
laboratory personnel to undergo training on protocols for regulating temperatures. To 
ensure temperature regulation in laboratory operations, it is important to establish and 
follow SOPs.
4.5.2 Humidity Control
Maintaining the levels of moisture in the air, also known as humidity control, is crucial 
for ART labs. The ideal humidity range should be between 40% and 60%. Fluctuations in 
humidity can negatively impact embryonic quality due to increased risk of contamination. 
It is essential to monitor and promptly respond to any changes in humidity levels to effec￾tively control and maintain the desired environment.
4.5.3 Air Pressure Control
The laboratory should be maintained at a higher pressure than the outside environment. 
This positive pressure helps prevent contaminants from entering the lab. Achieving 
air pressure control requires well-designed HVAC systems and regular maintenance. 
Automatic door closures and airlocks also play a role in maintaining this pressure 
difference.44 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
4.5.4 Particulate Matter
Elevated levels of particulate matter (PM) can have effects on embryonic development 
and pose risks to lab personnel’s health and safety. In ART labs, particle counters are used 
to detect and count particles based on their size. This measurement focuses on particles 
ranging from 0.3 to 5 microns. To effectively control particulate matter, it is important to 
design and maintain HVAC systems that properly utilise air filters and to follow labora￾tory procedures that minimise the generation of PM.
4.5.5 Monitoring Volatile Organic Compounds
In ART laboratories, monitoring VOCs is given high priority to ensure optimal air quality 
and to reduce potential risks associated with exposure to harmful chemicals. Acceptable 
limits for VOC levels in ART labs typically aim to be below 0.5 parts per million (ppm). 
However, these limits may vary depending on the chemicals being used. The regulations 
are set by local authorities.
Controlling VOCs involves using products that have VOC content, implementing ven￾tilation systems, and ensuring appropriate storage of chemicals. Specific areas within the 
lab are designated for chemical storage purposes only and are kept separate from labora￾tory spaces.
Portable photoionisation detectors (PIDs) are used in ART labs to analyse organic com￾pounds. These handheld instruments measure VOCs by ionising them in the air and mea￾suring the resulting electrical current. While a PID is a specific technique that can detect 
all types of VOCs, it is not as sensitive or specific as gas chromatography-mass spectrom￾etry (GC-MS).
4.6 Microbial Contaminant Monitoring
The acceptable limits for colony-forming units (CFUs) in ART labs typically aim for less 
than 500 CFUs per cubic metre of air for bacteria and 50 CFUs per cubic metre for fungi. 
However, these limits may vary based on the requirements of the ART lab and the type of 
procedure being performed.
4.7 Strategies for Maintaining Optimal Air Quality
4.7.1 Proper Laboratory Design
To minimise the entry of pollutants, it is beneficial to organise the layout of the laboratory 
in a way that limits the movement of both materials and personnel. It is recommended 
to divide the laboratory into sections dedicated to tasks such as oocyte retrieval, embryo 
culture, and cryopreservation. Including an airlock entrance in the laboratory design helps 
safeguard against contamination from nearby areas (see Chapter 16).Environmental Monitoring 45
4.8 Air Filtration Systems
Types of filters: In ART labs, two types of filters are used, prefilters and high-effi￾ciency particulate air filters. Pre-filters, usually made of polyester or fibreglass, 
effectively capture dust, pollen, and hair. On the other hand, HEPA filters are 
designed using fibres that create a sort of labyrinth for trapping particles as small 
as 0.3 microns (Figure 4.4).
Filter efficiency: The efficiency of filters is measured using the minimum efficiency 
reporting value (MERV) rating scale, which ranges from 1 to 20. A higher MERV 
rating indicates an effective filter. For HEPA filters in ART labs, it is recommended 
to choose a filter with a rating of 14 or higher. Filters with this rating can capture 
over 99.995% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, ensuring effective removal of 
airborne contaminants from the laboratory.
Air exchange rate: The air exchange rate is the number of times the air inside the 
laboratory is replaced with clean, filtered air per hour. A higher air exchange rate 
means that the air inside the lab is refreshed more frequently. ART labs’ recom￾mended air exchange rate is 15–20 air changes per hour to ensure that the air 
inside the lab is filtered and replaced frequently enough to maintain a clean 
environment.
Filtration system design: The air handling system should be balanced so that air 
flows from clean to dirty areas. The system’s design also considers the laboratory’s 
layout, procedures, and the number of people working in the lab.
4.9 Positive Air Pressure
Entry points: Ensuring consistent air pressure is essential to prevent outside air from 
infiltrating. In the laboratory, particular focus should be on potential entry points 
such as doors, windows, and vents.
Airlocks: Airlocks play a role in maintaining pressure and preventing contaminated 
air from escaping.
4.10 Regular Cleaning and Maintenance
To maintain a well-functioning laboratory, it is recommended to establish a cleaning 
schedule that includes tasks such as wiping down work surfaces and equipment with 
solutions. Monthly tasks should focus on maintaining and cleaning air ducts, filters, and 
exhaust fans.46 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
4.11 Cleaning Agents
When selecting cleaning agents for an ART lab, it is crucial to use formulations specifically 
designed for laboratory environments. These agents should not leave any residue or emit 
VOCs. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions when using cleaning agents, ensur￾ing they are used at the recommended concentration for effectiveness.
Maintenance of Equipment: It is important to perform maintenance tasks such as 
cleaning, replacing filters, calibrating equipment, and conducting inspections. 
Keeping a logbook to document these activities helps ensure that they are com￾pleted successfully and regularly.
4.12 Sterilisation Methods
Heat Sterilisation: In this heat sterilisation process, high temperatures are used to sterilise 
equipment, work surfaces, and laboratory areas. Autoclaving is the most commonly used 
heat sterilisation method, where steam under pressure reaches temperatures up to 121 °C.
Chemical Sterilisation: Chemicals like ethanol and glutaraldehyde are used in sterilisa￾tion to eliminate microorganisms. Unlike heat sterilisation, which requires high tempera￾tures, chemical sterilisation is performed at temperatures suitable for materials sensitive to 
heat. However, this method may require exposure periods for sterilisation and could leave 
residues on the materials that need additional rinsing.
Radiation Sterilisation: Gamma rays, UV light, or electron beams are employed in 
radiation sterilisation to kill microorganisms. This method is useful for materials that 
FIGURE 4.4
Photograph showing clean and contaminated laminar air flow prefilter.Environmental Monitoring 47
cannot tolerate temperatures or chemical treatments. Nevertheless, radiation sterilisation 
demands equipment and may incur higher costs compared to other methods.
4.13 Use of Low-VOC Materials and Chemicals
To ensure the safety of embryo development, it’s imperative for ART laboratories to use 
materials and chemicals that minimise the emissions of volatile organic compounds. This 
means choosing paints, adhesives, and flooring materials with low or no VOC emissions. 
Additionally, selecting cleaning agents and chemicals that have reduced VOC emissions is 
crucial to maintaining air quality and preventing respiratory irritants. However, it is impor￾tant to note that while using low-VOC materials and chemicals is necessary, proper ventilation 
and air exchange should not be overlooked. Adequate air exchange is essential for bringing 
in clean, filtered air and swiftly removing any contaminants. To uphold quality and safety 
standards in the laboratory, personnel must receive training on cleaning procedures, sterili￾sation processes, and equipment maintenance through SOPs. These protocols also address 
contamination control guidelines for handling materials and biological waste.
Reporting: It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to promptly report any 
incidents or deviations from protocols to their lab manager. Immediate reporting 
minimises the risk of negative consequences and allows for the implementation of 
appropriate measures.
4.14 Real-Time Monitoring Devices
Parameters: Real-time air quality monitoring devices measure factors such as tem￾perature, humidity, air pressure, particulate levels, carbon dioxide, and VOCs.
Sampling methods: Real-time air quality monitoring devices employ sampling tech￾niques including active or continuous methods.
Sensor technology: The accuracy and precision of measurements in real-time air 
quality monitoring devices are influenced by the sensor technology employed.
Real-time data and alerts: The data collected by the sensors is transmitted instantly 
to a monitoring system, where it is analysed and compared against limits. When 
a parameter exceeds its designated boundaries, it activates an alert. Relevant per￾sonnel are notified via email, text message, or an alarm system.
Calibration: To calibrate air quality monitoring devices, it is common practice to 
use certified calibration gases that contain known concentrations of pollutants. 
The sensors in the monitoring device are exposed to the calibration gas, and their 
readings are compared to the known gas concentration.
User interface: One effective approach is to present the data in a simple manner that 
is easy to understand. It is vital to give users access to both the data itself and 48 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
the ability to track trends over time. Furthermore, it is important for the interface 
to provide users with the ability to customise their thresholds and notification 
preferences.
4.15 Data Logging and Reporting
While local servers grant enhanced control over data storage, cloud-based systems offer 
advantages in terms of scalability and accessibility. Irrespective of the storage method 
selected, it remains imperative to encrypt data, ensuring protection against unauthorised 
access. Reporting plays a role in ensuring compliance with requirements and maintain￾ing transparency with stakeholders. Data needs to be reported to highlight parameters 
being monitored, conditions encountered, and any corrective actions taken. Reports can 
be generated either automatically or manually using software that leverages predefined 
templates and thresholds for automated reporting purposes.
For monitoring and control of parameters, it is essential to integrate continuous monitor￾ing systems with building management systems and HVAC systems. This integration is 
made possible through the use of protocols like Modbus or BACnet, which facilitate com￾munication between devices manufactured by companies.
4.16 Scheduled Assessments of Different Air Quality Parameters
Microbial air sampling is a technique used to identify and measure microorganisms 
in the air.
The settle plate method aids in detecting particles and microorganisms that settle 
onto agar plates. It is a cost-effective approach that provides insights into the 
types and quantities of microorganisms found in the air. However, it has its limi￾tations. For an accurate assessment of air quality, it’s important to take samples 
while accounting for factors like air currents, temperature, and humidity, as well 
as ensuring proper placement of settle plates. Adhering to the manufacturer’s 
guidelines for placing the settle plates is key to achieving reliable results. Active 
air sampling is a technique that involves using an air sampler to draw in air either 
through a filter or an agar plate. The collected sample is then incubated to identify 
and count the number of colony-forming units effectively detecting microorgan￾isms suspended in the air.
Impaction sampling is a method for detecting both larger and smaller particles as well as 
microorganisms. Various impaction samplers exist, each with its distinct advantages and 
disadvantages. In laboratories, the samplers used are Andersen, and reuter centrifugal sam￾pler (RCS). The Andersen sampler is a single-stage impactor designed to collect particles 
ranging from 0.3 to 10 micrometres in size. The RCS sampler is a stage impactor capable of 
collecting particles between 0.1 and 10 micrometres in size. The Reuter centrifugal sampler 
serves as a high-volume impactor that can collect particles sized from 0.1 to 100 micrometres.Environmental Monitoring 49
Choosing sampling locations: Sampling locations are chosen based on a risk assess￾ment of the laboratory environment, ensuring that the samples accurately repre￾sent the lab’s air quality. High-risk areas where procedures are performed and 
aerosol generation occurs are more likely to be included, as well as low-risk areas 
with no procedures.
Sampling frequency: The frequency at which air samples are taken depends on fac￾tors such as the types of ART procedures being conducted, the sensitivity of the 
laboratory, and any regulatory requirements in place. For example, laboratories 
involved in IVF may need to conduct air sampling every month.
Trend analysis: Analysing patterns and carefully evaluating data over time can 
determine if the current sampling frequency is adequate and can help to assess 
whether any adjustments are needed to ensure monitoring. To ensure control of 
counts and particle levels, it is crucial to establish specific thresholds or boundar￾ies. These limits should be determined based on guidelines or industry standards.
Particle counters: Particle counters are commonly employed to measure the levels 
and dispersion of particles in the atmosphere.
Calibration: To ensure accurate measurements, it is advisable to calibrate particle 
counters. Calibration can be accomplished through the use of calibration particles 
or other techniques for calibration purposes.
Sampling locations: Sampling locations are selected based on the likelihood of con￾tamination. High-risk areas refer to those where procedures are performed, while 
low-risk areas are those where no procedures take place.
Sampling frequency: The frequency at which we sample depends on the risks 
involved and compliance with requirements. Certain regulations mandate par￾ticle counting, while others require monitoring.
4.17 VOC Measurement Devices
Particle size range: In cleanrooms, particle counters should have the capabil￾ity to measure particles ranging from 0.5 to 5 microns. This size range is par￾ticularly important to maintaining the desired cleanliness levels in cleanroom 
environments.
Portable VOC measurement devices known as photoionisation detectors are utilised to 
detect and measure the concentration of compounds in the air. PIDs are designed to be 
lightweight, portable, and user friendly, making them highly suitable for on-site monitor￾ing and swift air quality screening in ART labs.
The functioning of PIDs involves generating high-energy ultraviolet light through a 
lamp, which then causes the ionisation of VOCs present in the air. This process leads to the 
creation of charged ions and free electrons. The charged ions are subsequently collected 
on a charged electrode, generating an electric current that is directly proportional to the 
concentration of VOCs in the air. This current is displayed on a screen, enabling real-time 
monitoring of VOC concentrations.50 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
4.18 Third-Party Evaluations and Certification
Third-party evaluations and certifications offer an impartial evaluation of the air quality 
within ART laboratories.
The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) has established air quality 
standards for ART labs. These standards, such as ISO 14644 and ISO 18562, focus on ensur￾ing cleanroom environments and assessing emissions from devices. When it comes to cer￾tification, the ISO certification process involves evaluating how a laboratory adheres to ISO 
standards. This evaluation includes reviewing documents, conducting on-site inspections, 
and testing air quality parameters.
The certification process typically consists of steps that a laboratory needs to follow.
1. Initial assessment: The laboratory undergoes an evaluation to identify any areas 
where it may not meet ISO standards. Based on this assessment, a plan is devel￾oped to achieve certification.
2. On-site evaluation: An independent auditor visits the laboratory to assess its envi￾ronment and determine compliance with ISO standards. During this visit, the 
auditor carefully reviews documentation related to air quality monitoring and 
corrective actions.
3. Corrective actions: If any noncompliance issues are identified during the evalua￾tion, the laboratory must create and implement a plan to effectively address these 
issues.
4. After implementing the action plan, a follow-up evaluation is conducted to ensure 
that all non-compliance issues have been effectively resolved.
5. Certification is granted to a laboratory that successfully meets all ISO requirements 
and standards. This certification serves as recognition of the lab’s dedication to 
delivering results while continuously improving its operations in accordance with 
established standards.
Complying with ISO standards entails meeting criteria related to monitoring air quality, 
maintaining documentation, and taking actions when necessary.
Maintaining records regarding air quality monitoring, corrective actions taken, and 
other relevant requirements is crucial for laboratories. To address any compliance issues 
identified during the certification process, it is essential to develop and implement mea￾sures for resolution.
Regular audits should be conducted to ensure compliance with ISO standards. 
Additionally, personnel should receive training updates and make adjustments to the lab￾oratory environment and procedures as needed.
4.19 Cleanroom Classifications and Standards
The ISO cleanroom standards encompass a collection of internationally recognised stan￾dards that establish specific criteria for cleanrooms, clean air devices, and the testing and 
monitoring of cleanroom environments.Environmental Monitoring 51
The two primary standards for cleanrooms are ISO 14644 and ISO 14698.
ISO 14644: ISO 14644 defines cleanroom classifications based on the maximum 
allowable concentration of airborne particles. The standard uses a logarithmic 
scale to quantify particle density, with each class defining a specific upper limit 
on the number of particles present per cubic metre of air.
The ISO cleanroom classification system ranges from Class 1 to Class 9, with Class 1 being 
the most stringent and Class 9 being the least stringent (Table 4.1).
ISO 14698 is a set of guidelines that focus on controlling biocontamination in cleanrooms.
Cleanroom classifications: Cleanrooms are categorised based on the concentra￾tion of airborne particles within them. The ISO cleanroom standards and the US 
Federal Standard 209E are two systems utilised for classifying cleanrooms.
4.20 US Federal Standard 209E
US Federal Standard 209E was formulated by the US federal government in 1963 as a 
comprehensive directive for cleanrooms. Cleanroom standards are established to pro￾vide guidance for the design, operation, and maintenance of cleanrooms. These standards 
are designed to ensure that the air quality, airflow, filtration, and overall functionality of 
cleanrooms meet the specified requirements.
The following are examples of cleanroom standards around the world.
ISO 14644: This internationally recognised standard establishes norms for clean￾room design, operation, and maintenance according to ISO cleanroom classifica￾tions. It covers aspects such as air cleanliness, pressure differentials, temperature, 
and humidity control to ensure that environments meet predetermined levels of 
cleanliness and sterility.
USP <797>: This standard, set by the United States Pharmacopoeia, focuses on com￾pounding guidelines. It includes requirements for cleanroom design, air quality 
management, personnel training, and monitoring. The goal is to prevent harm to 
patients by avoiding contamination (particulate) variations in compounded prep￾arations’ intended strength or using ingredients of inappropriate quality.
BS 5295: This is a British standard that defines cleanroom classification based on the 
number of particles per cubic meter at specific particle sizes.
EU GMP guidelines: These guidelines, which are mandated by the European Union, 
set out the standards for ensuring the cleanliness of manufacturing products. 
These guidelines include requirements for maintaining cleanroom environments 
in production.52 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
4.21 External Laboratory Assessments
External evaluations conducted by organisations such as the International Laboratory 
Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC), the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation 
(A2LA), and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) play a role in assessing labora￾tories. While these assessments are typically voluntary, certain regulatory agencies may 
require them as part of licencing or accreditation procedures.
During a laboratory assessment, experts in laboratory quality management and techni￾cal competence conduct on-site inspections to review aspects of the laboratory operations. 
This includes examining laboratory procedures, equipment, and personnel qualifications 
and conducting sample testing to evaluate performance. Based on their findings, the asses￾sors assign a score or rating that reflects how well the laboratory meets standards.
Completing an assessment can lead to accreditation or certification for laboratories, 
which serves as recognition of their competence and commitment to quality.
4.21.1 Benefits of External Laboratory Assessments
A significant advantage of laboratory assessments is their ability to evaluate the perfor￾mance of a laboratory in meeting established quality standards. The evaluation is con￾ducted by external assessors who possess specialised knowledge in laboratory quality 
management.
Furthermore, these assessments serve the purpose of identifying areas in which enhance￾ments can be implemented within the laboratory’s processes, procedures, and equipment. 
The provision of this valuable feedback enables laboratories to consistently improve their 
operations and ensures compliance with rigorous quality standards.
4.22 External Assessments in India
In India, there is an organisation called the Indian Society for Assisted Reproduction 
(ISAR) that grants accreditation to ART labs. ISAR is a group dedicated to promoting 
TABLE 4.1
The Maximum Allowable Particle Concentration for Each Class
Class Maximum Allowable Particle Concentration
Class 1 10 particles/m3 of size 0.1 µm or greater
Class 2 100 particles/m3 of size 0.1 µm or greater
Class 3 1,000 particles/m3 of size 0.1 µm or greater
Class 4 10,000 particles/m3 of size 0.1 µm or greater
Class 5 100,000 particles/m3 of size 0.1 µm or greater
Class 6 1,000,000 particles/m3 of size 0.1 µm or greater
Class 7 352,000 particles/m3 of size 0.5 µm or greater
Class 8 3,520,000 particles/m3 of size 0.5 µm or greater
Class 9 35,200,000 particles/m3 of size 0.5 µm or greaterEnvironmental Monitoring 53
research and education in the field of reproduction in India. To receive ISAR accredi￾tation, IVF labs undergo an evaluation of their facilities, equipment, procedures, and 
staff qualifications. The accreditation process includes on-site inspections and assess￾ments of the lab’s quality control measures and documentation. The lab’s performance 
is evaluated based on outcomes, laboratory procedures, quality control practices, and 
safety measures.
Aside from ISAR accreditation, ART labs in India also have the option to seek accredita￾tion from recognised organisations such as the Joint Commission International (JCI) or the 
ISO. These organisations set standards for quality healthcare and may be relevant for IVF 
labs involved in international research or that serve international clients.
Furthermore, there is another accrediting body called the National Accreditation 
Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH), which provides accreditation 
for ART clinics in India. The NABH accreditation programme follows guidelines that 
cover aspects of ART clinics. Similar to ISAR accreditation, this process involves physical 
inspections and reviews of quality control procedures and documentation at the clinic. 
NABH accreditation holds significance, as it represents excellence in assisted reproduc￾tion within India.
NABL, which stands for the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration 
Laboratories, oversees the accreditation process for testing and calibration laboratories 
in India. This organisation plays a role in maintaining India’s quality infrastructure by 
upholding technical expertise within these facilities.
4.23 Air Quality Control and Improvement
A practical approach to air quality management typically involves the execution of moni￾toring and testing protocols, preventive strategies, and remedial actions.
4.23.1 Monitoring and Testing
Specialised equipment is employed for testing the laboratory environment by measuring 
air quality levels. The frequency and extent of these tests are customised to suit the specific 
needs and treatments of each laboratory.
4.23.2 Preventive Measures
In addition to monitoring, a comprehensive plan for air quality management should 
include strategies to prevent potential contamination; this could involve implementing 
cleaning protocols for surfaces, equipment, and tools or utilising high-efficiency air filters 
that can effectively trap particles.
4.23.3 Corrective Actions
Despite taking preventive measures, there may still be instances where air quality issues 
arise. When this happens, it is essential to have an action plan ready; this might include 
improving ventilation systems using air purifiers or additional filters or temporarily sus￾pending treatments until the air quality problem has been fully resolved.54 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
4.24 Identifying and Addressing Sources of Contamination
Common sources of contamination can be chemicals, microorganisms, and particu￾late matter that originate from equipment, cleaning agents, or even lab personnel. To 
minimise these risks, it is vital to regulate usage in the lab environment, choose clean￾ing agents carefully, and provide thorough training to staff regarding proper cleaning 
procedures.
4.25 Advanced Air Purification Technologies
4.25.1 Ultra-Low Particulate Air Filters
Incorporating air purification technologies adds to existing strategies for managing air 
quality and helps to safeguard conditions within ART laboratories. One such technology 
is ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) filters, which are even more effective than HEPA filters 
in removing particles from the air. ULPA filters have the ability to eliminate up to 99.999% 
of particles measuring 0.12 microns or larger. They are commonly utilised in environ￾ments that demand a high level of air quality, such as cleanrooms.
4.25.2 Activated Carbon Filters
Another essential tool for purifying the air are activated carbon filters. These filters excel 
at removing VOCs and other gaseous pollutants from the surrounding atmosphere. By 
adsorbing pollutants onto activated carbon with its structure and high surface area, these 
filters effectively enhance air quality.
4.25.3 Photochemical Oxidation
Photochemical oxidation stands out as a technology that employs light and tita￾nium dioxide to break down organic pollutants present in the air. This technique 
significantly reduces levels of VOCs, contributing to cleaner and healthier indoor 
environments.
4.26 Maintaining Air Quality
4.26.1 Minimising Movement and Foot Traffic
To reduce the risk of contamination, it is important to minimise foot traffic and person￾nel movement within the lab. We recommend providing training to laboratory personnel 
on the significance of being mindful of their movements. Sudden movements can create 
turbulence, worsening the spread of contaminants. Establishing zones for both personnel 
and equipment movement is also recommended.Environmental Monitoring 55
4.26.2 Adhering to Protocols and Guidelines
Regularly reviewing and updating protocols based on scientific advancements and regula￾tory mandates is highly recommended.
4.26.3 Regular Cleaning and Disinfection
Maintaining air quality involves cleaning and disinfecting laboratory surfaces and 
equipment.
4.26.4 Proper Waste Management
It is vital to ensure the disposal of waste by using designated containers for different types 
of waste. Educating staff on waste disposal procedures is essential, including the use of 
sharps containers, biohazard bags, or other appropriate waste containers that comply with 
requirements.
4.27 Water Quality Management
pH: In ART labs and incubators, the pH of the water is closely monitored. Maintained 
within a specific range, this ensures that the environment for embryonic devel￾opment is optimal. The recommended pH range for incubator water is typically 
between 7.2 and 7.4; any deviations from this range can have effects on the pH of 
the culture medium, which in turn can lead to lower fertilisation rates and lower 
embryo quality.
Conductivity: Conductivity measures the ability of water to conduct electricity and 
serves as an indicator of water purity to prevent interference with embryonic 
development. For incubator water, it is generally recommended to maintain con￾ductivity levels below 3 microsiemens per centimetre (μS/cm). High conductivity 
can result in an accumulation of ions in the culture medium, which negatively 
affects embryonic development and viability.
Sterility: Maintaining sterility helps prevent contamination and also aids in avoid￾ing any potential chemical reactions or changes in pH that may be triggered by 
bacteria or other microorganisms.
Endotoxin levels: Endotoxins are lipopolysaccharides found in the membrane of 
gram-positive bacteria, and they can trigger inflammatory responses in embryos. 
Water used in incubators for purposes typically contains less than 0.25 endotoxin 
units (EU)/ml.
Trace elements: For embryo development, trace elements like copper, zinc, and man￾ganese are necessary. Available water already contains levels of these trace ele￾ments to ensure optimal embryo development.
Storage: When storing water for incubators, it is important to use containers and 
keep them at the right temperature while also keeping them away from potential 
sources of contamination.56 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
Shelf life: Using expired water negatively affects the water quality and has an impact 
on gametes and embryos.
4.28 Surface Monitoring and Control
Monitoring and controlling surface conditions are essential components of laboratory 
operations and management. The establishment of a controlled environment is of utmost 
importance to uphold the quality and viability of gametes and embryos.
4.29 Cleanroom Design
ART laboratories have been purposefully designed as cleanrooms to mitigate the potential 
hazards associated with contamination.
Positive pressure: The differential pressure mechanism ensures that any potential 
leaks or gaps will result in air flowing outward, effectively preventing the entry 
of contaminants. Cleanrooms utilise air handling units and air volume systems to 
regulate airflow and maintain pressure.
Airflow management: Laminar flow hoods ensure a flow of HEPA-filtered air over 
the workspace, creating a controlled airflow pattern that minimises turbulence 
and reducing the risk of cross-contamination between workstations. Additionally, 
air showers are utilised at entrance and exit points to remove particles from per￾sonnel and materials before they enter the cleanroom.
Proper room layout: A properly designed room layout aims to minimise the move￾ment of personnel and materials, thereby reducing the risk of contamination. 
Designing the layout involves placing workstations, equipment, and storage areas 
to optimise efficiency.
Surface materials: Countertops and work surfaces in cleanrooms often use steel 
due to its resistance to corrosion and ability to withstand cleaning agents. Non￾chemical-resistant and easy-to-clean surface materials are also considered for 
maintaining cleanliness. Tempered glass is a good choice for walls and windows, 
as it provides durability.
Temperature control and light: Cleanrooms require adequate lighting to facilitate 
work. Typically, LED lights are preferred as they generate minimal heat and are 
energy efficient.
Access control: In the context of access control, it is crucial to implement measures 
that limit and manage the ingress and egress points within controlled environ￾ments. This objective can be accomplished by utilising access systems such as key￾cards or biometric authentication methods.Environmental Monitoring 57
4.30 Cleaning and Disinfection Protocols
Maintaining a laboratory environment requires attention to cleaning and disinfection pro￾tocols. While specific guidelines may vary, it is important to follow certain advice.
To effectively disinfect surfaces, it is recommended to use either 70% ethanol or a quater￾nary ammonium compound. These substances target the microorganisms found in labo￾ratory settings.
After the disinfection process, it is essential to dry surfaces using paper towels. Proper 
disposal of these towels is crucial to preventing cross-contamination. It is best to avoid using 
towels or cloths, as they can harbour microorganisms and contribute to contamination.
To create a laboratory setting, it is advisable to schedule deep-cleaning sessions. 
Additionally, it is important for face masks to adequately cover both the nose and mouth 
areas. Masks must be replaced when they become saturated. As a precaution against hair 
shedding onto surfaces, wearing hairnets is strongly recommended since this can help 
prevent contamination.
4.31 Surface Monitoring Techniques
One way to identify contamination is through an inspection, which is a simple and cost￾effective technique. However, it is important to note that this method may not always 
detect chemical residues in tiny amounts that are invisible to the naked eye or present in 
low concentrations.
For a quantitative approach to detecting organic residues on surfaces, ATP biolumines￾cence can be used. This method is effective in identifying chemical residues as well and 
is more sensitive than visual inspection. However, ATP bioluminescence tends to be more 
expensive due to the need for equipment.
Another option is testing, which involves collecting samples from surfaces using swabs 
or contact plates and analysing them in a laboratory. In this way, we can determine if there 
are microorganisms present on the surfaces being tested. The results of these tests help us 
evaluate the cleanliness of the surfaces and assess the risk of contamination or infection.
4.32 Workstation Organisation and Workflow
To maintain a clean environment and reduce the risk of cross-contamination, it is recom￾mended to implement workflow patterns involving the movement of materials and equip￾ment from clean areas to dirty areas.
To minimise the chances of contamination, it is advisable to assign personnel and equip￾ment to specific areas. Avoiding movement between areas can help mitigate the possibility 
of cross-contamination. It is important to sanitise both personnel and equipment after 58 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
their use when transitioning between different zones. Transparent surface monitoring and 
control protocols should be established, with all staff members encouraged to follow them. 
Periodic audits should also be conducted to assess the effectiveness of surface monitoring 
and control practices.

Equipment Maintenance:
Types of Equipment Used in ART Labs
ART labs employ a variety of equipment to aid in the handling, manipulation, and storage 
of gametes and embryos. It is critical to ensure that these instruments are properly main￾tained and calibrated for the operation of an ART lab.
5.1 Equipment for Andrology
Centrifuges play a role in andrology laboratories, as they assist in the separation of sperm 
from plasma and other cellular debris. There are two techniques used for this process: 
density gradient centrifugation and the swim-up method. Each technique offers distinct 
advantages depending on the desired outcome.
Rotor inspection and maintenance: Regular inspection of centrifuge rotors detects 
any signs of cracks, corrosion, or imbalance. This step is crucial, as damaged rotors 
can result in failures during operations. The manufacturer’s guidelines should be 
followed to clean and lubricate rotors and moving parts to extend their lifespan 
and ensure functionality.
Temperature control system: Temperature plays a role in sperm processing, as it 
directly impacts sperm viability and motility. Periodically testing the temperature 
control system of the centrifuge according to the manufacturer’s recommenda￾tions can confirm correct functioning. If any inconsistencies or issues arise, they 
must be addressed promptly to maintain operating conditions.
Speed calibration and general maintenance: Accurate speed settings are essential 
for obtaining consistent results when separating sperm.
It is important to adjust the speed settings of the centrifuge using a tachometer or other 
recommended tools for calibration purposes.
5.2 Computer-Assisted Sperm Analysis Systems
Computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) systems rely on computer algorithms to pro￾vide unbiased results when evaluating sperm motility and morphology. These systems 
generate data on sperm parameters, allowing for accurate comparisons between samples 
and tracking changes over time. CASA systems also have the advantage of analysing sam￾ples, enabling high throughput capabilities.60 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
In research settings and clinical trials, it is crucial to establish standardisation protocols 
across laboratories to ensure that results are comparable across institutions. Additionally, 
CASA systems often incorporate software that simplifies data storage and retrieval, 
streamlines record-keeping procedures, and enhances data management effectiveness. 
This contributes to maintaining quality control standards.
To ensure performance, it is essential to calibrate the system using samples with known 
properties that confirm measurement precision. Regular cleaning and maintenance of the 
microscope, stage, and camera according to the manufacturer’s recommendations are also 
necessary.
Periodic validation of CASA system performance involves comparing its findings with 
periodic evaluations as a benchmark.
5.2.1 Software Updates
To optimise the performance of the CASA system, it’s advisable to upgrade its software 
with the newest algorithms, enhancing its capabilities.
Emerging tools for semen analysis: AI-based semen analysis tools employ sophis￾ticated image processing and artificial intelligence to assess semen samples with 
increased accuracy. These tools capture high-definition images of the samples, 
and AI algorithms subsequently analyse them for sperm count, morphology, and 
motility. Additionally, the system can evaluate advanced parameters, such as path 
velocity and DNA fragmentation levels. The findings are aggregated into com￾prehensive reports for fertility experts. The primary benefits of these instruments 
encompass improved accuracy, efficiency, and the capability to offer an in-depth 
analysis, diminishing the human error and subjectivity present in traditional 
methods. Nevertheless, appropriate validation and calibration are vital for ensur￾ing peak performance.
5.3 Embryology Equipment
5.3.1 Laminar Flow Hoods
Laminar flow hoods are used in a controlled and sterile environment for purposes such as 
preparing culture media and working with gametes and embryos. Their main objective is 
to protect these samples from contamination by utilising HEPA filters.
5.3.2 Vertical Laminar Flow Hoods
Vertical laminar flow hoods operate by directing a stream of air onto a work area; this 
creates a controlled environment that minimises impurities, making it suitable for han￾dling samples. The hood’s intake system consists of a prefilter that efficiently removes 
particles, followed by a HEPA filter that eliminates bacteria and viruses. The purified air 
is then channelled downward into the area, creating a germ-free environment. The rate 
at which the air flows in this system is carefully controlled to prevent any disturbance 
that could lead to contamination while still effectively removing any particles from the 
work surface.Equipment Maintenance 61
Horizontal laminar flow hoods are designed specifically to protect samples from con￾tamination. They achieve this by directing the airflow across the designated work surface. 
This design effectively prevents contaminants from entering, ensuring the integrity of the 
samples.
To maintain effectiveness in eliminating contaminants, it is necessary to replace prefil￾ters and HEPA filters. The frequency of replacement may vary depending on filter type 
and usage.
Regularly measuring the airflow rate within the hood is crucial to ensuring it 
falls within given limits. An anemometer can be used as a method for achieving 
this goal.
Performance qualifications (PQs) are recommended to verify that the system functions 
properly. PQ testing assesses whether the hood maintains desired airflow rates, particle 
counts, and sterility levels.
5.3.3 Incubators
Incubators are essential in ART labs, as they play a role in IVF procedures and other ART 
techniques.
The following are the main types of incubators commonly used in IVF labs:
CO2 incubators: These are the incubators used in IVF labs. They create an environ￾ment by regulating the temperature, usually set at 37 °C (body temperature), and 
maintaining a carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, typically around 5%–6%. This 
CO2 concentration is crucial for maintaining the pH level of the culture medium, 
which is essential for embryonic development.
Tri-gas incubators: Tri-gas incubators are create an atmosphere with reduced oxygen 
levels, which is beneficial for the growth of embryos. Temperature and CO2 concen￾tration control in gas incubators are similar to those in CO2 incubators. The desired 
oxygen concentration is achieved by injecting nitrogen gas into the chamber.
Time-lapse incubators: Time-lapse incubators have built-in camera imaging 
capabilities that allow monitoring and recording of embryonic development. 
This feature ensures observation of embryos throughout the developmental 
process.
Gas sensor calibration: Regularly calibrating the CO2 and oxygen sensors using a cali￾brated gas mixture is a maintenance task that ensures that accurate and consistent mea￾surements can be obtained by making reliable readings.
5.3.4 Microscopes
Stereomicroscopes, also known as dissecting microscopes, offer a three-dimensional view 
of samples. They have magnification capabilities typically ranging from 10× to 50×. These 
microscopes are especially useful for observing oocytes and embryos.
Inverted microscopes have an inverted path compared to upright microscopes. This 
means that the objective lens is positioned beneath the specimen stage, while the 
light source and eyepiece are located above it. This design allows for observation of 
cells and tissues in culture dishes during embryo assessment and micromanipulation 
procedures.62 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
Phase contrast microscopy is a technique that enhances the visibility of specimens that 
may be difficult to see using bright field microscopy. By altering the phase of light passing 
through the specimen, this method improves visualisation.
Fluorescence microscopes utilise fluorescent markers attached to target molecules, 
which emit a glow when exposed to wavelengths of light. These microscopes are com￾monly used in ART labs for testing, research purposes, and imaging markers or structures 
within oocytes and embryos.
Compound microscopes are widely used in medicine and science fields. They offer ver￾satility and are often favoured due to their ability to provide high-quality images across 
applications.
To obtain a magnified view of the sample, a sequence of lenses is used that results in an 
image. Compound microscopes are capable of observing specimens ranging from cells to 
bacteria to organisms.
5.3.5 Maintenance and Calibration
Cleaning the optics: The optical components of a microscope include lenses, mir￾rors, and other parts that aid in specimen viewing. It is important to keep these 
components clean and free from debris or smudges, as this directly affects 
image quality. A  lint cloth or lens tissue along with a cleaning solution spe￾cifically designed for microscope optics should be used, while alcohol or harsh 
chemicals that could potentially damage the lens coatings should be avoided. 
The lenses should be handled delicately, without touching them with fingers or 
any other objects.
The illumination system of a microscope provides light for observing the specimen. The 
light source must be correctly positioned and adjusted to achieve the necessary brightness 
for imaging purposes. The mechanical elements of a microscope consist of the stage focus 
knobs and additional components that allow for movement and adjustment of the speci￾men. Regular inspections of these components are essential to ensure their operation and 
prevent any resistance. The stage must be level and stable, and the focus knobs must move 
smoothly without slipping or becoming stuck.
Calibrating the microscope: Calibration involves ensuring that the microscope pro￾duces measurements and images by adjusting the focus, aligning the optics, and 
verifying the magnification settings for accuracy.
5.3.6 Micromanipulation Systems
Micromanipulation systems are devices designed to precisely control and manipulate 
microtools. They enable procedures like intracytoplasmic sperm injection assisted hatch￾ing and embryo biopsy. These systems typically consist of three-axis control mechanisms 
(X, Y, and Z) that allow movements in all directions.
There are two types of micromanipulators.
Mechanical micromanipulators: These devices utilise gears, screws, and levers to 
achieve motion control. They often incorporate a fine-pitch screw that moves the 
tool a certain distance per rotation, such as 0.5 micrometres.Equipment Maintenance 63
Hydraulic or pneumatic micromanipulators: These devices use oil or air pressure 
to regulate the motion of microtools. Manual valve controls aid in pressure adjust￾ment, resulting in improved movement stability and smoothness. These systems 
employ closed-loop feedback control to maintain positioning and to counteract 
drift (Figure 5.1).
5.3.7 Microtools
Microinjectors: These tools typically feature a glass pipette with a tip. The diameter 
of the tip can range from 0.5 to 10 micrometres, depending on its intended pur￾pose. This microinjector is connected to a pressure control system, which utilises 
either positive or negative pressure to regulate the flow of sperm during injection.
Microholders: These tools often employ vacuum pressure to securely hold cells, 
oocytes, or embryos in place. A  vacuum pump generates the pressure, and its 
strength can be adjusted to prevent any harm to the oocyte or embryo.
Micropipettes: Similarly, micropipettes are crafted from glass pipettes that are hollow 
inside. They may feature tips that are bevelled for cell aspiration or biopsy purposes.
Calibration of micromanipulators: To ensure measurements, calibration is per￾formed using a reference scale or stage micrometre with known dimensions. The 
micromanipulator is moved along the scale, and the distance travelled is com￾pared against the expected distance based on the device’s specifications.
Replacement of silicon sleeves: Some micromanipulators utilise silicon sleeves to 
create a surface and minimise contamination risks. It is important to replace these 
sleeves, as they may wear out over time.
FIGURE 5.1
Photograph of micromanipulation tubing with blockage.64 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
Maintenance of microinjectors: It is recommended to inspect the glass pipette of 
microinjectors for any signs of cracks or damage. Additionally, checking for clog￾ging or debris that may impede the flow of injected substances at the tip is essen￾tial. Proper maintenance and cleaning of the pressure control system play a role in 
ensuring its operation (Figure 5.2).
5.3.8 Supporting Equipment
Microscopes: Inverted microscopes are commonly used for micromanipulation pur￾poses, allowing for the visualisation of cells, oocytes, or embryos from below. To 
improve contrast and resolution compared to bright field microscopy, imaging 
techniques such as differential interference contrast (DIC) or Hoffman modula￾tion contrast (HMC) are often employed.
Anti-vibration tables: These tables are designed to minimise vibrations using meth￾ods like mass, damping, and isolation techniques. They typically feature a top 
supported by air-filled bladders or mechanical springs that effectively absorb and 
dissipate vibrations originating from the surrounding environment.
Heating stages: Heating stages utilise Peltier elements to maintain a constant tem￾perature during micromanipulation procedures. The temperature is accurately 
measured using either a thermocouple or a resistance temperature detector (RTD). 
A closed-loop feedback mechanism is then employed to regulate the temperature.
Software and computer systems: Micromanipulation systems come with software 
that offers real-time image processing capabilities along with automated data log￾ging and statistical analysis. Depending on the complexity and purpose of the 
system, the software may provide complete automation of the micromanipulators’ 
control. In systems, the integration of machine learning algorithms and computer 
vision methods can be utilised for tasks such as cell tracking, pattern identifica￾tion, and decision-making during micromanipulation procedures.
5.3.9 Laser Systems
In ART labs, laser systems are utilised for procedures like assisted hatching and embryo 
biopsy. Assisted hatching involves using a laser to thin the zona pellucida, facilitating 
hatching and subsequent implantation.
FIGURE 5.2
Photograph showing service error on the micromanipulator.Equipment Maintenance 65
There are two types of laser systems: Nd:YAG and diode lasers.
Operation: Neodymium doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers utilise a 
solid-state gain medium, a crystal infused with neodymium ions. The crystal is 
activated by either a flashlamp or diode laser to excite the neodymium ions into 
energy states. As these ions return to their energy state, they emit photons that 
stimulate the emission of photons, resulting in the creation of a coherent laser 
beam.
Wavelength: Nd:YAG lasers emit light at 1064 nm, falling within the infrared region 
of the spectrum. This wavelength’s ability to be readily absorbed by water and its 
localised heating capabilities make it highly suitable for hatching procedures.
Pulse duration and energy: To create an opening in the zona pellucida, Nd:YAG 
lasers employ pulses of high-energy light typically ranging in the nanosecond 
scale (9–10 seconds).
The size and depth of the hole created during embryo biopsy can be controlled by adjust￾ing the energy per pulse while also minimising harm to the embryo.
In contrast, diode lasers operate by generating a laser beam through indium gal￾lium arsenide materials. By applying a current to these semiconductor materials, pho￾tons are created that create a coherent laser beam that can be used for embryo biopsy 
procedures.
Diode lasers typically operate at near-infrared wavelengths between 650 and 980 nm; 
this allows for controlled ablation of cells during biopsy while minimising damage to sur￾rounding tissue.
When performing embryo biopsy procedures, it is common for lasers to have shorter 
pulse durations compared to Nd:YAG lasers. These pulse durations typically range from 
microseconds (6–10 seconds) to milliseconds (3–10 seconds), thus allowing for a controlled 
and gradual removal of cells. Additionally, the energy per pulse produced by lasers is 
lower than that of Nd:YAG lasers, reducing the risk of harm to the embryo.
They are generally smaller, lighter, and more affordable than Nd:YAG lasers, making 
them a favourable choice for IVF labs with budget limitations.
Diode lasers also offer flexibility in terms of wavelength emission, and they can be 
customised to emit wavelengths for different applications or to minimise damage to sur￾rounding tissue.
5.3.10 Maintenance and Calibration
To ensure performance, regular maintenance and calibration are essential. It is important 
to inspect the laser system’s lenses and mirrors for any dust, dirt, or damage. Cleaning 
should be done using a cloth or swab specifically designed for surfaces, along with an 
appropriate solvent formulated for such purposes.
Accurate alignment of the components plays a role in achieving the precise focus of the 
laser beam and ensuring optimal energy delivery to the intended target area.
The calibration process involves quantifying the energy or power of the laser beam 
using equipment like a laser power metre. Additionally, it entails adjusting the settings or 
components of the laser system to ensure that the measured energy or power falls within 
desired ranges. The goal is to align these measurements with established standards or 
reference values.66 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
5.4 Cryopreservation Equipment
5.4.1 Understanding Liquid Nitrogen
One notable property of LN2 is its boiling point of -196 °C (320 °F), because of which it is 
one of the substances most commonly employed in industrial and laboratory environ￾ments. This quality makes it particularly suitable for cryopreservation purposes.
Another interesting attribute is its expansion ratio. When LN2 evaporates, it rapidly 
expands, with a volume expansion ratio of 1:694 (meaning that 1 litre of nitrogen produces 
roughly 694 litres of gaseous nitrogen). While this rapid expansion can be advantageous 
for applications, it requires management, as it can lead to pressure buildup in closed con￾tainers and can displace oxygen in confined spaces.
LN2 does not readily react to other substances. This characteristic makes it an ideal choice 
in situations where chemical reactions need to be avoided. Another important aspect of 
LN2 is that it is not flammable and does not support combustion. That said, while it is non￾toxic, it can cause burns and frostbite upon contact with the skin or eyes due to its freezing 
temperature. A further advantage of LN2 is its viscosity, which enables it to flow more rap￾idly compared to many other liquids. This property makes it convenient for transfer and 
manipulation within laboratory environments.
Liquid nitrogen also exhibits a high latent heat of vaporisation, meaning that when it 
transitions from a liquid to a gas state, it absorbs some heat energy. This characteristic ren￾ders it suitable as a coolant. Furthermore, nitrogen, which constitutes around 78% of the 
Earth’s atmosphere, ensures the abundance and affordability of this resource.
5.4.2 Use of Liquid Nitrogen
The uses of LN2 are incredibly versatile. It has applications in various sectors due to its 
unique characteristics, including its temperature, non-reactive properties, and significant 
expansion ratio.
One important use of LN2 is cryopreservation, which is vital in research settings and 
which involves preserving sperm, eggs, embryos, tissues, and cells. LN2 plays a role in pro￾cedures such as fertility treatments, stem cell studies, and conservation efforts for species.
In the field, liquid nitrogen is employed for cryosurgery to remove warts, skin tags, and 
certain types of skin cancer. The freezing temperature of LN2 effectively destroys tissue 
while minimising damage to surrounding tissue.
Moreover, LN2 serves as a coolant in the electronics industry during semiconductor and 
circuit manufacturing processes. By maintaining temperatures throughout production 
stages, LN2 enhances efficiency and safeguards against damage.
Overall LN2’s adaptability makes it indispensable across industries. It finds application 
in the preservation of samples and materials through methods for long-term storage. The 
automotive and aerospace industries utilise LN2 to test the performance and durability 
of materials and components at different temperatures. Moreover, for metalworking and 
welding purposes, LN2 is utilised to shrink metal parts for assembly or disassembly. It also 
aids in cooling metals during machining processes, thereby reducing stress and distor￾tion. Additionally, specific welding techniques benefit from LN2 by minimising oxidation 
and improving weld quality.
In the chemical industry, LN2 is employed to cool materials before grinding them into 
powders. This process prevents heat-sensitive substances from degrading while facilitating Equipment Maintenance 67
a grinding process. In rocket propulsion systems, LN2 is occasionally used as a coolant for 
engine components. Its purpose is to maintain temperatures for proper engine function￾ing. Cryogenic storage tanks require the selection of insulation materials and temperature 
monitoring mechanisms.
5.4.3 Key Design Features of Cryostorage Tanks
Insulation: Cryostorage tanks use vacuum-insulated panels (VIPs) or perlite to 
minimise heat transfer and maintain low temperatures and therefore to preserve 
reproductive material.
Temperature monitoring: Manufacturers often incorporate temperature monitoring 
systems to ensure consistent temperatures. These systems include temperature 
sensors, thermocouples, or resistance temperature detectors. Connected to data 
loggers and alarm systems, these sensors help track and record temperature read￾ings over time. The collected data is then analysed for monitoring purposes, while 
the alarm systems provide alerts if the temperature deviates from the desired 
range.
Cooling method: The choice of cooling method is crucial when designing cryos￾torage tanks. Each cooling method has its advantages and disadvantages, which 
depend on factors such as storage capacity, lab space, and safety considerations.
Safety features: To prevent accidents and protect stored samples, cryostorage tanks 
are equipped with pressure relief valves, emergency shutoff valves, and oxygen 
monitors.
When designing cryostorage tanks, it is crucial to consider the design of the neck, which 
plays a role in minimising heat transfer and ensuring that ultra-low temperatures are 
maintained within the tank. The neck serves as the entrance and exit point for samples, 
allowing for insertion and retrieval.
Narrow diameter: To decrease heat transfer, the neck of a cryostorage tank is typi￾cally designed to have a narrow diameter; this reduces the surface area available 
for heat exchange.
Insulation: Insulation is also essential to achieving temperature control. Multiple 
layers of Mylar coated with either silver or aluminium are used to provide insu￾lation. Additionally, incorporating vacuum-insulated walls in the neck area can 
further enhance insulation capabilities.
Tapered design: Some cryostorage tanks feature a neck design where the diameter 
gradually narrows towards the top. This design helps minimise the exposure of 
stored samples to air when the tank is opened, resulting in less heat entering the 
system.
Neck plug: When not in use, a removable neck plug or stopper is often employed 
to seal off the opening of the cryostorage tank. This plug fits securely within the 
tank neck, creating a barrier against exchange and maintaining extremely low 
temperatures.
Neck design and sample accessibility: The way the neck is designed and how 
easy it is to access samples stored in the cryostorage tank are interconnected. It 
is important to find a balance between minimising heat transfer and ensuring 68 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
that samples can be easily inserted and retrieved when designing a plug that fits 
snugly within the neck. This can be achieved by using tools like canes or goblets 
and selecting a neck diameter that allows for access while also reducing heat entry 
into the system.
Maintenance: To maintain the desired temperature, it is crucial to check the nitrogen 
levels and refill as necessary. Additionally, the tanks must be inspected for any 
signs of damage or leaks, with prompt repairing or replacement when needed.
Cryovials: Cryovials are containers designed for storing samples at low tempera￾tures. They are typically made from materials like polypropylene, a polycarbon￾ate that can withstand cold conditions. Cryo-boxes are used to organise cryovials 
within the LN2 storage tanks.
Maintenance: Cryovials should be regularly inspected for any indications of 
cracks, leaks, or compromised seals to prevent sample loss or contamination. 
Any damaged cryovials must be promptly replaced, and the cryo-boxes should 
be kept clean and well organised, with clear labelling for sample identification 
and retrieval.
Cryo-markers: For labelling cryovials and other equipment used in cryopreserva￾tion, specialised pens called cryo-markers are utilised. These markers are spe￾cially designed with ink that can withstand the temperatures of cryogenic storage 
as well as exposure to ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. Cryo-markers are created to 
endure low temperatures while still being readable. Using cryo-markers to label 
cryovials helps identify the content of each vial while ensuring the integrity of the 
samples.
Safety equipment: When dealing with materials at high temperatures during 
cryopreservation processes, it is recommended that individuals operating cryo￾preservation equipment wear cryogenic gloves, face shields, and aprons for their 
safety.
Maintenance: Safety equipment should be regularly inspected for any signs of wear 
or damage and replaced as necessary. Personnel should be properly trained on 
how to use and care for safety equipment to minimise the risks associated with 
handling materials.
Laboratory consumables: ART labs make use of pipettes, petri dishes, and other 
items. The quality of these consumables is crucial for the success of ART 
procedures.
Disposable pipettes: In ART labs, disposable pipettes are commonly used to handle 
and transfer embryos, gametes, and culture media. These pipettes are meant for 
one use only and should then be discarded.
Storage: Pipettes should be stored in their packaging in a clean and dry area away 
from direct sunlight or heat sources. It is crucial to check the packaging for any 
damage before using the pipette.
Petri dishes: These dishes are used for cultivating embryos and preparing culture 
media and other compounds. They are typically made of materials such as poly￾styrene or glass and come in various shapes and sizes (e.g., four wells, centre 
wells). For storage, it is recommended to keep them in their packaging in a clean 
and dry area.Equipment Maintenance 69
5.4.4 Maintenance
Inventory management and the management of laboratory supplies are essential to main￾taining their integrity. It is important to monitor inventory levels and pay attention to 
expiration dates to ensure the quality of stored products.
5.5 Equipment Logs
In ART laboratories, maintaining accurate equipment logs and implementing quality con￾trol measures are crucial for performance. Equipment logs help track equipment usage, 
maintenance, and calibration, while quality control measures aid in identifying and 
resolving issues.
By monitoring how this specialised equipment is utilised and its performance, lab per￾sonnel can detect problems and address them before they impact the results. Regulatory 
agencies may also request the maintenance of logs for equipment to demonstrate adher￾ence to quality standards and guidelines.
For instance, if a lab uses laser systems for hatching or biopsy, they would keep a laser 
log to record the date, time, and relevant parameters for each laser use. Similarly, labs 
utilising micromanipulators for ICSI would maintain a micromanipulator log to document 
the date, time, type of needle used, and any observed issues during the procedure.
An incubator’s comprehensive record should diligently note each temperature and CO2
measurement checkup along with dates and times. It must also record any adjustments 
made to ensure embryo growth conditions as well as any irregularities detected during 
the incubation period.
The frequency of recording in specialised equipment logs may vary depending on the 
equipment used and procedures performed. To ensure the accuracy and completeness of 
the log, it is advisable to record any use of equipment in real time or immediately after 
the procedure. Laser systems or other equipment that is frequently used may require log 
entries, and it is crucial to keep them up to date for quality assurance and safety purposes.
When it comes to calibration and maintenance records, a standard calibration log should 
include details such as the calibration date, employed technique, and outcomes of the cali￾bration process.
If any incidents or deviations occur while using the equipment, it is important to docu￾ment them in the equipment log. For instance, if an alarm goes off on an incubator or LN2
tank, it should be noted along with the actions taken to resolve the issue.
5.5.1 Importance of Equipment Logs
Many ART labs now rely on electronic equipment logs, which offer efficiency and lower 
chances of errors compared to paper logs. These electronic logs can be integrated with 
laboratory information management systems (LIMS) and provide real-time data on equip￾ment performance and maintenance. Moreover, electronic logs provide automated alerts 
for calibrations or maintenance deadlines for added convenience.
The purpose of equipment logs is to ensure compliance by documenting performance 
and maintenance activities and to address any concerns regarding accuracy. During 70 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
inspections, these logs play a role in demonstrating compliance and showcase a commit￾ment to quality control. It is essential to maintain logs to track equipment during this 
procedure. These records provide information about the equipment’s performance and 
maintenance, enabling lab staff to identify and address any issues that could affect lab 
results. Neglecting the maintenance of these records can have consequences such as loss 
of certification, penalties, and potential legal liability if a patient suffers harm or injury.
5.6 Preventive Maintenance Schedule
A preventive maintenance schedule (PMS) is a plan that outlines maintenance tasks per￾formed on laboratory equipment to prevent breakdowns or malfunctions. An effective 
PMS plays a role in minimising breakdowns, optimising equipment performance, and 
ensuring compliance with standards.
Maintenance frequency: The frequency of maintenance activities depends on the 
type and usage of the equipment. For example, an incubator’s PMS may include 
assessments of temperature and CO2 levels, quarterly calibration, and the annual 
replacement of HEPA filters. Similarly, a microscope’s PMS may involve cleaning 
and inspection of lenses and mechanical parts, quarterly calibration of magnifica￾tion settings, and annual bulb replacement.
Documentation: It is essential to document all maintenance activities in the PMS. 
This documentation should include the date of maintenance, details about the 
type of maintenance performed, and any relevant notes regarding the condition of 
the equipment. Keeping a record like this helps track equipment performance over 
time, identify issues, and demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements.
Integration with equipment logs: The PMS should be integrated with equipment 
logs to create a record of equipment performance and maintenance history. 
Equipment logs can capture any observed issues or abnormalities during mainte￾nance activities.
5.6.1 Benefits of PMS
Enhanced safety: Checks and maintenance as part of a PMS significantly reduce the 
risk of accidents or hazardous situations. Engaging in this practice therefore plays 
a role in creating a safer working environment for laboratory personnel. Adhering 
to regulations and standards is an aspect of a PMS that supports ART labs. By fol￾lowing this approach, labs can ensure compliance with guidelines set by bodies 
like the FDA, WHO, or local authorities, thereby avoiding potential legal issues 
and penalties.
Moreover, adopting a maintenance routine significantly extends the lifespan of equipment 
by keeping it in optimal condition; this does not eliminate the need for premature replace￾ment expenses but allows laboratories to maximise their investment.
In ART labs, where accuracy is paramount, regular maintenance of equipment is crucial. 
It actively contributes to upholding data accuracy by minimising the occurrence of results 
caused by equipment malfunctions.Equipment Maintenance 71
Implementing a planned maintenance schedule brings benefits as well, enabling labo￾ratories to make estimations regarding future costs while effectively budgeting for neces￾sary maintenance and repairs. By adhering to a PMS, ART labs can act proactively and 
address equipment issues before they lead to downtime. This ensures that operations run 
smoothly without interruptions.
Having a maintenance system in place offers peace of mind to both staff members and 
management alike. They can rest assured knowing that the lab’s equipment is diligently 
maintained and less prone to failure. Ultimately, implementing these practices leads to 
peak efficiency within ART labs by maintaining standards and safeguarding valuable 
resources.
Keeping equipment in good condition through maintenance is crucial, as it not only 
saves time during experiments and procedures but also improves productivity and 
reduces energy costs.
When it comes to customer satisfaction, equipment maintenance and calibration plays a 
significant role. It helps with fertilisation, embryo development, and cryopreservation, all 
of which ultimately contribute to treatment outcomes.
5.7 Model Log
In the laboratory, each piece of equipment should be distinctly identified by its model, 
serial number, and location. Every usage should be logged, noting the date, time, and user. 
Daily maintenance tasks, such as cleaning and calibration, must be detailed with respec￾tive dates and the person responsible. When malfunctions occur, all repairs or modifi￾cations should be documented, highlighting the date, individual in charge, and results. 
Calibration records ought to include dates, methods used, outcomes, and any necessary 
adjustments (Tables 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3).

Quality Control of ART Media and Disposables
In ART laboratories, a range of culture media is commonly utilised because of their high￾quality, consistent properties and user friendliness. These media offer the essential nutri￾ents and ideal environments for the in vitro growth and evolution of embryos. Typically, 
these media consist of amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients 
required for embryonic growth. Additionally, they may also contain growth factors and 
hormones to support stages of embryonic development. The design objective is to mimic 
the environment found in the fallopian tube so that embryos can thrive and develop out￾side the human body.
6.1 Media for Handling Gametes
Human tubal fluid (HTF): HTF is formulated to replicate the environment found 
in the tubes. It is isotonic and buffered with N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-
ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) or bicarbonate to maintain pH levels. HTF contains 
glucose, pyruvate, amino acids, and albumin—all components that support gam￾ete survival and functioning.
Sperm washing media: Sperm washing media is specifically designed to separate 
motile sperm from plasma, debris, and non-motile sperm. These media contain 
components that help preserve sperm viability and motility, such as HEPES buffer.
6.2 Oocyte Maturation
In vitro maturation (IVM) media: For the oocyte to function optimally, it requires 
calcium, magnesium, and zinc, as well as specific amino acids such as L-glutamine 
and L-alanine. FSH and LH play a role in resuming meiosis and breaking down 
the vesicle, while epidermal growth factor (EGF) supports the expansion of cumu￾lus cells, which is crucial for oocyte maturation. These media may also include 
cysteine and glutathione to provide protection against stress.
Single-step media: Monophasic media, also known as single-step media, are cre￾ated with a balance of nutrients, growth factors, and hormones to facilitate embry￾onic growth from fertilisation until blastocyst formation without requiring any 
changes in the media used. The continuous culture method incorporates elements 
that serve as energy sources, such as non-essential amino acids, glucose, pyruvate, 
and lactate. Growth factors like EGF and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF β) Quality Control of ART Media and Disposables 75
as well as hormones like insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) are included 
to support growth. Collectively, these components create an environment that 
facilitates development.
Sequential media: Sequential media formulations are specifically designed for 
stages of embryo development.
Usually, in the initial three days of embryo culture, the media might include amino acids 
and glucose. But from days 4 to 6, the media might also have these elements in higher con￾centrations, complemented by growth factors. This assists the transition from the cleavage 
phase to the blastocyst stage.
For fertilisation, specific media are used that are supplemented with calcium, potas￾sium, and sodium ions. These ions help maintain balance and support sperm capacitation. 
The media also include bicarbonate and HEPES buffers for pH control. Albumin plays a 
role in removing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and providing fatty acids. Additionally, 
hyaluronan supports sperm motility and stability.
During the cleavage stage, specialised media are used that contain L-arginine, L-lysine, 
and L-glutamine. These components aid in protein synthesis and embryo development. 
The media also provide glucose, pyruvate, vitamins, and minerals for functioning. 
Regarding blastocyst culture, specific media are employed that have a proportion of non￾essential amino acids. This is necessary to support increased protein synthesis during 
this phase. Additionally, these media can be enriched with growth factors such as EGF or 
TGF β to promote inner cell mass (ICM) and trophoblast progression.
6.3 Micromanipulation Media
G MOPS (Gentle MOPS): It contains MOPS (3 [N morpholino] propane acid), a buf￾fer that maintains the pH of the medium within a range. G MOPS is designed 
for short-term use during procedures like oocyte retrieval, denudation, and ICSI. 
However, it is not suitable for long-term culturing or the incubation of embryos.
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP): PVP is a substance that helps regulate sperm motility 
during ICSI. It acts as a neutral polymer that attaches to the sperm membrane, 
preventing capacitation and increasing the chances of fertilisation.
Hyaluronidase: Hyaluronidase is an enzyme; it is naturally present in the oophorus, 
which forms a layer around the oocyte. In ART, hyaluronidase is commonly used 
to remove this layer by dissolving its hyaluronic acid structure. This process frees 
the oocyte from surrounding cumulus cells. This particular step plays a role in 
evaluating the maturity of the oocyte and preparing it for procedures such as ICSI.
Freezing media: Vitrification is a method of freezing that involves different con￾centrations of cryoprotectants and ultra-rapid cooling rates, typically achieved 
through liquid nitrogen. The vitrification solution contains levels (up to 40%) of 
ethylene glycol, DMSO, and sucrose, which protect the cells from ice crystal for￾mation during the cooling process.
Thawing media: Thawing solutions safely bring cryopreserved cells to room tem￾perature for use in ART procedures. Thawing solutions usually contain high 76 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
concentrations of cryoprotectants that restore the cell’s natural environment, bal￾ance pressure, and prevent cellular damage during thawing.
6.4 Storage of IVF Media
It is critical to store IVF media within an optimal temperature range to ensure their stabil￾ity and effectiveness, with most culture media typically requiring a range between 2–8 °C. 
Furthermore, protection from light exposure is equally important; hence, many containers 
used for ART lab media are designed to be opaque or are treated with coatings that block 
out light (Figure 6.1).
Shelf life: IVF media have a shelf life, meaning they can only be stored for a certain 
period before they expire. The actual shelf life may vary depending on the com￾position and manufacturer.
FIGURE 6.1
Photograph showing IVF medium in a frozen state.Quality Control of ART Media and Disposables 77
6.5 Types of Quality Control Tests for IVF Media
Quality control plays a role in ensuring the viability of embryos or gametes when using 
IVF media. As part of quality control measures, multiple tests are carried out to ensure 
that embryos, oocytes, and spermatozoa used in ART procedures are free from any 
contamination that could potentially pose risks.
Sterility testing: There are multiple methods for sterility testing, such as direct inoc￾ulation, membrane filtration, and the most probable number (MPN) method.
• In the inoculation technique, a small amount of the sample is added to a 
medium.
• Membrane filtration involves passing a known volume of the media or reagent 
through a filter with defined size. This filter retains any microorganisms in the 
sample. The retained membrane is then transferred to a medium.
• The MPN method includes diluting the media or reagent and introducing it 
into a medium. The number of negative test results is then used to calculate the 
probable number of microorganisms present.
Endotoxin testing: Endotoxins are substances composed of lipopolysaccharides 
found in the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria. A  common method for per￾forming this testing is by using the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. This 
approach utilises a reagent derived from the horseshoe crab. The reagent contains 
an enzyme that reacts uniquely with endotoxins resulting in the formation of a 
gel. The more gel that forms, the greater the concentration of endotoxins in the 
tested sample.
pH testing: The pH level of IVF media should be maintained between 7.2 and 7.4 to 
ensure embryos’ growth and development; this can be measured using either a 
pH metre or pH indicator strips that assess the hydrogen ion concentration in the 
sample.
Osmolality testing: An osmometer is used to measure the solute concentration in 
the sample. The utilised method for measuring osmolality involves freezing point 
depression, which determines the decrease in freezing point caused by solute 
presence.
Performance testing: During these tests, we culture embryos in the media and 
carefully observe their growth and development. Our goal is to ensure that 
the media effectively support the embryos growth and development, resulting 
in high-quality embryos that can be safely transferred or preserved through 
cryopreservation.
Stability testing: To assess the stability of our media and reagents, we subject them 
to temperature and humidity level tests. This helps us determine how well they 
resist varying conditions. During stability testing, we store the media for a period 
of time, then evaluate their quality through control tests to ensure performance 
and reliability, guaranteeing that they continue to meet their intended use and 
specifications over time.78 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
6.6 Overseeing the QC of an Open IVF Media Pack
Opened media packs in an IVF laboratory require more attention compared to sealed ones 
due to the increased risk of exposure to potential contaminants. Since the entire pack may 
not be used immediately, it becomes necessary to store it. However, this storage introduces 
risks such as air exposure, light intrusion, temperature fluctuations, and potential con￾tamination. These factors can have an impact on the quality and consistency of the IVF 
media. Therefore, it is extremely important to follow manufacturer guidelines and SOPs 
for handling and storing these opened packs from a quality control perspective. The fol￾lowing steps must be followed.
• Attach a label indicating the date and time of opening to keep track of the pack’s 
usage.
• Store packs of IVF media in a controlled environment, maintaining a temperature 
of 2–8 °C and a humidity of 50%–70%. Regularly monitor temperature and humid￾ity levels, discarding any media that have been contaminated or that have expired.
• Close IVF media packs when not in use to prevent evaporation. Contamination 
can introduce bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms that may affect embryonic 
development. Store the pack in a dry place for preservation.
• Adhere to the manufacturer’s instructions when determining the recommended 
duration for using packs of IVF media. After this designated period has passed, it 
is necessary to dispose the bottle.
• It is advisable to check the pH and osmolality of open-pack media as part of qual￾ity control measures. Detecting any changes promptly will help maintain quality 
and effectiveness while avoiding negative effects on patients.
• Using a laminar flow hood and following media preparation techniques can help 
prevent contamination.
• To avoid cross-contamination, it is important not to use packs of media simul￾taneously. It is recommended that each pack be used for a procedure, and all 
equipment should be carefully cleaned and sterilised after each use to minimise 
hazards.
• Before using any media, make sure to check the expiration date and discard any 
expired ones.
QC documentation: This documentation should include details such as the name of 
the media, batch number, manufacturing date, ingredients used, manufacturing 
procedure followed, test results obtained, and expiration date. This information 
helps identify and address any issues with the media before it is used.
• Quality control documentation plays a role in enhancing the quality of media, 
minimising the risk of contamination, increasing lab efficiency, and ensuring 
compliance with standards.
The following points offer examples of how quality control documentation is utilised to 
enhance the safety and effectiveness of ART lab media.Quality Control of ART Media and Disposables 79
• Documenting test results helps verify that the media meets all required standards.
• Keeping track of expiration dates prevents the use of expired media, which could 
pose risks to patients’ well-being.
• Certificates of analysis (CoAs) provide a summary of testing results for each batch 
of media to confirm its adherence to specifications. CoAs typically cover aspects 
such as sterility, endotoxin levels, pH balance, osmolality, and mouse embryo 
assay (MEA) outcomes.
• Product specifications offer a breakdown of the composition and characteristics of 
the media. This includes information about component concentrations, pH levels, 
osmolality, ionic strength, storage requirements, and shelf life.
• Bacterial endotoxin tests are typically carried out using the LAL test, with results 
that must be below the specified limit (0.25 EU/mL).
• MEA testing is widely applied during preparation to ascertain the media’s efficacy 
in supporting embryo development. The MEA acts as a benchmark to ensure the 
quality of both the media and the materials used in ART.
• Stability testing conducted under controlled storage conditions provides informa￾tion about the shelf life of the media. Expiration dates and appropriate storage 
conditions (e.g., 28 °C, protected from light) are clearly indicated.
• Traceability records involve assigning a lot number to each batch of media. These 
records help to quickly identify any batches for removal from use in cases of 
contamination or performance issues. By tracking the lot numbers used in each 
procedure, embryologists can monitor how well the media performs over time, 
identify patterns in outcomes, and make protocol adjustments.
To ensure the handling, storage, and testing of these materials, it is crucial to follow the 
recommended protocols and manufacturer instructions and maintain thorough docu￾mentation. This diligent approach plays a role in preserving the effectiveness and viability 
of these resources for patients undergoing fertility treatments.
CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY
• Appropriate quality control measures are mandatory to ensure the efficacy 
and safety of the used media.
• Testing IVF media involves sterility, endotoxin levels, pH, osmolality, and 
visual inspection. It ensures that the media are safe and effective for IVF pro￾cedures, ultimately enhancing the chances of successful implantation and 
pregnancy.
• The purpose of conducting these tests is to verify the absence of any poten￾tial contaminants, confirm all required chemical properties, and establish 
the safety of the media for use in ART procedures.80 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
• Maintaining the integrity of IVF media requires adherence to appropriate 
storage conditions.
• Regular monitoring of storage conditions is required to ensure the viability 
of the media.
• IVF media is a complex mixture of nutrients and other substances essen￾tial for embryo growth and development. Once opened, the media begins to 
degrade, and its effectiveness declines over time. Therefore, it is vital to use 
IVF media within the recommended timeframe and to discard any unused 
media.
• The recommended timeframe for IVF media varies depending on the spe￾cific media and the manufacturer’s instructions.
• QC testing for IVF media must be well documented to provide responsibility 
and traceability.
• Records of quality control tests must contain the date, test results, and the 
name of the technician who carried out the test.
• This document thoroughly outlines the media’s composition, providing spe￾cifics on the concentrations of all components, the pH value, osmolality, and 
ionic strength.
• Adhering to stringent quality control standards for IVF media and dispos￾able materials is crucial to ensure a reliable and secure setting for assisted 
reproduction. Compliance with these standards ensures they meet require￾ments and specifications, thus mitigating potential risks and maximising the 
success of the procedures.DOI: 10.1201/9781032622736-7 81

IVF Process and QC
In the health field, it is crucial for laboratories specialising in fertility assessments to obtain 
reliable results. Having a grasp of the IVF process enables ART laboratory staff to imple￾ment quality control measures at every stage of the procedure. It is essential to have an 
understanding of each step, from stimulation to embryo transfer, as they require specific 
conditions and meticulous handling. Furthermore, embryologists play a role in establish￾ing and monitoring quality control procedures to maintain standards in their lab practices 
(Figure 7.1).
7.1 QC in Andrology
7.1.1 Overview of Standard Andrology Lab Procedures
7.1.1.1 Semen Analysis
Semen analysis is a step in assessing male fertility. This evaluation involves measuring 
parameters such as volume, sperm count, motility, morphology, and the presence of cells 
like leukocytes. Low sperm counts and poor motility are often linked to infertility. Sperm 
motility refers to the ability of sperm to move forward effectively. Additionally, abnormal 
structure or shape of the sperm can hinder ability to fertilise an egg.
7.2 QC in CASA
Automated systems for sperm analysis utilise imaging technologies and computer vision 
algorithms to quantitatively analyse sperm samples. These sophisticated systems effi￾ciently examine thousands of sperm cells, providing data on factors such as sperm count, 
motility, morphology, and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, laboratories that utilise auto￾mated sperm analysis setups must adhere to calibration, maintenance, and proficiency 
examination protocols to ensure the accuracy of the results.
7.3 Standard Semen Preparation Techniques
Swim-up technique: The swim-up technique is commonly chosen as the method for 
selecting motile sperm for ART. This approach operates on the principle that ener￾getically swimming sperm move from the plasma into a culture medium.82 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
FIGURE 7.1
Schematic overview of the IVF process.
Density gradient centrifugation: In this method, the semen sample is layered on top 
of a two-tiered gradient and then centrifuged. The motile and morphologically 
normal sperm migrate through the gradient and accumulate at the bottom of the 
tube, while non-motile sperm, debris, and other cells remain in the layers.
Microfluidic devices: Microfluidic devices are an addition to the array of techniques 
used for sperm preparation. These methods contribute to enhancing understand￾ing of fertility by enabling assessments in ART laboratories.IVF Process and QC 83
These devices utilise channels and compartments to separate active sperm from inactive 
sperm and unwanted particles via motion and size. Microfluidic devices typically operate 
with small amounts of semen and have the ability to produce a highly refined sample of 
sperm.
Sperm freezing and thawing: Sperm freezing is especially beneficial for patients 
who may need treatment cycles or who are at risk due to treatments that can affect 
fertility. Thawing refers to the process of warming the sperm to make them viable 
again for use in IVF. To ensure quality control, proper labelling and storage of 
samples, monitoring temperature changes during thawing, and evaluating thaw￾ing motility and viability are important steps.
Assessing sperm DNA fragmentation: Elevated levels of DNA fragmentation can 
hinder conception. The sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) is a method used 
to examine DNA integrity. It involves using Acridine Orange, a dye that distin￾guishes between sperm with intact DNA and those with damaged DNA. Another 
technique used to evaluate sperm DNA integrity is the TUNEL (terminal deoxy￾nucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling) assay. This method detects frag￾mented DNA by incorporating labelled nucleotides at the break sites.
The comet assay, or single-cell gel electrophoresis, is also employed to assess sperm DNA 
fragmentation levels. In this process, cells are placed in a gel on a microscope slide and 
exposed to electrophoresis, which employs a field to separate molecules. When DNA is 
damaged, it migrates further in the gel, creating a comet ‘tail’ that gives the assay its name. 
The length and intensity of this tail indicate the extent of DNA damage. Understanding 
levels of sperm DNA fragmentation helps clinicians customise treatment plans for indi￾viduals based on their needs.
7.4 Surgical Sperm Aspiration
In cases of azoospermia, techniques like testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and micro￾surgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA) are useful, as they allow retrieval of sperm 
from the epididymis.
7.5 Quality Control
• Quality control plays a role in andrology laboratories, as it ensures accuracy, repro￾ducibility, and reliability in procedures while prioritising safety and effectiveness.
• To maintain accurate outcomes in andrology procedures, it is crucial to establish 
SOPs and adhere to them.
• Regular equipment maintenance and calibration are important aspects. Calibration 
involves using reference materials with known properties to check measurements. 
It is necessary to maintain calibration certificates or records for each instrument 
that document the calibration date, reference standards used, and obtained results.84 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
• Method validation and verification are steps that ensure the reliability and cred￾ibility of procedures in andrology labs.
• Andrology validation is a process that ensures the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, 
specificity, and robustness of a test method before it is implemented. It involves 
assessing analytical performance characteristics, establishing reference ranges, 
and evaluating any limitations. Verification is carried out when introducing a 
method or making changes to an existing one. It ensures that the method func￾tions as intended within the laboratory setting and confirms its reliability for 
diagnostic purposes.
• Quality assurance and quality improvement programmes play a role in main￾taining standards. Internal quality control enables laboratories to monitor their 
performance by using control materials to identify any errors or inconsistencies. 
External quality assessment programmes provide an evaluation of laboratory 
performance by comparing results with reference values and other participating 
laboratories.
• Documentation and record-keeping are important aspects of andrology proce￾dures. Thorough documentation supports traceability, simplifies troubleshooting 
processes, and acts as a resource during audits to ensure compliance.
7.6 Troubleshooting
Sperm preparation issues: Troubleshooting issues may arise during sperm prepara￾tion. Problems could occur during swim-up or during density gradient processes 
for sperm samples. In some cases, adjusting the protocol or modifying parameters 
like duration speed can potentially improve outcomes.
If there are problems, it might be worth exploring alternative methods of sperm prepara￾tion (Figure 7.2).
Challenges in procedures for retrieving sperm: Procedures like TESE can some￾times encounter difficulties in obtaining a suitable amount of sperm.
7.7 Solution
Making adjustments to the approach or utilising tools and microsurgical techniques could 
potentially improve the success rate of sperm retrieval.
When exploring retrieval techniques, if initial attempts are unsuccessful, it may be ben￾eficial to consider methods like microdissection TESE (micro TESE) or percutaneous epi￾didymal sperm aspiration (PESA).
Exploring options: Offering support and guidance to patients regarding alternative 
fertility options such as donor sperm or adoption can be crucial in cases where 
retrieval is not possible.IVF Process and QC 85
Equipment issues: Regular maintenance and a comprehensive schedule for upkeep 
of laboratory equipment, coupled with consistent calibration and quality control 
measures, ensure optimal performance and reliable and precise results while 
promptly addressing malfunctioning equipment through timely repairs or 
replacements and guarantee seamless operation in the andrology laboratory.
Human errors: Incorrect specimen labelling or procedural inaccuracies can occur in 
andrology laboratories. Occasionally, procedural errors may happen in andrology 
laboratories.
7.8 Troubleshooting of Human Error
Human error can be avoided through a combination of training and ongoing education for 
laboratory staff to improve their skills and understanding of procedures. Regular quality 
control inspections should also be conducted to identify any errors and allow for correc￾tions to adhere to established protocols and best practices.
FIGURE 7.2

By addressing troubleshooting scenarios in andrology procedures, professionals can 
successfully overcome challenges, thereby guaranteeing the provision of precise and 
dependable results.

Quality Control in Embryo Culture
It is important to ensure that the process of culturing embryos is done well to achieve 
successful outcomes in ART. Embryo culturing goes through quality control procedures 
that involve technological methods and strict protocols. These measures are in place to 
promote embryo development. The most viable embryos are then selected for transfer. 
Quality control in embryo culture can be broadly categorised into two interconnected 
components: laboratory quality control and embryo quality control.
8.1 Embryo Culture Conditions
The conditions of culturing embryos in a lab setting are crucial for their growth. To cre￾ate the environment, a formulated medium is used that contains a combination of salts, 
glucose, amino acids, and essential nutrients. It is important to control the pH level of the 
medium to ensure embryo development. Incubators play a role in maintaining conditions 
such as temperature, humidity, and gas levels to effectively support the embryo’s growth 
(Figure 8.1).
8.2 Monitoring Embryo Development
Morphological assessment: Assessments of the embryo’s morphology are subjec￾tive and depend on the skill of the embryologist. However, this challenge can be 
overcome by implementing monitoring and utilising objective criteria for select￾ing embryos with the assistance of time-lapse technology (Figure 8.2).
Typically, when evaluating embryos, we consider factors like cell number, symmetry, 
fragmentation, and the presence of cells. Embryos that have a cell count corresponding to 
their stage and that exhibit symmetrical characteristics are generally regarded as having 
good potential for viability. On the other hand, fragmentation indicates compromised 
quality, while multinucleated cells suggest issues with cell division and inferior embry￾onic quality.
During day 1 (16–18 hours after insemination), successful fertilisation is confirmed by 
observing two pronuclei. On days 2 and 3 (cleavage stage), assessments are made regard￾ing cell number, symmetry, and fragmentation.
As embryos progress to the blastocyst stage, their evaluation is based on their expansion 
level and the appearance of the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) layers.88 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
FIGURE 8.1
Schematic flowchart of embryo culture system.Quality Control in Embryo Culture 89
The Gardner grading system is commonly used to evaluate the quality of blastocysts in 
ART. It involves assigning a grade ranging from 1 to 6 that considers factors such as expan￾sion level, ICM quality (graded as A, B, or C), and TE quality (also graded as A, B, or C). 
This grading system helps classify embryos in ART procedures.
8.3 Timelapse Imaging
Timelapse imaging technology is a tool for embryologists to observe and monitor changes 
in embryos without causing any disturbance to their incubator environment. By analysing 
the development patterns and detecting any irregularities or delays in growth through 
these timelapse images, embryologists can select embryos for transfer, which ultimately 
increases the chances of a successful outcome. However, it is important to note that there 
may be variations in grading systems among embryologists due to individual subjectivity.
Another significant technique, preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), involves examin￾ing the composition of embryos to gain insights into their genetic health. This process 
includes extracting two to four trophectoderm cells from each embryo and subjecting 
them to analysis.
8.4 Metabolomic Profiling
Profiling is an approach that focuses on analysing metabolites, or molecules produced by 
cells during their metabolic processes. When applied to evaluating embryo quality, this 
method involves studying the culture medium. As an embryo develops, it interacts with 
FIGURE 8.2
Factors influencing embryo assessment.90 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
its environment by absorbing nutrients from the culture medium and releasing metabo￾lites into it. These metabolites encompass amino acids, proteins, sugars, and lipids; they 
essentially represent the end products of reactions within the embryo. By examining the 
presence, absence, or amounts of these metabolites, we can gain insights into an embryo’s 
metabolic health and potential.
Metabolomic profiling in culture media allows embryologists to assess alterations in 
composition without procedures. This assessment helps inform decisions regarding the 
selection of embryos for transfer or cryopreservation. Notably, while metabolomic profil￾ing holds promise, ongoing research and development are still exploring its practicality 
and usefulness in real-world applications.
Artificial intelligence (AI): Embryo assessment in ART has traditionally relied on 
the repetitive observation of embryos under a microscope throughout various 
stages of their development. However, this approach can be laborious, time con￾suming, and somewhat subjective, as it heavily relies on the experience and judge￾ment of the embryologist.
By leveraging algorithms, AI and machine learning (ML) technologies introduce objectiv￾ity and standardisation to embryo assessment. They eliminate variability by analysing 
the parameters of embryos more accurately and efficiently. The combination of AI and ML 
with time-lapse imaging techniques is particularly beneficial in handling large volumes 
of data related to embryonic development. This type of imaging generates data that can be 
challenging to analyse. However, AI and ML efficiently process this data, identifying pat￾terns and characteristics associated with embryonic development that may not be notice￾able to observers.
Additionally, AI and ML models have the ability to continuously learn and improve their 
accuracy over time by analysing accumulated data. This self-improvement aspect proves 
advantageous in enhancing the precision of the embryo selection process with each cycle.
However, it is important to recognise that the integration of AI and ML in ART is still 
in its early stages. While these technologies hold promise, further adoption and optimisa￾tion are necessary. Ongoing research and development efforts are focused on improving 
the performance and accessibility of AI and ML tools while also addressing regulatory 
considerations.
Embryo transfer: Before embryo transfer, it is important to conduct an evaluation of 
the patient’s medical history, the condition of their uterus, and the receptivity of 
their endometrium. This evaluation includes assessing and documenting factors 
like any issues with the uterus (like fibroids or polyps) as well as the thickness and 
appearance of the endometrium. It is crucial to identify and address any problems 
that could affect implantation, such as adhesions or chronic inflammation in the 
uterus.
It is crucial to follow techniques such as maintaining hand hygiene, using draping and 
equipment to prevent contamination, and reducing the chances of infections. Selecting the 
catheter for embryo transfer is of importance. It is crucial to take into account factors such 
as the traits of the patient, their experiences with transfers, and the expertise provided by 
embryologists. When using ultrasound guidance during the transfer process, it provides 
a representation of where the catheter tip is positioned inside the uterus cavity. To ensure 
placement and minimise any complications associated with catheter usage, it is crucial 
to adhere to the guidance provided by ultrasound imaging. After the embryo transfer, Quality Control in Embryo Culture 91
providing transfer care and regular follow-up is crucial for a successful implantation. It is 
also necessary to prescribe and administer medications like progesterone supplementa￾tion based on established protocols, scheduling follow-up appointments to monitor prog￾ress and evaluate implantation (Figure 8.3).
By highlighting correct procedures along with the significance of quality control mea￾sures, embryologists can contribute to achieving safe embryo transfer procedures in ART 
laboratories. Adhering to protocols, ensuring selection and verification of equipment, and 
providing comprehensive patient care are vital steps in attaining positive outcomes in 
ART procedures.
8.5 Troubleshooting Embryo Culture Problems
There are factors that can contribute to issues in embryo culture, including the composi￾tion of the culture media, incubator conditions, laboratory practices, and environmental 
FIGURE 8.3
Flowchart of steps leading to successful embryo transfer.92 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
factors. When troubleshooting these problems, it is important to take a comprehensive 
approach that considers all sources of variation and error.
These steps can be followed to address any issues.
Check the culture medium: Review the expiration date, storage conditions, and 
batch number of the medium used. Select a medium that matches the stage of 
embryonic development.
Evaluate the pH of the culture medium: The ideal pH for optimal embryonic devel￾opment is between 7.2–7.4. Factors such as the composition of the gas atmosphere 
and the sealing of the culture dish can affect pH levels.
Inspect culture dishes and microtools: Look at the quality and sterility of culture 
dishes, pipettes, and other microtools used in embryo manipulation. Always use cer￾tified plasticware that is non-toxic, and ensure cleaning and sterilisation before use.
Exposure: Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light can have negative effects on 
embryonic development. Limit embryos exposure to light as much as possible 
during manipulations. Use low-intensity illumination when needed.
Review handling techniques: Ensure that all laboratory personnel are well trained 
in embryo handling techniques to avoid temperature fluctuations or unnecessary 
manipulations during procedures. Assess lab workflow to minimise how long 
embryos are kept outside of incubators.
Ensure the quality of sperm and eggs: Assess the quality of gametes to avoid com￾promised embryos. Use quality sperm and eggs by evaluating preparation and 
selection techniques for fertilisation.
Prevent contamination: Contamination from bacteria or fungi can harm embryonic 
development. Maintain a sterile environment by sanitising work surfaces, equip￾ment, and incubators. Follow techniques and sterile handling procedures to mini￾mise the risk of contamination.
Monitor air quality in the laboratory: The presence of VOCs and particulate matter 
in the lab environment can impact embryonic development. Regularly check that 
air filtration systems are functioning optimally through air quality assessments.
Evaluate staff expertise: Assess the proficiency of laboratory personnel to main￾tain standards in an ART lab. All staff members should be well trained and expe￾rienced in IVF techniques, as human error can contribute to problems during 
embryo culturing, potentially affecting treatment outcomes.
Follow cryopreservation and thawing protocols: Freezing and thawing embryos 
require adherence to established protocols. Proper handling is essential for 
improving embryo survival rates.
Train personnel on embryo assessment: Provide training on techniques for assess￾ing and grading embryos. Accurate evaluation helps identify issues guiding deci￾sion-making throughout the ART process.
Designing and organising a laboratory: Optimise the design and layout of a labora￾tory to promote smooth workflows and minimise the risk of contamination. To 
prevent any possibility of cross-contamination, it is recommended to maintain 
separate areas for oocyte retrieval, embryo handling, and cryopreservation.
Quality management system: Implementing a quality management system (QMS) 
ensures that an ART laboratory consistently provides high-quality care for patients.Quality Control in Embryo Culture 93
Consideration of external factors: Consider the impact of external factors, such as 
stress, on individuals undergoing ART treatment.
Audits and inspections: Establish a schedule for conducting both internal and 
external audits; this helps to evaluate laboratory procedures and identify 
areas for improvement as well as ensures compliance with standards and 
regulations.
8.6 Issue 1: Poor Embryo Quality

Quality Control in Cryopreservation
9.1 Overview of Cryopreservation
Cryopreservation allows for preserving embryos, oocytes (eggs), and sperm for future use 
by cooling them to very low temperatures (–196 °C) in liquid nitrogen.
9.2 Procedures
• Storing surplus embryos from IVF for future use.
• Keeping sperm stored in cases where a male partner might have trouble provid￾ing a semen sample during egg collection due to medical reasons or personal 
circumstances.
• Preserving eggs for patients who are about to undergo chemotherapy or radiation 
therapy that could potentially harm their reproductive organs.
• Protecting testicular tissue for patients who face the risk of infertility due to cer￾tain conditions or treatments.
9.3 Fertility Preservation
Fertility preservation involves the storage of eggs, sperm, or embryos for future use. 
Medical treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy can have effects on organs 
and fertility. In women, these treatments can potentially harm eggs, while men may expe￾rience damage to their sperm or testes. Fertility preservation allows individuals to freeze 
their cells before undergoing treatment, thus improving their likelihood of having chil￾dren after treatment.
Delayed childbearing: Many people decide to postpone starting a family until later 
in life. However, it is important to note that a woman’s age significantly impacts 
her fertility, with fertility declining as age increases.96 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
Genetic disorders: Certain genetic conditions, such as Turner syndrome in women 
and Klinefelter syndrome in men, can make natural conception more challeng￾ing due to decreased production of eggs and sperm. In these cases, taking steps 
for fertility preservation can protect the possibility of having biological children 
later on.
9.4 Quality Control
Cooling rate: Vitrification uses much higher cooling rates, often exceeding –10,000 °C/
min, which aids in maintaining sample viability during cryopreservation.
Storage conditions of frozen sample: Maintain constant storage conditions for cryo￾preserved gametes, embryos, or tissues at –196 °C. It is advisable to have alarm 
systems and backup measures in place to mitigate any risks associated with tem￾perature fluctuations.
Warming and viability assessment: The temperature transition from –196 °C to 37 °C 
occurs at a rapid rate during the warming process of frozen samples. Typically, 
the warming rate used is approximately 180 °C to 200 °C per minute. After thaw￾ing, cell viability can be assessed based on morphological characteristics or other 
sample-specific practices.
Equipment maintenance: Regular maintenance and calibration of storage tanks and 
alarm equipment are essential for preserving the quality of stored samples.
Batch consistency: Request certificates from suppliers for every batch, as cer￾tificates provide information on quality control testing and batch-specific data. 
Additionally, cryopreservation media should be stored according to manufacturer 
recommendations.
Shelf life: Use cryopreservation media within its recommended shelf life. Avoid 
using expired media to ensure results.
SOPs: Maintain quality standards throughout the cryopreservation and warming 
process by developing and following SOPs for each stage.
Competency: Prioritise the training and proficiency of embryologists to uphold 
quality control. Regular assessments, education, and staying updated are crucial 
for laboratory personnel.
Documentation and tracking: Accurately document all samples, including their 
identification number, donor or patient information, collection date, processing 
details, and storage conditions.
Establish a defined sample tracking system that accurately identifies each sample’s loca￾tion and history. This system should include protocols for labelling and tracking samples 
during handling, processing, and storage as well as document any changes in sample 
location or status.
QMS: Implementing ISO 9001 or a similar quality management system can help 
manage and monitor aspects of freezing and warming in ART labs.Quality Control in Cryopreservation 97
9.5 Dilemma of Expired Embryo, Sperm, and Oocyte Storage
The preservation of embryos, sperm, and eggs through freezing has become an impor￾tant aspect of ART procedures. While the use of cryopreservation techniques has 
greatly facilitated fertility treatments, it has also presented challenges for fertility clin￾ics worldwide.
Accumulation: The consistent accumulation of cryopreserved embryos, sperm, and 
oocytes is significant. Following a successful birth, many decide against having 
more children, leading to the discontinuation of their interest in renewing the 
storage or donating the embryo to other potential parents or research.
Financial and logistical implications: Maintaining these cryopreserved materials 
entails not only the cost of storage but also the complexities associated with con￾sistent record-keeping. Clinics bear the burden of storage expenses and also face 
administrative challenges when managing these records.
The ethical challenge of discarding biological material: Deciding when and how to 
discard embryos presents an ethical challenge. While many clinics do have a time 
limit on storage, the act of discarding biological material, especially potential life 
forms, requires careful consideration.
Patient communication: Reaching out to patients to discuss the future of their stored 
material is an issue that clinics often encounter. While some individuals play a 
role in making decisions, others may be more difficult to reach or hesitant to make 
a choice, resulting in prolonged storage.
Regulatory solutions and informed consent: Regulatory bodies should develop 
guidelines regarding the duration of storage and the process of obtaining consent 
for disposal. By updating and clarifying the informed consent procedure, clin￾ics and patients can make informed choices about the future of stored embryos, 
sperm, and oocytes.
9.6 Troubleshooting Cryopreservation Problems
Thawing efficiency: It is crucial to optimise the thawing process to minimise harm to 
cells and maintain their viability. During the thawing process, even a small devia￾tion from the recommended thawing rate can impact cell viability. Embryos or 
oocytes need to be carefully managed during the thawing stage. Cryoprotectants 
can be harmful at high concentrations, therefore it is important to remove them 
gradually during the thawing process to prevent any damage to cells.
Ice crystal formation: Ice crystals have the potential to cause damage to the struc￾tures and membranes of cells, ultimately leading to their death.
Poor survival rates: If survival rates after thawing are low, it is advisable to evaluate 
the cryopreservation method in use and consider exploring alternative protocols. 
Adjusting practices may also help improve outcomes.98 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory

Key Performance Indicators
KPIs serve as reference points in fertility clinics, helping experts assess the effectiveness 
of treatments in reaching desired goals, such as pregnancies or live births. To gather KPI 
data, fertility clinics may perform interviews, review records, and conduct laboratory 
tests. These data points are thoroughly evaluated to determine how well treatment strate￾gies and interventions are working.
The Vienna consensus contributes to standardising practices in fertility clinics by defin￾ing KPIs, recommending data collection methodologies, and underscoring the importance 
of adjusting data based on variables such as patient age and medical history. The consen￾sus also highlights reporting methods and adjustments, resulting in comprehensive and 
fair performance assessments across clinics.
Quality control is another aspect that requires fertility clinic teams to understand the 
significance of KPIs in achieving their goals. Regular supervision of data collection pro￾cesses can help and involve spot-checking data entries, validating sources for accuracy, 
and ensuring adherence to established protocols.
Equally crucial is reviewing and assessing the procedures, calculations, and statisti￾cal analyses involved in data analysis to consider any factors that may impact results. 
Ensuring that staff receive training and certification is vital for maintaining the reliability 
of data collection and analysis. Additionally, fostering an environment that promotes com￾munication and feedback can help identify areas where processes can be improved. By

12.4 Clinical KPIs
In clinical KPIs, one important metric to consider is the number of eggs retrieved per 
patient or cumulatively across cycles. This metric provides insight into the efficiency of the 
egg retrieval process. Another crucial success indicator is clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), 
or the ratio of pregnancies to the number of embryo transfer procedures. Live birth rate 
(LBR) represents the proportion of births resulting from ART cycles and is a measure of 
overall treatment success. Implantation rate (IR) is a measure that reveals the proportion 
of transferred embryos and provides information about the quality of the embryos and the 
effectiveness of the transfer technique. Miscarriage rate (MR) indicates the proportion of 
pregnancies that result in miscarriage. These rates give insights into both the safety and 
effectiveness of treatments. Considering these metrics together provides an evaluation of 
a fertility clinic’s performance.
12.5 Laboratory KPIs
One important measure in the ART lab is the oocyte maturity rate (OMR), which allows 
direct assessment of the quality of oocytes during ICSI and aids in evaluating the success 
of stimulation protocols.
Methods used in sperm preparation, such as density gradient centrifugation and swim￾up techniques, influence the quality of sperm samples. Fertilisation rate (FR) is a metric Key Performance Indicators 127

are also monitored to understand embryonic growth and factors leading to pregnancies. 
Another vital metric is the success rate of PGT, which indicates the precision of biopsy 
techniques and the efficiency of testing procedures.
Critical KPIs encompass the survival rate of embryos and the count of cryopreserved 
oocytes or embryos both per patient and cumulatively across multiple cycles.
12.6 Management KPIs
The rate at which cycles are cancelled, known as the cycle cancellation rate (CCR), is a 
metric that evaluates how well patients are managed and gives insight into the success of 
treatments. Another crucial indicator is the time-to-pregnancy (TTP). This metric not only 
shows how effective treatment strategies are but also directly measures patient satisfac￾tion. It contributes to an understanding of the patient experience.
Turnaround time (TAT) is a measure of the clinic’s efficiency. It calculates the duration 
from when an ART cycle starts until it is completed or terminated. At the same time, 
analysing retention and dropout rates gives valuable insights into how well the clinic per￾forms. These rates help determine how successful labs are in creating a comfortable envi￾ronment for patients and retaining them after unsuccessful cycles.
Together, these KPIs provide a view of the clinic’s efficiency, patient satisfaction, and 
overall effectiveness in fertility treatment strategies. They play a role in improving prac￾tices, managing quality, and advancing knowledge within the field of fertility treatment.
12.7 Measurement and Tracking of KPIs
Establishing uniform guidelines and optimal practices, such as those outlined in the 
Istanbul Consensus Workshop on Embryo Assessment, is essential to standardising and 
controlling the quality of KPI measurement in ART. These guidelines offer a universal 
standard for grading and assessing embryos. Implementing external quality assessment 
programmes and proficiency evaluations is vital to confirming laboratories’ compliance 
with established standards. These initiatives are essential in determining the laboratory’s 
aptitude and consistency in generating reliable and accurate outcomes.

ART Lab Witnessing Systems
In the intricate environment of the ART lab, every procedure’s accuracy is of paramount 
importance. The witnessing system serves as an essential component, offering a critical 
layer of quality control to ensure precision and reliability. The process leverages two key 
roles: 1) the performer who conducts the ART procedure and 2) the witness, a vigilant 
observer who authenticates each step without direct participation in the procedure itself. 
This dual-control approach minimises errors, ensuring safety and efficacy.
The witness primarily validates the correlation between the patient and the treatment 
while affirming the correct use of medications and equipment, thereby ensuring that stan￾dardised protocols are maintained. Simultaneously, the performer implements the ART 
procedure, adhering to set protocols and maintaining clear communication with the wit￾ness. This cooperation promotes accountability and seamless procedural execution.
The significance of witnessing an ART lab is manifold. It helps prevent potential errors 
and mix-ups, thereby averting catastrophic outcomes for patients and their families. It 
reinforces the accuracy and consistency of procedures, bolstering patient safety by con￾firming the suitability of the medications and equipment used. Witnessing also enhances 
procedure transparency, increasing patient trust and confidence in the process.
Different types of witnessing include technical, procedural, and interpretative witness￾ing. In technical witnessing, the witness ensures that all equipment is utilised correctly 
and calibrated and that samples are handled appropriately. They also carry out quality 
control checks to swiftly identify and rectify any discrepancies.
Procedural witnessing entails the witness confirming the correct identification and 
treatment of patients. This role requires careful tracking and verification of samples along 
with stringent adherence to labelling and documentation standards, thereby maintaining 
procedural integrity.
Interpretative witnessing involves the witness validating the precision and reliability of 
testing outcomes. They also ensure that established quality control standards are met for 
all procedures and that any errors identified are promptly rectified. Each type of witness￾ing is essential in its own way, contributing to the overall quality and safety of procedures 
in the ART lab.
13.1 Manual Witnessing System
Manual witnessing involves assigning two witnesses who are laboratory technicians or 
embryologists with the expertise to oversee and validate the handling of gametes and 
embryos throughout the entire process.
The witnesses are responsible for steps including preparation, egg fertilisation, embryo 
culture, and freezing. At the end of each procedure, these witnesses confirm the procedure’s ART Lab Witnessing Systems 133
accuracy by signing a document. This document is then stored in the clinic’s records as a 
point of reference for any disputes or investigations regarding procedures.
Manual witnessing goes beyond being a formality; it serves as a mechanism to maintain 
the quality and precision of ART procedures. Despite advancements, it remains a practised 
approach in ART labs worldwide (Tables 13.1 and 13.2).

Case Studies
14.1 Examples of Successful Quality Control Practices
To uphold standards, it is crucial to incorporate QMS. An exemplary QMS practice in 
an ART lab involves integrating a programme that includes staff training, competency 
assessments, and participation in external quality assurance initiatives. This multi-faceted 
approach ensures that all lab personnel are well trained and regularly evaluated for their 
competence, thus maintaining excellence over time (Figure 14.1).
Implementing such a programme can lead to improvements across numerous areas 
within an ART lab. It enhances efficiency, reliability, and the success of procedures per￾formed. Moreover, it helps minimise errors, improve outcomes, and ensure compliance 
with regulations and standards. In essence, the systematic application of a QMS signifi￾cantly contributes to the performance and reputation of an ART lab; it is truly indispensable.
Recognising the importance of quality and safety in ART clinics, the ESHRE has devoted 
efforts towards developing guidelines for quality management in these clinics. These 
guidelines include recommendations on laboratory design, equipment usage, and SOPs.
Additionally, the College of American Pathologists offers accreditation programmes 
along with proficiency testing programmes specifically designed for ART labs. These pro￾grammes offer evaluations of quality from various sources as well as providing oppor￾tunities for laboratories to assess their performance compared to other labs and identify 
areas for improvement.
As an example, the ART laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) 
implemented a programme to enhance the consistency and excellence of embryo transfer 
procedures. This involved staff training, competency assessments, and the integration of 
time-lapse imaging to monitor embryo development and transfer. The outcomes of this 
programme were impressive, with improvements in implantation and live birth rates.
Recognising the importance of maintaining high quality service standards, the Fertility 
Centre of Las Vegas implemented a programme that included operating procedures, regu￾lar equipment maintenance, ongoing staff education, and active participation in quality 
assurance initiatives.
Additionally, the Colorado Centre for Reproductive Medicine (CCRM) has enacted a 
quality control protocol aimed at standardising procedures and ensuring reliable test 
results. This programme has produced outcomes that include increases in conception 
rates and a reduction in the number of embryos required per reproductive cycle. CCRM’s 
commitment to improving fertility outcomes and providing care is evident through their

FIGURE 14.1
Overview of TQMS in ART labs.Case Studies 143
patient information, laboratory processes, and results. This system aided in enhancing the 
precision and uniformity of data collection, consequently resulting in advancements in 
ART outcomes.
14.2 Real-World Examples of QC in ART Labs
In recent years, there have been reports about mistakes occurring in ART clinics world￾wide during IVF procedures. These unfortunate incidents emphasise the importance of 
quality control and adherence to best practices in managing IVF treatments. For example, 
during the mid-2010s, couples discovered that implanted embryos were not genetically 
related to them. 
In the early 2020s, incidents involving mix-ups with sperm came to light. This also led 
to babies being born without any connection to their intended fathers. In some instances, 
these mix-ups were only discovered after birth, resulting in emotional upheaval for the 
affected families.
An interesting case from the 2000s involved a couple who expected twins through IVF 
but were surprised when their babies displayed different ethnic characteristics than them￾selves. This indicated a mix-up of material during the IVF process.
These events are a reminder of how important it is for fertility clinics to have quality 
control measures in place. Errors can have an impact on families, raising concerns about 
the protocols used to ensure accurate handling and identification of genetic material in 
these clinics.
14.3 Preventing Mix-Ups
Mix-ups and witnessing failure are serious errors that occur in ART labs, requiring differ￾ent approaches to prevention and mitigation.
There is a possibility of mix-ups occurring due to mishandling of samples or during the 
embryo transfer process. For instance, there could be errors of using samples meant for 
one patient on another or unintentionally mixing up samples from patients. Confusion 
may also arise from communication and documentation mistakes in certain situations. 
To prevent these mix-ups, it is important to ensure that all patient samples are properly 
labelled, strict adherence to operating procedures is followed, and regular staff training on 
handling and labelling protocols is conducted. Some labs also use systems to verify identi￾ties and ensure that the correct samples are used.
Witnessing failure refers to when the system designed to guarantee the use of gametes, 
embryos, or samples for each patient breaks down. This can occur due to sample labelling 
or staff members not following procedures.
To prevent witnessing failures in ART labs, it is crucial to establish a witnessing system. 
This involves implementing procedures that accurately verify identities, carefully label￾ling all samples with identifiers, and diligently tracking sample movement throughout 
the lab.
The implementation of witnessing systems can provide a layer of protection, minimising 
the chances of mistakes and offering an added level of verification.144 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
It is essential for ART laboratories to have protocols in place to address incidents where 
mix-ups or witnessing failures occur. These protocols should involve promptly informing 
both patients and their medical practitioners about the error, providing counselling and sup￾port to those affected, and conducting a review of existing lab procedures to prevent errors.
Mix-ups in IVF procedures have led to distress and legal disputes for families world￾wide. The examples mentioned emphasise the importance of having quality assurance 
measures and transparency in fertility clinics to minimise the possibility of such errors. 
Furthermore, these incidents highlight the necessity for enhanced support services and 
counselling for individuals impacted by IVF errors, as well as a robust legal framework to 
handle the consequences of such mistakes.
CHAPTER 14

Emerging Trends and Best Practices:
New Technologies in QC
Advancements in ART laboratories have brought improvements to QC. These innovations 
aim to enhance accuracy, safety, and efficiency in ART procedures, ultimately improving 
the level of healthcare provided to patients.
One advanced approach used for sperm evaluation is CASA. Compared to other 
techniques, CASA methods provide accurate assessments of sperm samples. By offer￾ing real-time assessment of sperm parameters, CASA technology delivers data for 
analysis.
Time-lapse imaging technology captures the growth and division patterns of embryos, 
providing insights for selecting embryos and increasing the chances of implantation.
The advent of PGT has revolutionised embryonic assessment for abnormalities and 
genetic mutations. Modern PGT techniques, like next-generation sequencing (NGS) and 
array genomic hybridisation (aCGH), offer enhanced accuracy and comprehensive genetic 
testing capabilities, reducing the risk of genetic disorders or miscarriage.
Non-invasive preimplantation genetic testing (niPGT) involves extracting material from 
the culture medium surrounding the embryo instead of performing an invasive biopsy on 
the embryo itself. This approach minimises invasiveness while still providing information 
(Figure 15.1).
Various noninvasive methods exist to assess the quality and viability of embryos, 
including time lapse imaging, metabolomics, and proteomics. Unlike other procedures, 
these methods provide information about embryo development, cell division patterns, and 
metabolic profiles without causing any damage.
Digital quality control systems like laboratory notebooks and laboratory information 
management systems have improved data management and accuracy in documentation. 
They help reduce the likelihood of errors or omissions in ART laboratories.
The concept of patient-centred care has gained prominence in ART treatments. It 
emphasises approaches that cater to patients’ needs and preferences. This comprehensive 
approach focuses not only on procedures but also provides emotional support through 
counselling, support groups, and complementary therapies.
Standardised quality indicators have been developed to assess the quality of ART pro￾cedures and outcomes. These indicators promote consistency and reliability across clinics 
and countries, enabling comparisons and benchmarking.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) is a technique that provides detailed infor￾mation about gene expression and cell differentiation during embryo development. 
These techniques offer insights into mechanisms and potential biomarkers for selecting 
embryos.146 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory

outcomes.
During oocyte retrieval, robotic systems can assist by positioning the needle used to 
collect follicles. They can be programmed to calculate the angle and depth for needle 
insertion, which increases procedure accuracy while minimising harm to surrounding 
tissues.
In ICSI, a procedure that requires precision, robots offer significant advantages. They 
provide control and stability, enabling the immobilisation and injection of a single sperm 
into an oocyte. Robotic systems can also assist in monitoring the injection process to ensure 
delivery of the sperm while minimising any risk of damage to the oocyte.
Robotic automation is also utilised in embryo culture, where maintaining controlled 
and consistent conditions is vital for embryo development.
Robots in incubators can maintain optimal conditions, ensuring appropriate tempera￾ture, humidity, and gas concentrations; this reduces the need for monitoring and handling 
embryos, minimising disturbances and improving the chances of embryo growth.
The use of robotics in ART labs has advantages. Automation decreases reliance on 
labour, freeing up embryologists to focus on complex tasks. It enhances consistency and 
precision, since robotic systems can perform tasks without variation or errors. This stan￾dardisation improves the reliability and reproducibility of ART procedures, leading to 
improved patient outcomes.
Moreover, automation streamlines processes in ART labs by optimising workflow and 
reducing procedure times. Integrating robotics with intelligence and time-lapse imaging 
allows data integration and analysis, further enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of 
ART procedures.
While robotic automation offers several benefits, in ART labs it is important to note that

immense. Techniques that focus on analysing cells provide an understanding of embryo 
quality, genetic abnormalities, and developmental potential. By studying the genetic char￾acteristics of each cell, ART labs can make more informed choices when selecting embryos, 
which in turn leads to higher success rates and decreases the likelihood of genetic disorders.
15.7 Data Integration and Standardisation
The future of QC in ART labs depends on the integration and standardisation of data. 
ART labs have the opportunity to create databases that create treatment plans by combin￾ing information from different sources, such as patient records, lab results, and treatment 
outcomes. By standardising methods for collecting, storing, and analysing data, ART labs 
can ensure consistency and promote collaboration. This ultimately leads to enhanced QC 
practices and the ability to compare performance benchmarks.
15.8 Artificial Gametes
Artificial gametes, also known as in vitro-derived gametes, are created through laboratory 
techniques that aim to generate functional sperm or eggs outside the human body. This 
new technology holds promise for individuals and couples facing infertility or those with 
genetic disorders who wish to conceive. While artificial gametes are still in the early stages 
of development, ongoing research is focused on fine-tuning their products and ensuring 
their safety and efficacy.
15.9 Quality Control Challenges in Artificial Gametes
The development and utilisation of artificial gametes present unique challenges regarding 
quality control. Ensuring that these synthetic gametes possess the necessary characteristics Emerging Trends and Best Practices 151
and functionality is crucial. QC protocols must be established to assess artificial gametes’ 
quality, genetic integrity, and developmental potential. This involves a rigorous evaluation 
of morphology, genetic stability, epigenetic modifications, and the ability to undergo suc￾cessful fertilisation and embryonic development.
15.10 Genetic Engineering and Genome Editing
Artificial gametes introduce possibilities for genetic engineering and genome editing 
techniques. QC processes in ART labs must address the ethical considerations and poten￾tial risks associated with manipulating the genetic material of artificial gametes. Stringent 
quality control measures should be implemented to verify the accuracy, safety, and ethical 
implications of any genetic modifications introduced.
15.11 Safety and Long-Term Health

Safety, Recommendations, and Infrastructure
16.1 Safety Measures in ART Labs
ART labs must adhere to safety protocols to minimise the risk of contamination and nega￾tive consequences. In ART laboratories, there is a need to handle substances such as cryo￾protectants and biological samples, which necessitates the correct utilisation of personal 
protective equipment and adherence to safe practices.
Risk assessment: Risk assessment is a process that involves identifying and estimat￾ing hazards in a workplace, especially in ART labs, where safety is paramount. 
Handling specimens comes with a risk of exposure to these pathogens. One 
risk is the possibility of being injured by a needle, which results in exposure to 
pathogens. In addition to considering the management, storage, and disposal of 
chemicals, it is important to include measures such as the provision of protective 
equipment to decrease any potential exposure risks.
Moreover, physical hazards like radiation (UV), electrical hazards, and sharp objects 
should be evaluated carefully. It is crucial to assess the risks associated with operating 
equipment while implementing safety protocols that prioritise accident prevention. This 
entails considering how frequently people may be exposed to these hazards, understand￾ing the consequences of exposure, and assessing the effectiveness. Some examples of con￾trol measures may include installing safety cabinets or hoods for processes or developing 
SOPs that outline safe practices for staff members.
Conducting a risk assessment that considers factors like frequency of exposure, poten￾tial consequences, and the efficacy of existing control measures, along with providing 
thorough training for all staff members, can ensure a safer working environment within 
ART labs.
Risk assessment should also consider the psychological impact of the work. The work in 
ART labs can be emotionally demanding and stressful. Therefore, providing mental health 
support and stress management strategies is also important. Safety assessments must be 
reviewed to ensure that they remain updated with any modifications in the laboratory 
setting.
Personal protective equipment: PPE plays a role in safeguarding laboratory staff 
from exposure to hazardous materials in ART labs. To ensure the safety of the 
staff, ART labs should carefully evaluate the chemical or physical risks involved 
and select PPE accordingly. It is important that the chosen PPE effectively protect 
against these identified hazards and adhere to safety standards.154 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
Aside from providing protection, it is essential to consider the fit and comfort of the 
PPE. Ill-fitting or uncomfortable PPE may compromise its effectiveness by discouraging 
usage. Therefore, it is necessary to choose PPE that fits well and allows for movement. 
Consistently wearing the designated PPE whenever staff members are in contact with 
materials, performing procedures, or working in risky areas is critical for minimising con￾tamination risks. By following this practice, we can create an environment that reduces the 
likelihood of exposure incidents. Notably, PPE may become contaminated during use, and 
prolonged usage can compromise its capabilities. Thus, staff members should be encour￾aged to change their PPE as needed—especially when transitioning between workstations 
or handling materials.
Proper training on how to use, handle, and dispose of PPE is necessary for all staff 
members working in ART labs. This training ensures that everyone understands how 
to maximise the effectiveness of their equipment while minimising any associated 
risks.
Hazardous materials: When it comes to disinfectants and cleaning agents, ART labs 
follow protocols for handling, labelling, and storage.
Liquid nitrogen: The storage area should be equipped with fire extinguishers 
and emergency eye-wash stations to ensure safety precautions are in place. (See 
Chapter 10.)
Laboratory waste: In ART labs, hazardous waste requires proper categorisation, 
handling, and disposal to reduce the risk of exposure to dangerous substances. 
ART labs should have designated containers for collecting waste that also ensure 
compatibility with the disposed chemicals. These containers must be labelled 
appropriately to indicate the nature of the associated hazards.
Safety protocols: To minimise exposure to materials in an ART laboratory, it is 
important to have safety protocols in place. These guidelines should encom￾pass the upkeep of equipment and incident reporting. ART labs are advised 
to establish procedures for equipment maintenance that include disinfection 
protocols.
Proper laboratory design: Designing an ART lab requires careful attention to detail 
to ensure an effective, secure, and prosperous working environment.
When designing an IVF lab, several key measures should be considered.
Layout and zoning: When designing the layout of ART lab, it is important to con￾sider how the staff, samples, and materials will move within the space. The goal 
is to create a layout that promotes a workflow of activities and ensures access to 
each zone. Regularly evaluating and zoning the lab can facilitate identifying areas 
where improvements can be made. Gathering feedback from staff members and 
analysing patterns informs adjustments that align with the changing needs of the 
lab while optimising efficiency (Figure 16.1).
Flooring and surfaces: It is important for workstations to be resistant to chemicals, 
moisture, and heat. Floors and wall coverings minimise the presence of crevices 
and joints where dirt and dust build up, resulting in easier cleaning and mainte￾nance while ensuring sterility.155 Safety, Recommendations, and Infrastructure FIGURE 16.1 Layout of a standard ART clinic.156 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
HVAC system: An HVAC system plays a role in maintaining a clean environment 
for the ART lab by ensuring optimal temperatures, proper humidity levels, and 
ventilation.
Airlock entry: Airlocks or anterooms should be installed at the entrances to critical 
areas to minimise the introduction of contaminants. This creates a buffer zone 
where staff change into protective clothing and footwear before entering the main 
lab space.
Embryo transfer room: Design a comfortable and private embryo transfer room for 
patients to undergo the procedure. This room should be adjacent to the embryo 
culture area to minimise the time and distance between the transfer and the 
incubators.
Storage and organisation: To maintain a clutter-free and well-organised lab, it is 
essential to thoughtfully design the storage areas for consumables, reagents, and 
equipment. Vertical spaces can be efficiently utilised with storage solutions such 
as cabinets, shelves, and drawers.
Emergency safety features: These should include eye-wash stations, fire extinguish￾ers, and marked emergency exits in case of accidents or emergencies. Additionally, 
the safety data sheets (SDSs) for all chemicals used in the lab should be within 
easy reach.
Ergonomics: Proper ergonomic design helps reduce strain on laboratory personnel 
and enhances productivity, like adjustable chairs, tables, and equipment stands to 
accommodate the needs of individual users.
Electrical: There should be sufficient electrical outlets and data ports, and using 
uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems can protect sensitive equipment dur￾ing power fluctuations or outages.
Acoustic control: Keeping noise levels in the lab as low as possible is beneficial. 
A  quieter lab environment lowers stress for the staff and, interestingly, the 
embryos. Research indicates that too much noise might adversely affect embry￾onic development.
Vibration control: Equipment sensitive to vibrations should be positioned away 
from potential sources of vibration, like air handling units, elevators, or areas with 
a lot of foot traffic.
Safety and security: Due to the sensitive nature of their operations, ART facili￾ties must implement stringent security measures to protect patient privacy 
(Figure 16.2).
Waste management: Designing a waste management system requires careful plan￾ning to ensure compliance with local regulations, especially when dealing with 
hazardous and non-hazardous waste. The system should have dedicated disposal 
areas for different types of waste that are clearly labelled for correct usage.
Sustainability: As part of the lab design, it would be beneficial to embrace sustain￾ability and use energy-saving lighting options, low-flow water fixtures, and mate￾rials that are friendly to the environment.
Cryopreservation room: It is crucial to have ventilation and gas detection systems in 
place to constantly monitor oxygen levels and promptly detect any nitrogen leaks 
or oxygen depletion. It is imperative to restrict access to authorised personnel to 
safeguard samples and confidentiality.Safety, Recommendations, and Infrastructure 157
Staff facilities: Space within the facility should be allocated for employees to conve￾niently change clothes, store their belongings, and take breaks. It is important to 
provide lockers and restrooms for their convenience.
Future expansion: Designing the laboratory flexibly prepares it for growth and pos￾sible technological advancements. There should be room for expansion and adapt￾ability to accommodate any developments in ART techniques, equipment, and 
procedures that may arise.
16.2 Environmental Impact
With increasing attention on sustainability and environmental consciousness, it becomes 
essential for ART labs, like any other sector, to consider their environmental footprint.
ART laboratories, due to their nature of work, consume significant amounts of energy and 
produce waste. The high energy consumption is due to the need for constant temperature 
control and air quality management, which are crucial to maintain the integrity of embryos. 
In addition, ART labs generate a considerable amount of biomedical waste, including used 
culture media, plastic consumables, gloves, pipettes, and other lab materials.
Labs could also explore options for recycling non-hazardous waste. Moreover, adopt￾ing paperless operations wherever possible, using eco-friendly supplies, and promoting 
sustainable practices among the staff can further contribute to reducing the lab’s environ￾mental footprint.
It is evident that environmental considerations are an integral part of risk management 
in ART labs. By adopting sustainable practices, these labs can not only reduce their envi￾ronmental footprint but also improve their efficiency and resilience.

16.3 TQMS for a Chain of Fertility Clinics
Fertility centre chains are especially beneficial for individuals and couples residing in 
underserved areas with access to fertility services. The advantage of having multiple loca￾tions is added convenience and flexibility when it comes to scheduling appointments and 
procedures.
However, it is important to keep in mind that not all fertility clinics are the same, and 
the success rates of ART treatments can vary between clinics. It is crucial to research and 
select a fertility clinic with experienced medical professionals and a proven track record 
of high success rates.
Advancements: ART advancements encompass aspects such as enhanced embryo 
assessment, improved stimulation techniques, ICSI allowing embryos to develop 
further before transfer (blastocyst culture), and the option to freeze embryos for 
future use. As a result of these progressions, there has been an increase in demand 
for fertility treatments, leading to the expansion of fertility clinics and chains. 
However, despite these developments, success rates can still vary depending on 
factors such as age, overall health, and underlying causes of infertility.
Increase in demand: Infertility is a concern that affects an estimated 10% of couples 
around the world, and societal attitudes towards infertility have evolved over time, 
reducing the stigma associated with seeking fertility treatments. The introduction 
of cryopreservation techniques has also given rise to a trend in ART where indi￾viduals seek treatment for fertility issues and consider preserving their fertility. 
To meet the growing demand, fertility clinics have expanded their services and 
formed chains to cater to a wider population more efficiently.
Globalisation: With the growth of globalisation, people are increasingly seeking fer￾tility services across borders. This has created a demand for fertility clinics that 
provide consistent, high-quality care across multiple locations. By expanding their 
reach across multiple regions, fertility clinic chains can effectively cater to patients 
who require assistance.
Resource and expertise pooling: Fertility clinic chains can pool their resources and 
expertise across multiple locations, allowing them to offer a broader range of ser￾vices and treatments to patients and share knowledge among different clinics.
Economies of scale: Fertility clinics that operate in multiple locations take advantage 
of economies of scale. By purchasing equipment and supplies in bulk and stream￾lining processes, they can save costs. These savings are then passed on to patients 
through cost and accessible treatment options.
16.4 Implementing Total Quality Management 
Systems in Fertility Clinic Chains
TQMS, also known as a total quality management system, is a strategy aimed at enhancing 
the quality and effectiveness of a business or organisation.
The following steps can be used to implement a TQMS in a chain of fertility clinics.Safety, Recommendations, and Infrastructure 159
Vision and mission: The vision and mission should effectively express the purpose, 
values, and objectives of the organisation, serving as a compass for decision-mak￾ing and day-to-day operations at every level.
The vision statement should describe the future state the organisation strives to 
achieve. The vision for a fertility clinic chain might be ‘to become the leading pro￾vider of compassionate and effective fertility care, empowering individuals and 
couples to achieve their dream of building a family’.
The mission statement plays a role in defining the purpose and strategies of an 
organisation to fulfil its vision. For example, a fertility clinic chain may have a 
mission statement like this: ‘Our aim is to offer inclusive and individualised fertil￾ity treatments to both individuals and couples. We utilise cutting-edge technolo￾gies and techniques while providing care that is empathetic, compassionate, and 
respectful’. Objectives should be specific, measurable, and achievable.
Develop a quality policy: A quality policy reflects the organisation’s commitment 
to excellence, outlines its expectations for performance and accountability, and 
guides decision-making and operations across all levels of the organisation.
16.5 Define Key Performance Indicators
Patient satisfaction is an indispensable KPI, as it measures the level of satisfaction among 
patients with the clinic’s services. (See Chapter 13.)
16.6 Establish a Quality Management Team
Identify team members: The quality management team should include representa￾tives from all levels of the organisation, including senior leadership, clinicians, 
nurses, lab technicians, and administrative staff.
Each team member needs defined roles and responsibilities for clear account￾ability. Team members must also undergo training on TQMS principles and meth￾odologies. The development and enforcement of SOPs for critical processes are 
vital for maintaining consistent operations. The use of technology can enhance 
operations, reduce errors, and improve patient care. A  culture of continuous 
improvement should be promoted, where employees identify and implement 
beneficial changes. Moreover, regular audits and reviews of the TQMS ensure its 
effectiveness and identify areas for refinement.
Implement SOPs: Embracing the use of technology such as EHRs and practice man￾agement software can bring about multiple improvements. Electronic records 
helps streamline operations, reduce errors, and enhance the level of care provided 
to patients. In addition, fostering a culture of improvement among staff mem￾bers plays a role in ensuring better patient care and operational efficiency. (See

both in person and virtually, to discuss issues and share best practices. Cross-training 
employees across different departments enhances understanding and collaboration, while 
a resource-sharing system boosts efficiency. Encouraging a culture of knowledge sharing 
stimulates innovation and continuous learning. Initiating collaborative projects tackles 
common issues and improves overall patient care.
Accreditation: Being accredited by a third party is a way for the clinic chain to 
demonstrate its dedication to quality and safety, which helps it stand out from 
competitors and gain trust from both patients and staff. This accreditation pro￾cess involves staff training to improve performance and skills. It also provides a 
structure for improvement through monitoring and performance evaluation. An 
important aspect of accreditation is the emphasis on operations to ensure that the 
clinic chain follows regulations and guidelines, underscoring their commitment 
to patient care and safety.Safety, Recommendations, and Infrastructure 161
16.8 Performance Recognition
Implementing employee recognition programmes that recognise and reward these efforts 
boosts morale, encourages staff retention, and garners public recognition through avenues 
like newsletters or social media that can serve as motivation for staff.
Furthermore, actively seeking employee feedback fosters a collaborative environment 
where employees feel valued and engaged in improvement initiatives. Offering develop￾ment opportunities related to quality improvement further demonstrates the clinic’s com￾mitment to staff growth.
Organising team-building activities that acknowledge the contributions of staff mem￾bers promotes teamwork, effective communication, and an overall culture of excellence 
across departments.
Investing in TQMS results in long-term financial benefits for fertility clinics, including 
reduced costs due to increased efficiency; higher patient satisfaction, leading to increased 
referrals; and improved employee retention, reducing recruitment and training costs.
CHAPTER 16
SUMMARY
• Safety is paramount in ART labs to protect patients, staff, and the environment.
• Healthcare providers and infertility clinics should prioritise safety by estab￾lishing comprehensive safety programmes and regularly reviewing and 
updating safety protocols.
• Staff should receive proper safety training and follow strict guidelines for 
handling and disposing of hazardous materials.
• Infertility clinics should have a designated safety officer responsible for 
overseeing safety measures and maintaining compliance with regulatory 
standards.
• Fire extinguishers and eye-wash stations, among other emergency sup￾plies, must be easily accessible and always available. Inspections and audits 
of ART labs identify potential safety hazards and support ongoing safety 
improvements.
• Training and drills for emergency scenarios prepare staff for unexpected 
events and improve response times in an emergency.
• ART labs should have proper labelling and identification protocols for haz￾ardous materials to minimise the risk of accidental exposure.
PROPER LABORATORY DESIGN
• It is recommended that laboratories be equipped with appropriate lighting 
to promote a well-illuminated workspace and minimise the likelihood of 
mishaps.162 Quality Control in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory
• Floors, walls, and ceilings should be constructed of materials that are easy to 
clean and maintain to minimise the risk of contamination and infection.
• Adequate space should be available to accommodate equipment, staff, and 
workflow needs.
• Equipment should be properly maintained and regularly calibrated to main￾tain accuracy and minimise the risk of equipment failure.
• Storage areas for hazardous materials should be adequately ventilated and 
secure to minimise the risk of accidental exposure or theft.
• Laboratories should have proper signage to identify hazardous materials 
and emergency equipment.
• Emergency exit routes should be clearly marked, unobstructed, and easily 
accessible in an emergency.
• Electrical outlets and wiring should be properly grounded and installed to 
minimise the risk of electrical hazards.
• Laboratories should have proper insulation to maintain a stable temperature 
and humidity level, which is needed for maintaining the integrity of biologi￾cal samples.
• The laboratory should be appropriately sealed and have a secure entrance to 
minimise the risk of unauthorised access.
TQMS FOR A CHAIN OF FERTILITY CLINICS
• Fertility clinic chains have multiple locations and offer a more extensive 
reach of services, providing convenience and flexibility for patients.
• Advancements in assisted reproductive technologies and increased demand 
for fertility services have contributed to the growth of fertility clinic chains.
• Fertility clinic chains benefit from resource and expertise pooling; econo￾mies of scale; and the ability to provide consistent, high-quality care across 
multiple locations.
• Implementing a TQMS for a chain of fertility clinics enhances patient care, 
streamlines operations, and improves overall performance.
• Steps to implement TQMS for a chain of fertility clinics include establish￾ing a clear vision and mission, developing a quality policy, defining key 
performance indicators, establishing a quality management team, imple￾menting standard operating procedures, utilising technology, fostering a 
culture of continuous improvement, encouraging collaboration, pursuing 
accreditation, addressing ethical considerations, and recognising employee 
performance.
Investing in TQMS results in long-term financial benefits for fertility clinics.163
