About This eBook
ePUB is an open, industry-standard format for eBooks. However, support of
ePUB and its many features varies across reading devices and applications.
Use your device or app settings to customize the presentation to your liking.
Settings that you can customize often include font, font size, single or
double column, landscape or portrait mode, and figures that you can click
or tap to enlarge. For additional information about the settings and features
on your reading device or app, visit the device manufacturer’s Web site.
Many titles include programming code or configuration examples. To
optimize the presentation of these elements, view the eBook in single￾column, landscape mode and adjust the font size to the smallest setting. In
addition to presenting code and configurations in the reflowable text format,
we have included images of the code that mimic the presentation found in
the print book; therefore, where the reflowable format may compromise the
presentation of the code listing, you will see a “Click here to view code
image” link. Click the link to view the print-fidelity code image. To return
to the previous page viewed, click the Back button on your device or app.Sheet Layouts
Useful sheet size and title block information is shown here. All of the
dimensions are in inches except for Fig. VII, where the example on the right
is in millimeters and shows a typical tolerance block for a metric drawing.
Most CAD systems provide standard title blocks that you can insert
automatically. Use layouts similar to these or blocks available in your CAD
system as assigned by your instructor. If assigned, use the proportions
shown here and design your own custom title block that provides the
necessary information.

ISBN 13: 978-0-13-827187-9About this Book
Engineers, technicians, and designers need to master a variety of graphical communication
techniques, from sketching concepts, such as these backpack designs, to creating detailed three￾dimensional models suitable for analysis of design features. (Courtesy of André Cotan.)
Modern Graphics Communication presents practices and techniques of
sketching, visualization, design, and CAD that are important to today’s
graphics curriculum. Based on the long-standing authoritative text on the
subject, Giesecke’s Technical Drawing, this text preserves the time-tested
graphics techniques that remain fundamental to the class, as it expands on
the role that the 3D CAD database plays in design and documentation.The topics of sketching and visualization skills are this book’s primary
focus and provide a solid conceptual basis for the CAD instruction most
graphics students receive. This edition also illustrates the application of
both 3D and 2D modeling and technical drawing skills to real-world
situations, and includes several in-depth case studies that link chapter
content to industry practice. Each chapter lays a conceptual foundation that
anchors the detailed sections on technique that follow. A wealth of step-by￾step illustrated guides, worksheets, and end-of-chapter exercises help
students visualize, practice, and retain those key concepts and techniques.
Students who complete Modern Graphics Communication will leave with a
full repertoire of skills—plus a lasting reference book—that they will find
invaluable both in education and industry.

About the Authors
Frederick E. Giesecke, founder of the first formal architectural education
program in Texas at what is today Texas A&M University, has been
described as “a wunderkind of the first magnitude.” He joined the A&M
faculty at the age of 17, after graduating in 1886 with a B.S. in Mechanical
Engineering. By the age of 19, was appointed head of A&M’s Department
of Mechanical Drawing.Having studied architectural drawing and design at Cornell University and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Giesecke also served as head of
the Department of Architecture and the official college architect at Texas
A&M, designing many campus buildings that are still standing today.
A long-time admirer of Giesecke’s legacy, Shawna Lockhart was honored
to carry on the commitment to clear, engaging, thorough, and well￾organized presentation that began with the original author.
Lockhart is known as an early adopter and authority on CAD technologies.
She is an instructor noted for outstanding dedication to students and for
encouraging a broad spectrum of individuals, particularly women and
minorities, to follow careers in engineering-related fields. Lockhart now
works full time to ensure that the Giesecke graphics series continually
applies to an evolving variety of technical disciplines.

BusinessWeek magazine, uses to create beautiful products and successful brands. (Images courtesy of
LUNAR.)
Overview
Regardless of the language they speak, people all over the world use
technical drawings to communicate their ideas. Graphic representation is a
basic, natural form of communication that isn’t tied to a particular time or
place. It is, in a sense, a universal language.
Accomplishing ideas, from the simplest to the most elaborate, requires
teamwork. A new product, machine, structure, or system may exist in the
mind of the engineer or designer, but before it can become a reality, the idea
must be communicated to many different people. The ability tocommunicate design concepts quickly and accurately through technical
drawings is key to meeting project budgets and time constraints. Effective
graphic communication is also an advantage in the global marketplace,
where team members may not always share a common language.
Like carpenters who learn to use the tools of their trade, engineers,
architects, drafters, designers, manufacturers, and technicians learn the tools
of technical drawing. They learn specific methods to represent ideas,
designs, and specifications in a consistent way that others can understand.
Being an effective graphic communicator ensures that the product, system,
or structure that you envision is produced as you specified.
Understanding the Role of Technical Drawings
Drawings and specifications control the many details of product
manufacture, assembly, and maintenance. Both ease in freehand sketching
and the ability to use computers to produce CAD models and technical
drawings are valued skills in the global marketplace. Conveying
information graphically requires knowledge of the standards that allow
drawings to concisely communicate designs around the world.
Technical drawings can take many forms: idea or concept sketches (such as
the sketches on the previous page), computation sketches, design sketches,
layout drawings, part drawings, working or construction drawings,
electrical drawings, installation drawings, and assembly drawings are allexamples. Sketches, 2D CAD drawings, and 3D CAD models are all forms
of technical drawing. Some of these types of technical drawings are shown
in Figures 1.1 through 1.3. Each of these types of drawings and others have
a place in the process of designing and building a product, system, or
structure. In general, technical drawings serve one of three purposes:
Visualization
Communication
Documentation
1.1 Computation Sketch Detail (Courtesy of Jeffrey J. Zerr.)1.2 Excerpt from an Assembly Drawing (Courtesy of Woods Power-Grip Co., Inc.)1.3 A Part Drawing (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)
A wide variety of professions use technical drawings to communicate and
document designs. Some examples are civil engineering, mechanical
engineering, electrical engineering, architecture, bio-resource engineering,
landscape design, landscape architecture, industrial design, construction
engineering, construction technology, pattern making, project management,
fabrication, and manufacturing. There are many others.
Whether you are designing a bridge, installing underground power lines in a
subdivision, or designing a plastic housing for a new toaster, understanding
and using technical drawing is a key skill you will need.
The Design Process
The organized and orderly approach to solving problems is known as the
design process. The engineering design process addresses society’s needs,
desires, and problems by applying scientific principles, experience, and
creativity.
Different types of technical drawings have a specific function in the
engineering design process. For example, freehand sketches capture and
document the ideation process. Later in the process, CAD models and
drawings capture the design and specify the details necessary for
manufacture.The design process for any product requires a clear understanding of the
functions and the performance expected of that product. The construction
project shown in Figure 1.5 is very different from the styling and functional
requirements of the products shown in Figure 1.4, but the stages in the
design process are similar for both.
1.4 These drills all perform similar functions, but a consumer’s choice of one over another may
depend on the product‘s styling and aesthetics as well as function. (©Shutterstock/Vereshchagin Dmitry.)1.5 Project engineers in hard hats examine a blueprint. (Goodluz/Shutterstock.)
It has been estimated that 70% to 80% of the cost of product development
and manufacture is determined during the initial design stages. Although
many industrial groups may identify them in their own way, one procedure
for designing a new or improved product follows the stages shown in
Figure 1.6:1.6 The Stages of the Design Process
1. Problem identification: First, a clear statement of the need for and
objectives for the design must be written.2. Ideation: Technical sketches are often used to convey concepts to
multidisciplinary teams.
3. Refinement/analysis: Designs may be rethought, based on engineering
analysis. CAD models and sketches are useful during the analysis and
compromise stage. Accurate 2D or 3D CAD models and drawings are
created to refine the design.
4. Implementation/documentation: The production and/or working
drawings that provide the details of manufacture and assembly are
finalized and approved.
Ideally, the design moves through these stages, but as new information
becomes available, it may be necessary to return to a previous stage and
repeat the process. For example, based on engineering analysis, the familiar
phrase “back to the drawing board” might come into play at the
refinement/analysis stage.
Concurrent Engineering
Traditionally, design and manufacturing activities have taken place in
sequential order rather than concurrently (simultaneously). Designers would
spend considerable effort and time analyzing components and preparing
detailed part drawings, and then forward them to other departments. For
example, the materials department would use the drawing to identify the
particular alloys and source vendors to use. The manufacturing department
would then identify the processes needed for efficient production. This step-by-step approach seems logical, but in practice it has been found to be
wasteful.
For example, if a manufacturing engineer wanted to taper the flange on a
part to make it easier to cast in metal, or to choose a different alloy, the
design analysis stage would have to be repeated to ensure that the product
would still function effectively. These iterations, illustrated in Figure 1.7a,
may be necessary, but they waste resources, and more importantly, time.
Time is important because early product introduction makes possible a
greater market percentage (and hence greater profits) and a longer life
before the product becomes obsolete (clearly a concern with products such
as consumer electronics).1.7 A Model of the Concurrent Design ProcessConcurrent engineering is a systematic approach that integrates the design
and manufacture of products with the goal of optimizing all elements
involved in the life cycle of the product. Figure 1.7b illustrates the
concurrent design process.
Life cycle design means that all aspects of a product (such as design,
development, production, distribution, use, and its ultimate disposal and
recycling) are considered simultaneously. Figure 1.8 depicts the life cycle
of a product from conception to disposal.
1.8 The Life Cycle of a ProductThe basic goals of concurrent engineering are to minimize product design
and engineering changes and to reduce the time and cost involved in taking
a product from concept through production and ultimately to the
marketplace. In concurrent engineering, all disciplines are involved in the
early design stages, so that natural iterations result in less wasted effort and
lost time.
Communication between and within disciplines is especially important in a
concurrent design process. Effective interaction among engineering,
marketing, and service functions, as well as among engineering
subdisciplines, is recognized as crucial to this type of process. Cross￾disciplinary communication also helps provide a fertile environment for
innovative approaches that can lead to savings in material and production
costs.
Computer-Aided Design and Product Development
For both large and small companies, product design often involves
preparing analytical and physical models of the product that can be used to
study factors such as forces, stresses, deflections, and optimal part shape.
The necessity for these types of models depends on how complex the
product is. Today, the process of constructing and studying analytical
models is simplified by using computer-aided design (CAD), computer￾aided engineering (CAE), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)techniques. These systems allow rapid design analysis for simple objects as
well as complex structures.
A Mechanical Engineer Working with CAD (Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock.)
CAD allows for a range of activities, from modeling 2D and 3D geometry
to creating drawings that document the design for manufacturing and legal
considerations.
CAM provides computerized control for manufacturing processes.
Examples include using a computer interface to control a lathe, or
generating the path for milling machine tools directly from the CAD model.
In more sophisticated systems, CAM can be used in materials handling,
assembly, and inspection.CAE allows users to simulate and analyze structures that will be subject to
various temperatures, static loads, or fluctuating loads. Kinematic analysis
studies moving parts. Some of these functions are integrated with CAD
software, and other packages import data from a CAD system. Using these
tools, engineers can simulate, analyze, and test designs efficiently,
accurately, and quickly.
Designing Quality into Products
Companies use a number of systematic ways to try to design “quality” into
their products as well as to measure performance and make decisions based
on data. Designers may feel that their creative approach to problem solving
is stifled when these systems are poorly implemented in the workplace; but
when these systems are well implemented, organizations can show quality
improvement.
DFSS Design for Six Sigma is an approach that uses engineering and
statistical tools to design products in a way that predicts and minimizes
customer and manufacturing problems.
Six Sigma is a process originated at Motorola to improve quality by
reducing or eliminating defects.
DMAIC Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control are steps
defined in a continuous improvement process that attempts to define and
ensure critical to function (CTF) characteristics.QFD Quality Function Deployment is a tool for decision making that helps
companies focus on a customer-driven approach and set of product
characteristics.
The Digital Database
Computer use continues to change the way products are produced. All the
information to manage, design, analyze, simulate, package, market, and
manufacture a product can be shared with a diverse (and perhaps
geographically distant) group of users through a single complex digital
database.
Product data management (PDM) systems or enterprise data management
(EDM) systems electronically store the various types of data associated
with designing and manufacturing a product. An effective PDM system
allows all the product data to be quickly stored, retrieved, displayed,
printed, managed, and transferred to anywhere in the organization. This
allows for designs to be optimized or directly modified at any time. Costs,
product revisions, and engineering change orders (ECOs) can be analyzed,
tracked, and implemented quickly. Managing enterprise data requires
commitment and planning, but companies who implement PDM effectively
can capture product data once and utilize it many ways to achieve a
competitive advantage (Figure 1.9).1.9 Product Data Management. PTC’s Windchill is an enterprise-wide product data management
system designed to be extended to serve data over the internal network (or intranet). Data from the
database are provided to external users via a secure, password-protected site (to share nonpublic
information with suppliers and other partners in remote locations). (Image courtesy of PTC, Inc. All rights

1.1 Graphics Tools in Action
Designers and engineers use graphics for visualization, communication, and
documentation throughout the design process. A case study from Santa
Cruz Bicycles will illustrate the tools used in the redesign of its V10 model,
a downhill racing mountain bike, shown in Figure 1.10.1.10 The V10 is a generation of downhill racing bikes first sold in 2002 and continually improved
based on race team results and rider feedback. The 3D model of the new design is shown here.
(Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)
Design Phase: Problem Identification
The impetus for the V10, as for most racing bikes, was higher performance.
In 2000, Santa Cruz Bicycles (SCB) purchased three patents for suspension
systems that had never been developed. Most bikes have suspension on thefront wheel; these patents showed how rear suspension could be
manipulated to improve performance and control.
The bicycle’s suspension has two roles: absorbing bumps and translating
the pulsing motion coming from the human pedaler into forward movement.
The balance between how far the wheel can move up and down and
maximal forward motion determines bike performance.
The first V10 was ridden in 2002. Its rear suspension allowed the wheel to
travel vertically 10 inches. At that time, 8–8.5 inches of travel was common
among competitors.
When SCB set out to update the V10 design, better performance was a key
criterion. The design team included the product manager (who interfaced
with marketing), two design engineers, and racers who rode the V10. The
team members had plenty of information for defining the problem: they
were familiar with the design drawings, performance specifications, and
manufacturing costs of the V10 already being produced. Racing teams
provided feedback about how the current design handled and where they
envisioned improvement. Racers and engineers viewed race videos to see
how the bike performed on courses with more or less rugged terrain.
Marketing provided information about competitors’ bikes and how the V10
measured up against them.At the problem identification stage, the team worked to enlarge the criteria
for judging the solution. The team identified three primary goals for the
redesign:
Get maximum forward movement from a suspension that also absorbs
bumps.
Improve the handling to give the rider better control.
Minimize the weight to make a lighter bike.
Spotlight
Santa Cruz Bicycles
The team at Santa Cruz Bicycles believes that to build a good bike, you
have to first really love riding bikes. They all ride daily—from the owner to
the engineers to the salespeople. This creates a very strong relationship
between the design team and their customers—each model is constantly
being refined and improved based on feedback from riders who want to—
and do—win races with a Santa Cruz bike. Their engineers are proficient
3D modelers who use the many features of Pro/ENGINEER to visualize,
analyze, and test designs before they are built. More important, the 3D
model supports the continual improvement that is built into the Santa Cruz
culture. They can quickly modify parts, see how the new part affects the
movement of the bike, assess the stresses on the new part, and send it to be
prototyped for the ultimate test: riding on unpredictable terrain.Design Phase: Ideation
The design team focused first on the geometry of how the parts of the bike
are arranged. Unlike the frame of a conventional bicycle, the V10’s frame is
in two parts. The back wheel connects to a triangular “swingarm” that
attaches to the front frame with a pivot (see Figure 1.11). The length of the
parts, the angles between them, and their movement determine how the bike
handles. In the ideation phase, the team captured and evaluated different
combinations of handlebar placements, seat, crank, pivots to the wheels and
shock absorbers, and more. How much the shock absorbers allow the wheel
to travel vertically, the pivot locations, and link sizes all affect how the bike
will perform.1.11 The V10’s rear wheel attaches to a triangular swingarm that connects to the front part of the
frame with a pivot. This allows the rear wheel to travel up and down. (Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)
At the ideation stage, being able to draw a readable freehand sketch is vital
to “selling” your idea to your design team colleagues. This stage is called
universal possibilities because the group seeks to consider every possible
solution and not limit the design by preconceived notions of what will be
best.
For each subsystem of the bike, the team generated and evaluated many
concepts. For example, they brainstormed all the ways a pivot assembly
might be made. They also employed a kind of “contest” to spur creativity
and generate options. One engineer would be given 1.5 days to come up
with a combination of parts and materials to make a subsystem, such as a
link mechanism. Then, the design tasks would be shuffled and a different
engineer would have 1.5 days to define an alternative approach to the link
mechanism. Using a whiteboard, the team would then list the pros and cons
of each subsystem design.
Design Phase: Decision Process/Design Selection
The design selection process varies by company and by the design
challenge. It may be informal and conducted by a single individual, or it
may be a highly formal process in which different teams compete for
development dollars for new products. In all cases, design selection narrows
the field of options for the final design.SCB’s team needed to evaluate how the parts would move. They created 3D
skeleton models in CAD. A skeleton model is a simplified representation of
the centerlines and other shapes that capture the design geometry. These
skeleton models are useful for kinematic analysis (Figure 1.12).1.12 Skeleton models were used for kinematic analysis of different combinations of the swingarm
geometry. The model shows how much the swingarm can pivot. (Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)
Data generated from each model showed the behavior of the suspension and
how the bike handled. Data from the kinematic analysis were captured in a
spreadsheet and used to compare the various arrangements of lengths and
angles in the designs (Figure 1.13).1.13 This graph compares the measure of rear-wheel travel produced from the skeleton model
during ideation. (Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)
Even at this early stage, drawings and models can be used to elicit customer
feedback. If the user interface is important to a product, a 3D model or a
computer simulation provides a way to get early user feedback. These
models may be shown to customers informally, or more formally through
focus groups.
At SCB, promising combinations were translated into simple prototypes
that could be used to verify the concept. Called “mules,” these proto￾bicycles were fabricated so that a human rider could evaluate the handling
(see Figure 1.14).1.14 This prototype “mule” for the V10 can be ridden and evaluated by a human rider. (Courtesy of
Santa Cruz Bicycles.)
For a new product, the design team generally prepares a product proposal to
show the management group approving new products. Drawings or
sketches are used to communicate key features of the device. Rendered
models or prototypes convey options for the final look. The proposal may
include a product plan, sales estimates, and cost figures for developing the
product. It estimates the profit to be generated by the product and describes
how it will meet the criteria for a new product, such as helping to achieve
company goals or promising the best return on investment. The ability of
the design team to communicate effectively through drawings, spreadsheets,written communication, and oral presentation all play a role in the product’s
acceptance for development.
The preliminary design selection group for the V10 consisted of design
engineers, manufacturing engineers, and the product manager. (At some
companies, the team might also include members from finance or executive
management.)
Function was the primary criterion for this review of the V10’s redesign.
Spreadsheets with data from the skeleton models, graphs comparing
different options, and measurements from the prototypes were used to make
the selection. Feedback from the riders who rode the “mules” was an
important part of the process as well.
Design Phase: Refinement
When a product is approved for further development, the team moves into
the refinement and analysis phases of the project. Because these two phases
form another “loop” in the design process, they are often combined into a
single stage called the development phase.
During the refinement stage, the product concept is solidified into an
accurate plan for making the product. Different options are evaluated in
terms of how much they will cost, how long they will take to make, how
well they satisfy the customer’s requirements, how durable they will be,
how difficult they are to assemble and service, how environmentallysustainable the design is, and so forth. At this stage members may join the
design team to provide expertise in these different areas.
At Santa Cruz Bicycles, the team had chosen a functional design and was
now ready to begin defining the part features, styling, and materials for the
bike. During refinement, the design is updated as more information is
determined about the designed components and their manufacturing
processes (see Figure 1.15).1.15 This subassembly is a combination of features that were evaluated during refinement. (Courtesy
of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)
At this point, time and money are invested in creating a model to represent
the product accurately. At Santa Cruz, two or three combinations of features
were modeled in 3D and used to analyze and test the design further.
The following were criteria at this point:
Weight: How much will a component or choice of material add to the
weight of the bike?
Strength: Can the material used to make the part stand up to the stresses
generated during a bike race?
Cost: Is a lower-cost option available? Or is the cost justified because of
what it adds to performance?
Optimization: Does the choice result in fewer parts to make or better
clearance between parts?
The team used an informal concept/criteria matrix to evaluate the options
against multiple criteria. For example, manufacturing the frame using
carbon fiber instead of aluminum would affect the cost but would decrease
the weight of the bike by 15%–17%. The matrix can tally the pluses and
minuses of various options to aid in comparing them.At Santa Cruz, bicycles are modeled in Pro/ENGINEER, a parametric solid
modeling package. Parametric or constraint-based modeling captures
relationships between part features and the sizes of the features. These
relationships capture the design intent for the part. They define features in
terms of characteristics that must be preserved when the part changes. For
example, the key design criteria for a pair of holes for mounting a bracket
might be that each be the same distance from the center of the part.
Defining the location of the holes to be half the width of the bracket from
its midline ensures that when the bracket gets wider, the holes will move
accordingly. Similarly, when a part is defined in terms of its relationship to
another part, changes in that part will cause any related parts to be updated
automatically (see Figure 1.16). This flexibility makes it easy to test many
different versions of a design—and is ideal for continually refining and
improving racing bikes like the V10.1.16 The rib shown here in red is constrained to be 10 mm back of and 12 mm down from the pivot
point. If the pivot location is changed, the rib will be updated to preserve the relationship defined by
the constraints. (Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)
Design Phase: Analysis
The analysis phase tests the design and feeds back information to refine the
design further, forming the second key iteration or “loop” in the design
process. Crucial here are the performance criteria that the design must meet.For the V10, the assembled solid model could be tested like a real bike. By
specifying the material for each part, the team assessed the total weight of
the bike as designed. Stress analysis (finite element analysis) predicted
where parts or the frame might be likely to break (see Figure 1.17). The
model was also used to evaluate the bike’s fit for riders of different sizes.
Human factors software provides a database of different body types and
sizes for this purpose. The team can simulate what an Asian female in the
50th percentile for height and weight sees while riding, what she can reach,
and the location of her center of mass. The same can be done for a white
male in the 50th percentile (see Figure 1.18).1.17 Finite element analysis can be performed within the solid modeling software, or the model can
be imported into a separate analysis package. (Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)1.18 “Mannequins” of various shapes and sizes can be added to the solid model to assess
ergonomic factors. (Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)
At this point, the model can also be used for manufacturing analysis. At
Santa Cruz, manufacturing engineers identify aspects of the design that will
be hard to manufacture: a part shape that will require special tooling or bedifficult to weld, or parts that must be made to a high degree of precision
(tolerance).
Tools that work within the solid modeling packages are available for much
of the analysis. Analysis for moving parts, such as the rear wheel
suspension, can be done in Pro/ENGINEER (and other modelers) and tested
under a wide range of physical conditions—even zero gravity! Human
factors and stress testing are two more examples of analysis that can be
done in the 3D modeler. For more advanced or specialized testing, a wide
range of software can import the 3D model data.
Whether the analysis software recommends a change or simply reports
results, it is up to the design engineer to interpret the tests and take steps to
refine and test the design further until the desired results are achieved.
Design Phase: Decision Process/Design Selection
Once a design is ready to manufacture, another design review may be
required. At each stage of the design process, more is invested in the
design, and design changes become more costly. At the ideation stage,
many ideas are investigated at relatively low cost. In the refinement stage,
more time and money are devoted to building and testing models, and the
cost of making major design changes increases. After the second design
review, companies commission molds and tooling, purchase materials, and
commit other resources to manufacturing the product. After this point,major design changes become very costly and can threaten a product’s
success. The second selection process, often called critical design review, is
a filter that allows only the products with the greatest chance of success to
proceed.
The selection team and review process may be very similar to the one that
precedes refinement, or it may involve a completely different set of criteria.
Understanding the review criteria helps you make an effective presentation
and also helps you make better design decisions in the context of your
company’s goals.
For the V10, more stakeholders evaluated the design at this point.
Representatives from marketing, sales, and graphic design were added to
the team, and the aesthetics of the design were considered (see Figure 1.19).
How will the logo fit onto the bike as designed? Which look is more
marketable? Should a straight or a curved tube be used for the swingarm?
What are the implications of the manufacturing cost for the bike’s sales
potential?1.19 Multiple options for the look of the frame triangle were considered in the final design review.

Design Phase: Implementation
During the implementation phase, the design is communicated to those
responsible for manufacturing, assembling, and distributing the product. Up
to this point, drawings and models served a variety of purposes. In the
implementation phase, they become contracts with suppliers. The model
and the accompanying drawings (if any) must clearly specify what
constitutes an acceptable part.
As in refinement, the 3D solid model serves as the information database.
Dimensioned multiview drawings may be generated directly from the solid
model. Increasingly often, manufacturing processes are directed from the
model itself, with no need for an intermediate drawing. In these cases,
tolerances may be noted in the model, or critical dimensions and tolerances
marked on a drawing may be sufficient.
Tooling for a bicycle’s design can cost as much as $120,000, so care is
taken to be sure that the tools are correct. SCB uses a detailed checklist to
ensure that they are ready to have the tools made for manufacturing the
bicycle. Because the 3D model is used to communicate the design to the
toolmakers, it is sent to them for review and analysis before the final design
is documented.Sample parts are requested so that the physical parts can be measured
against the model and tested to see how they fit together. Mechanical
testing, ride testing, and destructive testing are done on the sample parts
while there is still time to make a change to alleviate problems (see Figure
1.20). Once engineering is satisfied with parts as manufactured, the models
for the design are approved.
1.20 This sample part for the swingarm failed during testing. (Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)
Although the design has been finalized, there still may be changes during
the implementation phase (as well as later when the product is inproduction). With rapid prototyping and design simulations using the solid
model, it is easier and more cost effective to anticipate these issues in the
refinement stage, but it is not uncommon for fine-tuning to occur during
implementation. Unavailable parts or materials can force a substitution, a
supplier may recommend a cheaper alternative, standard parts may be
substituted for newly designed ones, or unanticipated problems may crop up
during assembly. Sustainability issues can affect a design throughout the
lifetime of the product.
Assembly drawings may be generated to document the parts included in an
assembly and to illustrate how they fit together. The parts list, or bill of
materials, is an important facet of inventory planning and assembly. Parts
from the solid model may be catalogued in a company-wide parts database.
Parts in the database can be reused or shared by other products, and
standard parts inventories can be tracked and monitored.
Design Phase: Documentation
The documentation phase of the design process captures the final design
and freezes it. Each company has its own procedures for managing models
and controlling changes to the model database, but it must create permanent
records for archival purposes, patent applications, and other legal uses (see
Figure 1.21).1.21 This drawing generated from the solid model includes notes that call attention to the fit with
other parts that the V10’s frame must achieve. (Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)
At Santa Cruz Bicycles, the 3D model is archived at each stage of the
process. The model is sufficiently documented so that no 2D drawings are
needed. Occasionally, a 2D drawing generated from the model is used to
call a toolmaker’s attention to a key dimension or tolerance.
Sometimes, after a model is sent to the manufacturer, dimensioned
drawings are prepared to document the final product as manufactured and
assembled. Measurements are taken from the actual parts, and the solid
model is modified to match them, then dimensioned drawings from the final
model are stored in the archive. (This is the reverse of the traditional model,in which the documentation drawings are prepared first to transmit the
design to manufacturing.)
The 3D design database (solid model) may be archived as the permanent
record. Fully dimensioned engineering drawings also may be used to
provide a permanent record of the design at some point. Companies that use
the model for documentation have well-defined procedures for archiving
the final model. Because files stored in electronic format can be altered so
that they no longer represent the actual product design, companies must
control access to the information in the solid model—or capture it in
another medium—to create a permanent record. Once a model has been
archived, only authorized personnel may make changes to it.
The solid model can also be used to generate a wide range of graphics used
to document a product or process. Views of the model are imported into
step-by-step illustrated guides for assembly line personnel (Figure 1.22),
and the same guides are sent to service personnel who need to disassemble
and reassemble the products after sale.1.22 Exploded views such as this one can be used to illustrate assembly or service manuals for the
V10. (Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)
1.2 Rapid Prototyping
While refining design ideas, the design team often works concurrently with
manufacturing to determine the best ways to make and assemble the
necessary parts. After several cycles of refining, analyzing, and
synthesizing the best ideas, rapid prototyping systems allow designers to
generate parts quickly, directly from 3D models, for mockup and testing.
For example, they can check usability for humans or explore customer
reactions in consumer focus groups by showing them facsimile productscreated using rapid prototyping. 3D design data can be formatted for use by
rapid prototyping equipment. Figure 1.23 shows the prototyped part
emerging from the unfused material of the rapid prototyper, which can
“print” a color part like the one shown in about four hours. You will learn
more about rapid prototyping in Chapter 10.1.23 Rapid Prototyping. The ZPrinter 450 “printed” the colored part shown in about four hours.

1.3 Drafting Standards
There are standards that support a uniform, effective graphic language for
use in industry, manufacturing, engineering, and science. Technical drawing
texts like this book can help you learn them. In the United States, providing
these standards has been the work of the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) with the American Society for Engineering Education
(ASEE), the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), and the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).
Participants in these organizations help develop the American National
Standard Drafting Manual—Y14, which is composed of a number of
separate sections that are published as approved standards as they are
completed. These standards are frequently updated to communicate
information so that it meets the needs of modern industry and engineering
practice. They are considered the most authoritative guide to uniform
drafting practices in the United States today.
International standards, often defined by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), and the ASME or ANSI standards for drawing
practices are similar in many respects. The greatest differences are in the
preferred method of projection: first-angle versus third-angle projection,
and in the units of measurement in dimensioning. Third-angle projection isthe projection method that you will be learning in this text. Where practical,
information for both U.S. and international drawings will be presented.
1.4 Creativity Techniques
Some people are naturally gifted at design and drawing, but all persons can
improve their design ability if they learn to use the proper tools and
techniques. It is similar to learning to play a musical instrument; it comes
more naturally to some people than to others, but all can learn to play if
they practice.
How do you develop new ideas? Here are some proven techniques you can
practice.
Examine Manufactured Products
It is common for design engineers to dismantle manufactured products,
evaluate them, and study how their parts are designed to work together. As
you use and examine manufactured products, ask yourself, How could they
be improved? What would you do differently? How could you
expand/change the design to guarantee better performance? What could you
do to expand the life of the product? How could you make it more efficient,
more cost-effective, and so forth?
Reverse engineering is a term that refers to designing products based on
existing designs, usually through measurement and deconstruction of anexisting product. A coordinate measuring machine (CMM) aids in
speeding the time to reverse engineer some products. A CMM measures the
object using a probe or laser and stores the pertinent geometric information
into a database where it can be manipulated using CAD.
Functional decomposition is a term for determining the subfunctions
involved in a design and then using those functions to reconstruct a similar
product.

Study the Natural WorldNoting how other creatures and organisms function and interact with their
surroundings can provide a wealth of information and creativity. Such
things as beehives and spiderwebs are masterpieces of structural design that
have inspired human designers for centuries. A hummingbird’s wings are
aerodynamic wonders. There is much to be learned by studying natural
forms and expanding on their designs, as Leonardo da Vinci did with his
flying machine (Figure 1.24).

Vinci (Leo Blanchette/Shutterstock.)
Watch the Web
Excellent resources for engineering and design are available on the World
Wide Web. Reading technology blogs and news feeds and visitingengineering sites is a way to stay current and keep in touch with peers. The
following websites are useful for engineering design:
www.uspto.gov (U.S. Patent Office online search site)

www.engineeringtoolbox.com
www.engnetglobal.com
www.efunda.com
www.thomasnet.com

www.howstuffworks.com
Research Patent Drawings
Patents can be a great source of ideas. A patent is issued by the U.S.
government and grants the holder the “right to exclude others from making,
using, or selling” a specific product for a specific time period. The patent
process was first developed as a way to promote the disclosure of technical
advances. You can research the current state of design for your product idea
at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s searchable website
(www.uspto.gov). The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has strict
regulations as to how designs are presented in patent drawings to ensure
that the drawings are easy to reproduce (Figure 1.25).1.25 Patent Drawing for a Healthier Helmet
Design GroupsTo bring complex products and systems to market, most individuals end up
working in a team environment. Teams combine the expertise of individuals
familiar with materials, production processes, marketing, finance, and so
on, so most projects become a team effort long before a product is produced
and marketed. In addition to supplying the varied expertise that it takes to
bring an idea from concept to manufacture, interaction between people of
varied talents plays an important role in the creative design process. The
ability to create and understand technical drawings helps group members
contribute to and benefit from team communication.
1.5 Product Definition
As stated before, technical graphics play three important roles:
visualization, communication, and documentation. Drawings and CAD
models are an important part of product definition. Product definition
refers to the collection of digital or hard copy documents that specify the
physical and functional requirements for a product. These can range from a
3D CAD model that specifies manufacturing requirements within the CAD
file to a dimensioned paper sketch.
Many companies prefer storing information in a digital format because the
storage cost is comparatively low and the data can be easily searched,
retrieved, and utilized by many individuals. Figure 1.26 represents the range
of contents in a product definition data set. A thorough understanding of thegraphic language, from hand sketches to complex 3D models, is necessary
to be a player in the competitive world marketplace.

1.6 Showing the Design Process in a Portfolio
A portfolio is a representative sample of work that helps communicate your
skills and talents, usually to a prospective employer or client. Many
companies and individuals post portfolios on the Web to promote their
capabilities and accomplishments. Larger companies tend to show more
models and completed projects because working drawings may be
proprietary information. Individuals, particularly recent students, may focusmore on showing correct drawing practices and creative problem-solving
skills.
Whether you are a consulting engineer, an architect, an industrial designer,
or a draftsman, showing samples of your work offers an advantage over just
talking about it. Drawings are proof that you not only have good ideas but
also have the skill to communicate clearly and accurately throughout the
stages of a project, from concept to completion.
If you are seeking an entry-level job, don’t worry if your portfolio looks
like an entry-level portfolio. Clean, correct student work is a good
indication of your potential. Don’t try to cover a lack of well-drawn
examples with a more expensive portfolio case, or decorative presentation.
Instead, spend that energy completing a project that shows your ability.
A portfolio is an opportunity to tell concise success stories. For example,
you may want to show four to six projects, including the design brief (or
assigned problem), sketches, development drawings, and final presentation
(including working drawings, renderings, and physical or 3D models) for
each. Your portfolio samples make great talking points in an interview, so
take advantage of the chance to show how you tackled challenges such as
cutting costs, improving function, or solving problems that arose along the
way.
Some more tips for creating a successful portfolio are:1. Less is more. Others will assume that your portfolio is your best work,
so a few good examples are better than a million mediocre examples.
Four to six projects are usually plenty.
2. Show correct drawing practices. Especially if you are seeking a drafting
position, but even if your strength is creativity, be sure that lineweights,
dimensioning, notes, and other parts of the drawing conform to technical
drawing standards.
3. Keep several versions of your current portfolio, including hard copy,
digital, and Web presence. Use widely accessible formats (such as PDF
or PowerPoint) to make your digital portfolio easy to access. Including
your Web address in correspondence allows people to view your work or
refer to your samples at their convenience.
4. Never rely entirely on electronic equipment. Even if you have a great
digital presentation, bring a portfolio of printed samples. Drawings
should be clean and legible. Depending on your discipline, you may
want a larger or smaller portfolio case, keeping in mind how convenient
it is to transport and view. You may fold large drawings to fit, as long as
they are easy to take out and look at.
5. Save good examples as you create them. It is easy to forget what you did
last year, or four years ago. Keep copies (both digital and paper) of your
best work in a file for portfolio samples and remember to save some
development sketches from successful projects, too.
6. Depending on your career goals, let your portfolio reflect the area you
want to explore. If you are seeking a creative position and you haverelated skills (such as artistic drawing or photography) you may want to
include appropriate examples. If you are mainly interested in a drafting
position, you may want to include more working drawings and models.
Throughout this book, the Portfolio sections give you some exposure to
real-world drawings that apply to chapter topics. However, the Portfolio
section in this chapter shows how an industrial design student successfully
communicated the design process through a well-conceived portfolio page.
PortfolioThis single page from the portfolio of John Mountz begins with the design brief and rationale for the
design. It includes initial concepts, more refined sketches, a solid model, and details. Mountz showed
the final presentation drawing on an additional portfolio page. At the time, he was a student ofindustrial designer Doug Wintin, then Chair of the School of Design at ITT Technical Institute.

Chapter Summary
The graphic language is the universal language used to design, develop,
and construct products and systems throughout the world.
The design process combines ideas, scientific principles, resources, and
existing products into a solution for a problem. It consists of five specific
stages.
Every technical drawing is based on standards that prescribe what each
symbol, line, and arc means.
The members of a engineering design project team must be able to
communicate among themselves and with the rest of the project team to
contribute to the team’s success.
The basic principles for communicating information using technical
drawings are the same whether drawings are created by hand or using
CAD.Successful companies hire skilled people who can add value to their
team. A thorough understanding of the graphic language is an essential
skill that employers value.

Can Opener Project
In this ongoing project, you will reverse engineer an Amco Swing-A-Way
407WH Portable Can Opener. It is recommended you purchase a readily
available and affordable product similar to this one, so you can make
measurements directly when required. This effective and low-cost canopener seems simple in its familiarity, but it is clear when you begin to take
one apart that considerable effort went into designing a product that is
inexpensive, reliable, and easy to operate for most people.

the temperature at which the measurements are taken
how stationary the part is while being measured
the accuracy of the measurement device

Layouts and Lettering
Objectives
After studying the material in this chapter, you should be able to:
1. Identify six types of technical drawings based on the projection system
they use.
2. Identify the line patterns used in technical drawings and describe how
they are used.
3. Identify standard drawing media and sheet sizes.
4. Label drawing scale information.
5. Add lettering to a sketch.
6. Fill in a standard title block with the appropriate information.
7. Lay out a drawing sheet.
Refer to the following standards:
ANSI/ASME Y14.100 Engineering Drawing Practices
ANSI/ASME Y14.2 Line Conventions and Lettering
ANSI/ASME Y14.1 Drawing Sheet Size and FormatLayout with Title Block of a Small Part at Scale 1:1 (Courtesy Dynojet Research, Inc.)
Overview
Two-dimensional technical drawings, whether they are sketched by hand,
drawn using instruments, drawn using a CAD program, or generated from
3D solid models, follow certain rules so that they can be correctly
interpreted. Unlike artistic drawings, which communicate self-expression
and emotional content, technical drawings communicate size, shape, andfeature information about a product, system, or device. To clearly describe
this information, technical drawings adhere closely to formal standards.
These formal standards include systems of projection for developing and
understanding drawing views. They also include an “alphabet of lines,” in
which each line of the drawing represents certain information. Lettering is
also standardized, to make drawings quick to create and easy to read and
reproduce. Standard sheet sizes for drawings include a title block that
provides important information such as the drawing name, company
information, scale, revision numbers, and approvals for release of the
drawing.
Understanding Projection
Behind every 2D drawing of an object is a space relationship involving the
object and three “imagined” things:
1. The observer’s eye, or station point
2. The plane of projection
3. The projectors (also called visual rays or lines of sight)
Figure 2.1 shows two drawings of a shape projected onto a plane as viewed
by an observer, whose eye represents the station point. The lines projecting
from the corners (or vertices) of the object are the imagined lines, called
projectors.2.1 The Concept of Projection
To understand projection, imagine that the drawing is produced by points,
called piercing points, where the projectors would pierce the projection
plane. The drawing may be a two-dimensional representation on a sheet ofpaper, or it may be a two-dimensional representation shown on your
computer screen, as shown in Figure 2.2, but the basic principles are the
same. One reason 2D projection skills remain relevant, even with the advent
of 3D modeling, is that computer monitors still display a 2D view on their
flat screens.
2.2 A View of a 3D Object “Projected” onto a Computer Monitor
Types of Projection
There are two main types of projection: perspective and parallel. These are
broken down into subtypes, as shown in Figure 2.3.2.3 Classification of Projections
In perspective projections, the projectors come together at the station point
to form a cone, as in Figure 2.1a. Perspective drawings represent objects as
we see them or as they would appear in a photograph.
In parallel projections, the projectors are parallel, as shown in Figure 2.1b.Orthographic projections are one type of parallel projection. In
orthographic (meaning right-angle) projections, the parallel projectors are
perpendicular to the plane of projection. Because orthographic projections
show objects in a way that their features can be represented at true size or
scaled at a proportion of true size, they are especially useful in specifying
the dimensions needed in technical applications.
If the projectors are parallel to each other, but are at an angle other than 90°
to the plane of projection, the result is called an oblique projection.
Technical drawings of 3D objects usually use one of four standard types of
projection, shown in Figure 2.3:
Multiview
Axonometric (includes isometric)
Oblique
Perspective
Multiview projection shows one or more necessary views. Either of two
systems is used to arrange the views in a multiview drawing: third-angle or
first-angle. You will learn about multiview projection in Chapter 6.
Axonometric, oblique, and perspective sketches are methods of showing the
object pictorially in a single view. They will be discussed in Chapter 3.
The main types of projection are listed in Table 2.1.Table 2.1 Classification by Projectors

Drawing lines, lettering, measurement systems, scale, sheet sizes, and title
blocks are presented in this chapter.
Drawing Lines Projected drawing views use specific line patterns to
represent object features. For example, when showing a 3D object, some
lines represent the edges of surfaces that are hidden from that viewing
direction. These hidden lines have a dashed line pattern to help the reader
understand the drawing. Another type of line indicates the location of the
center of a symmetrical feature, such as a hole. Familiarity with the types of
lines used in technical drawings helps you read drawings and create
drawings that others can easily understand.
Lettering The shapes of letters that are easy to read and write are described
as part of drawing standards. Often, freehand sketching is used early in the
design process to present ideas. Showing notes and information legibly
helps present your ideas to others clearly. Good lettering often makes or
breaks a sketch.
Measurement Systems Two measurement systems are used for technical
drawings: the metric system and U.S. customary units. It is important to be
familiar with both measurement systems to create and read drawings that
are used worldwide.Scale Obviously, a large item (a house or bridge for example) cannot be
shown full size on a paper sheet. To clearly convey important information
about particularly large or small objects, you need to select an appropriate
sheet size and show drawings to scale (proportionately smaller or larger
than the actual size). Standard lettering sizes for drawings depend on the
sheet size.
Title Blocks Company information, the drawing scale, sheet size, and other
information is included in a standard title block located in the lower right
corner of the drawing to make it easy to locate these important details on
every drawing layout.
2.1 Alphabet of Lines
The meaning of each line on a technical drawing is indicated by its width
(thick or thin) and its particular line style. The person who reads the
drawing will depend on these line styles to know if a line is visible or
hidden, if it represents a center axis, or if it conveys dimension information.
To make your drawings easy to read, make the contrast between thick and
thin lines distinct. Thick lines (0.6 mm) should be twice the width of thin
lines (0.3 mm), as shown in Figure 2.4. The line gage in Figure 2.5 shows
various widths.2.4 Thick and Thin Drawing Lines
2.5 Line Gage
Figure 2.6 shows freehand line technique. You may find it helpful to use 
1/8
′′
 graph paper at first to get a feel for the length of dashes used in hidden
lines and centerlines. Soon you will be able to estimate the lengths by eye.2.6 Good and Poor Freehand Line Technique
Figure 2.7 illustrates line styles for technical drawings. All lines (except
construction lines) must be sharp and dark. For visible, cutting-plane, and
short-break lines use thick lines. Thin drawing lines should be just as sharp
and black, but only half the thickness of thick lines. Construction lines and
lettering guidelines should be thin and light so that they can barely be seen
at arm’s length and need not be erased. All lines should be uniform in width
and darkness. Ideal lengths of the dashes used to form the line patterns are
also shown in Figure 2.7.2.7 Alphabet of Lines (Full Size)
2.2 Freehand Lines
The main difference between an instrument or CAD drawing and a freehand
sketch is in the appearance of the lines. A good freehand line is not
expected to be precisely straight or exactly uniform, as is a CAD or
instrument-drawn line. Freehand lines show freedom and variety. Freehand
construction lines are very light, rough lines. All other lines should be dark
and clean.
2.3 Measurement Systems
When you create a technical drawing, the item you show will be
manufactured or constructed using a particular system of measurement,which you indicate on the drawing. The metric system is the world standard
used for measuring lengths.
U.S. Customary Units
U.S. customary units based on inch-foot and yard measurements (where
there are 3 feet to the yard, and 12 inches to the foot; a yard equals exactly
0.9144 meter) continue to be used in the United States. Drawings may use
either measurement system and still follow ANSI/ASME drawing standards
as long as the system of measurement is stated clearly on the drawing.
Figures 2.8 and 2.9 show the same part dimensioned with the two different
measurement systems.
2.8 A Drawing Dimensioned Using Metric Units2.9 A Drawing Dimensioned Using U.S. Customary Units
The Metric System
Today’s metric system is the International System of Units, commonly
referred to as SI (from the French name, le Système International d’Unités).
It was established in 1960 by international agreement and is now the
international standard of measurement, with all countries in the world
adopting it, although some continue using traditional U.S. units to a greater
or lesser degree.
The meter was established by the French in 1791 as the length of one ten￾millionth of the distance from the Earth’s equator to the pole along the
meridian that, coincidentally, passes through Paris. Since then the definition
has been updated to be the distance that light travels in a vacuum in
1/299,792,458 of a second. A meter equals 39.37 inches or approximately
1.1 yards.The metric system for linear measurement is a decimal system similar to the
U.S. system of counting money. For example,
The primary unit of measurement for engineering drawings and design in
the mechanical industries is the millimeter (mm). Secondary units of
measure are the meter (m) and the kilometer (km). The centimeter (cm) and
the decimeter (dm) are rarely used on drawings.
Some industries have used a dual dimensioning system of millimeters and
inches on drawings. However, this practice can be confusing because the
sizes displayed in the two systems may contain rounding errors. If two
systems are shown, the primary units are used for all manufacturing
measurements, and the secondary system units (shown in parentheses or
brackets) are for general information purposes only. Figure 2.10 shows a
drawing using dual dimensioning. Most large manufacturers use all metric
dimensions on the drawing for ease and consistency.
1 mm = 1 millimeter (1/1000 of ameter)
1 cm = 1 centimeter (1/100 ofameter)
= 10 mm
1 dm = 1 decimeter (1/10 ofameter)
= 10 cm = 100 mm
1 m = 1 meter
= 100 cm = 1000 mm
1 km = 1 kilometer = 1000 m
= 100,000 cm = 1,000,000 mm2.10 A Dual-Dimensioned Drawing Using U.S. Customary Units as the Primary Units
Dimensions that are given in U.S. customary units (inches and feet, either
decimal or fractional) can be converted easily to metric values. In standard
practice, the ratio 1in. = 25.4mm is used. Decimal-equivalents tables can
be found inside the back cover of this book. Many handy unit conversion
sites are also available on the Web at sites such as
www.onlineconversion.com.
2.4 Drawing Scale
Unlike a computer drawing (where an object is drawn actual size so that the
information stored in the computer file is accurate), a printed or paper
drawing may represent the object at its actual size (full size) or may be
larger or smaller than the object, depending on the size of sheet used.Drawing scale is the reduction or enlargement of the drawn object relative
to the real object (Figure 2.11).
2.11 Reduced and Enlarged Scale. Many drawings must be shown at reduced scale for the object to
fit on the paper.
Scale is stated as a ratio of the number of drawing units to the number of
actual units. For example, a machine part may be shown on a sheet at half
its actual size, a scale of 1:2; a building may be drawn 1/48 of its size, a
scale of 1:48 (or in U.S. customary units, 1/4
′′ = 1′); a map may be drawn
1/1200 actual size, a scale of 1′′= 100′ or 1:1200; or a printed circuit board
may be drawn four times its size, a scale of 4:1.
2.5 Specifying the Scale on a Drawing
There are several acceptable methods of noting scale on the drawing, but all
of them show the relationship of the size of the object as drawn to the size
of the actual object. For a part that is shown on the paper at half its actual
size, the scale is listed in one of these three ways:
SCALE: 1:2SCALE: 1/2
SCALE: .5
For machine drawings, the scale indicates the ratio of the size of the drawn
object to its actual size, regardless of the unit of measurement used.
Expansion or enlargement scales are given as 2:1, 4:1; 5:1, 10:1, and so on.
Figure 2.11 illustrates how the actual object relates to a drawing at half size
and how that might be noted in the title block of the drawing. Figure 2.12
shows the scale for a 1 to 24 reduction noted in a title block.
2.12 List the predominant drawing scale in the title block. (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)
Architectural drawings in the United States typically list the scale based on
the number of fractions of an inch on the drawing that represent one foot on
the actual object. For example, SCALE: 1/8
′′ = 1′.The various scale calibrations available on the metric scale and the
engineers’ scale provide almost unlimited scale ratios. Preferred metric
scale ratios are 1:1; 1:2; 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:50, 1:100, and 1:200.
Map scales are indicated in terms of proportions such as Scale 1:62500,
fractions such as Scale 1/62500, or graphically, such as: 
Step by Step
Using a Measuring Scale to Lay Out a One-Fiftieth Size Metric Drawing Determine the full-size measurements of the object you will draw.
This example will lay out a 3500 × 2500 − mm flat plate with a
rectangular slot in it. A picture of the part to be drawn with dimensions
representing its actual size is shown above.
 Many measuring scales are available that use standard drawing
scales, like this 1:50 ratio metric one.
 Starting from the 0 end of the 1:50 scale, use a sharp pencil to make a
thin, light, short line to mark off the length of the 3500-mm line. To make
accurate measurements, be sure to place the scale edge parallel to the line
you are measuring on the drawing, and make your dashes at right angles to
the scale, at the correct graduation mark, as shown. Check the length of your scaled line by calculating how many
millimeters the length should be, then measuring the line you have drawn
with a full-scale metric scale. In this case the 3500-mm length should be 70
mm when shown at 1:50 scale. Continue to lay out the remaining lengths. Even slight errors in
measurements when using a scale may accumulate to produce a significant
error, so work carefully.
To avoid cumulative errors, instead of setting off distances individually by
moving the scale to a new position each time, position the scale once and
mark all of the distances by adding each successive measurement to the
preceding one.
This is useful in dimensioning drawings, too. Keep in mind that providing
dimensions from one end to each successive location (say, in the case ofbuilding a wall) makes it easier for the worker to lay it out quickly and
accurately.
For more about the use of measuring scales, see Appendix 34 (online).
Step by Step
Measuring with with an Architects’ Scale
 To make measurements with an architects’ scale, first determine
which scale to use by reading the scale noted in the title block or noted
below the view. In the example above, 3/8inch = 1 foot. Position the scale so that the 0 value is aligned with the left end of the
line being measured and note the division mark nearest to the line’s right
end (in this case, 2). Slide the scale to the right so that the closest whole division you
noted in Step 2 lines up with the right end of the line you are measuring.
A fractional portion of the line you are measuring now extends on the left,
past the scale’s 0 mark.Counting toward the left, note how many fractional division marks are
between zero and the left end of the line. (In this example, there are two.)
Add the fractional value to the whole value that you noted in Step 2. In this
example, you noted two whole division lines, plus two fractional division
lines, so the length of the line is 2′−2′′ at actual size.
*On architects’ scales, there are 12 fractional divisions because there are
12 inches per foot.
For more about the use of measuring scales, see Appendix 34 (online).2.6 Lettering
Lettered text is often necessary to completely describe an object or to
provide detailed specifications. Lettering should be legible, be easy to
create, and use styles acceptable for traditional drawing and CAD drawing.
Engineering drawings use single-stroke sans serif letters because they are
highly legible and quick to draw. (Sans serif means without serifs, or spurs.)
The sans serif letters used for drawings are also referred to as Gothic. (Serif
letters are sometimes called Roman, but today that term is commonly used
for the upright form of the letters.) A font is the name for a set of letters
with the same style. Figure 2.13 shows the distinctions among Roman,
italic, serif, and sans serif fonts.2.13 Distinctions Among Letter Forms
Lettering is a standard feature available in computer graphics programs.
With CAD software, you can add titles, notes, and dimensioning
information to a drawing. Several fonts and a variety of sizes may beselected. When modifications are required, it is easy to make lettering
changes on the drawing by editing existing text.
Freehand lettering ability has little relationship to writing ability. You can
learn to letter neatly even if you have terrible handwriting. There are three
necessary aspects of learning to letter:
Knowing the proportions and forms of the letters (to make good letters,
you need to have a clear mental image of their correct shape)
Spacing of letters and words for legibility
Practice
2.7 Lettering Standards
Most hand-drawn notes use lettering about 3 mm (1/8
′′
) high. Light
horizontal guidelines are useful for producing consistent letter heights.
CAD notes are set using the keyboard and sized to be in the range of 3 mm 
(1/8
′′
) tall according to the plotted size of the drawing. Lettering heights
vary with the size of the sheet and the intended use of the drawing.
CAD drawings typically use a Gothic (sans serif) lettering style but often
use a Roman (serif) style for titles. When adding lettering to a CAD
drawing, a good rule of thumb is not to use more than two fonts within the
same drawing. See Figure 2.14 for a sample of the fonts available using
CAD. You may want to use one font for the titles and a different font for
notes and other text. Keep in mind that if you open a drawing created withsoftware such as AutoCAD, you must have the fonts available that were
used in the drawing, otherwise the software will have to substitute different
fonts. This can be a problem because the horizontal spacing may be
different and the text will no longer fit correctly. It may be tempting to use
many different fonts in a drawing because of the wide variety available, but
this tends to look distracting on the drawing. Drawings that use too many
lettering styles and sizes have been jokingly referred to as having a “ransom
note” lettering style.
2.14 Examples of Lettering Using CAD
2.8 Using Guidelines for Hand Lettering
Use extremely light horizontal guidelines to keep letter height uniform, as
shown in Figure 2.15. Capital letters are commonly made 3 mm (1/8′′)
high, with the space between rows of lettering being from three-fifths to fullheight of the letters. Do not use vertical guidelines to space the distance
from one letter to the next within a word or sentence. This should be done
by eye while lettering. If necessary, use a vertical guideline at the beginning
of a column of hand-lettered text to help you line up the left edges of the
following rows. Beginners can also use randomly spaced vertical guidelines
to practice maintaining the correct slant.
2.15 Using Guidelines
2.9 Vertical and Inclined Letters and Numerals
The proportions of vertical capital letters and numbers are shown in Figure
2.16. The letter shapes are probably a little wider than your usual writing.
Hand lettering and text added to engineering drawings is typically upper
case. Lowercase letters are rarely used except for large volumes of notes or
when there is some other particular need for it. Lowercase letters are shown
in Figure 2.17. The lower part of the letter (or descender) is usually two
thirds the height of the capital letter.2.16 Vertical Capital Letters and Numerals2.17 Vertical Lowercase Letters
Inclined (italic) capital letters and numerals are shown in Figure 2.18. They
are similar to vertical lettering, except the slope is about 68° from the
horizontal. Although you may practice hand lettering slanted at
approximately this angle, it is important in CAD drawings to always set the
amount of incline for the letters at the same value within a drawing so that
the lettering is consistent. Inclined lowercase letters, shown in Figure 2.19,
are rarely used.2.18 Inclined Capital Letters and Numerals
2.19 Inclined Lowercase LettersKeep in mind that only one style of lettering or font, either vertical or
inclined, should be used throughout a drawing.
Tip
For Even Freehand Letters
Use 1/8
′′
 gridded paper for drawing to make lettering easy.
Use a scale and set off a series of spaces, making both the letters and the
spaces between lines of letters 1/8
′′
 high.
Use a guideline template like the Berol Rapidesign 925 shown in Figure
2.20.
2.20 The Berol Rapidesign 925 template is used to create guidelines quickly for lettering.
For whole numbers and fractions, draw five equally spaced guidelines.2.10 Fractions
Fractions are shown twice the height of the corresponding whole numbers.
Make the numerator and the denominator each about three-fourths as high
as the whole number to allow enough space between them and the fraction
bar. For dimensioning, the most commonly used height for whole numbers
is 3 mm (1/8′′), and for fractions 6 mm (1/4′′), as shown in Figure 2.21.
2.21 Common Errors in Lettering Fractions
Never let numerals touch the fraction bar.
Center the denominator under the numerator.
Avoid using an inclined fraction bar, except when lettering in a narrow
space, as in a parts list.
Make the fraction bar slightly longer than the widest part of the fraction.
Dimensioning in fractions is still used in the US, but even there it is less
and less common. Calculating with fractions often takes manufacturing
workers extra time and errors are common. Much of the numerically￾controlled manufacturing for cabinets and countertops uses millimeters as
the default units, even in the United States.2.22 Custom Cabinetry Dimensioned in Fractional Inches (Courtesy of Centermark Industries, Inc.)
2.11 Spacing of Letters and Words
Spacing between Letters
Uniform spacing between letters is done by eye. Contrary to what might
seem logical, putting equal distances from letter to letter causes them to
appear unequally spaced. The background areas between letters, not the
distances between them, should be approximately equal to get results thatappear balanced. Figure 2.23 illustrates how using equal spacing from one
letter to the next does not actually appear equal. Space your lettering so that
background areas appear equal, like the example shown in the bottom half
of the figure.
2.23 Visually Balancing Letter Spacing
Some combinations, such as LT and VA, may have to be slightly closer than
other letters to look correctly spaced. In some cases, the width of a letter
may be decreased slightly. For example, the lower stroke of the L may be
shortened when followed by A. In typesetting, pairs of letters that need to
be spaced more closely to appear correctly are called kerned pairs.Spacing between Words
Space letters closely within words to make each word a compact unit, but
space words well enough apart to clearly separate them from adjacent
words. For both uppercase and lowercase lettering, make spaces between
words approximately equal to a capital O.
Spacing between Rows
Be sure to leave space between rows of lettering, usually equal to the letter
height. Rows spaced too closely are hard to read. Rows spaced too far apart
do not appear to be related.
Tip
Creating Letters that Appear Stable
Certain letters and numerals appear top-heavy when they are drawn with
equal upper and lower portions as in the example below.
To correct this, reduce the size of the upper portion to give a balanced
appearance, as in the example below.
If you put the central horizontal strokes of the letters B, E, F, and H at
midheight, they will appear to be below center.To overcome this optical illusion, draw the strokes for B, E, F, and H
slightly above the center as you letter, keeping letters uniform, as in the
second example below.
The same practice applies to numerals. In the illustrations below, the
example at left looks top-heavy. Note how the example at right looks more
balanced.2.12 Lettering for TitlesIn most cases, the title and related information are lettered in title boxes or
title strips as shown in Figure 2.24. The main drawing title is usually
centered in a rectangular space, which is easy to do using CAD.
2.24 Balanced Machine-Drawing Title
In any kind of title, give the most important words prominence by making
the lettering larger, heavier, or both. Other data, such as scale and date, can
be smaller. One technique for centering words in the title block when hand
lettering is to roughly letter the words on a scrap of paper, slide it in the
available space, and make a light mark to indicate where to begin lettering
the title (Figure 2.25).2.25 Centering Title in Title Box
Figure 2.26 shows examples of freehand lettering at actual size.
2.26 Pencil Lettering (Full Size)
Tip
Lettering with a Pencil
Because practically all pencil lettering will be reproduced, the letters
should be dense black, not gray or blurred. Use a sharp, soft pencil, such
as an F, H, or HB to make lettering dark and sharp.
If you like using wooden pencils, sharpen them to a needle point, then
dull the point very slightly.
Don’t worry about making the exact letter strokes unless you find it
difficult to make the letters look right, but do use them as a reference if
you are having trouble drawing uniform, symmetrical letters.
Use extremely light, 1/8” (3 mm) horizontal guidelines to regulate the
height of letters. A few light vertical or inclined lines randomly placedhelp you visually keep the letters uniformly vertical or inclined.
Draw vertical strokes downward with a finger movement.
Draw horizontal strokes from left to right with a wrist movement and
without turning the paper.
Draw curved strokes and inclined strokes with a downward motion.
Left-handers: Traditional lettering strokes were designed for right-handed
people. Experiment with each letter to develop a system of strokes that
works best for you.2.13 Drawing Pencils
High-quality drawing pencils help produce good-quality technical sketches
and drawings. Use light lines for construction lines, lettering guidelines, and
precise layout work. Use dark, dense black lines for the final lines, lettering,
and arrowheads. Drawings are often reproduced, and the lines need to be
dark for the copies to turn out well.
Drawing pencils are made of graphite with a polymer binder or clay binder.
They are divided into 18 grades from 9H (the hardest) to 7B (the softest) as
shown in Figure 2.27. Specially formulated leads of carbon black particles
in a polymer binder are also available in several grades for use on polyester
film (Mylar).2.27 Lead Grade Chart
Hard leads are used where accuracy is required, such as on graphical
computations and charts and diagrams. For other uses, their lines are apt to
be too light.
Medium leads are used for general-purpose technical drawing, such as
sketching, lettering, arrowheads, and other freehand work on mechanical
drawings.
Soft leads are not useful in technical drawing. They make smudged, rough
lines that are hard to erase, and the lead dulls quickly. These grades are
generally used for artistic drawing.Which grade of pencil works best for you depends on your hand pressure,
the humidity, and the type of paper you are using, among other things. For
light lines, use a hard lead in the range of 4H to 6H. For dark lines, use a
softer lead in the range of 2H to B.
Mechanical pencils are available with 0.3-, 0.5-, 0.7-, or 0.9-mm-diameter
drafting leads in several grades (Figure 2.28). Their thin leads produce
uniform-width lines without sharpening. The .5-mm lead is a good general
size, or you can use a .7-mm lead for thick lines and .3 mm for thin lines.
2.28 Drawing Pencils
TipYou might be surprised how much your drawings benefit from finding a
style of pencil that suits your use. Soft pencils, such as HB or F, are mainly
used in freehand sketching. Choose a pencil that:
Is soft enough to produce clear black lines, but hard enough not to
smudge too easily.
Is not so soft that the point breaks easily.
Feels comfortable in your hand.
Grips the lead without slipping.
Be aware that some lead holders require special sharpeners.
You can sometimes tell the difference in hardness of a mechanical pencil
lead just by looking at it. Smaller-diameter leads are used for the harder
grades, and larger-diameter leads are used to give more strength to the
softer grades.
Plain wooden pencils work great. They are inexpensive, and it is easy to
produce thick or thin lines by varying the amount that you sharpen them.
An old trick to keep the lead sharp longer is to turn the pencil frequently as
you work to wear it down evenly.
Gum erasers and nylon erasers work well to pick up smudges without
leaving much eraser dust.Nylon eraser strips that come in refillable holders like mechanical pencils
can be convenient for areas that require some precision. A trick for erasing
fine details is to sharpen the end of the eraser strip in a small handheld
pencil sharpener.
2.14 Templates
Templates are available for a great variety of specialized needs (Figure
2.29). Templates may be found for drawing almost any ordinary drafting
symbol or repetitive feature.2.29 Drawing Templates
2.15 CAD Tools
Most people who create technical drawings use CAD. Advantages include
accuracy, speed, and the ability to present spatial and visual information in
a variety of ways.
However, these advantages do not eliminate the need for drawings to be
easily and accurately interpreted. CAD drawings use the same general
concepts and follow the same drafting standards as drawings created by
hand.
Most CAD drawings are plotted on standard sheet sizes and to similar
scales as hand drawings. Both CAD and hand drawings should contrast
thick lines for objects with thin lines for hidden, center, and dimension lines
to make the printed drawing easy to read. CAD drawings should use correct
line patterns. Likewise, lettering on CAD drawings should follow these
same general guidelines as for hand drawings.
One benefit of CAD is the ability to draw perfectly straight uniform lines
and other geometric elements. Another is the ability to quickly represent the
various styles of lines (Figure 2.30). Making changes to a CAD drawing
takes about a tenth the time that it takes to edit a drawing by hand. Using
CAD, you can quickly plot drawings to different scales.2.30 A Drawing Created Using CAD (Courtesy of Mark Perkins.)
Keeping CAD drawing files organized, backing up data regularly, and
following conventions for naming files so that you can find them again are
important considerations. Even skilled CAD users use freehand sketching,
to quickly get ideas down on paper and to show their ideas on a whiteboard.
Cad at Work
Model Space and Paper Space in Autocad
Using CAD, you can make an accurate model of the device or structure. To
do this, you create the object at the actual size that it exists in the realworld, using whatever system of measurement that you would use when
constructing it.
On paper it is a different matter. You would have to have some really large
sheets to print your building full size. AutoCAD software uses the concept
of two “spaces,” model space and paper space, to describe how to transform
the full-size CAD model to proportionate views that fit your sheet of paper.
Understanding scale as it relates to paper drawings or as it relates to
creating layouts from a CAD drawing is an important concept for technical
drawing because the ultimate goal is for drawings to be interpreted and used
in the real world. Therefore, they must be easy to print and read.(A) In AutoCAD, paper space allows you to see how various views of the full-size model can be
shown on a sheet of paper.
(B) The window at left shows a paper space representation of the full-size CAD model in the smaller
window at top right. Note that AutoCAD uses icons to help users differentiate the two “spaces.”

2.16 Sketching and Drawing Media
Many choices of media (paper and other) are available for particular
sketching or drawing purposes. Whether you are sketching or are plotting a
drawing from a CAD workstation, choose the type of sheet and size that
suits your needs.Small notebooks or sketch pads are useful when working at a site or when it
is necessary to quickly record information. Many companies require bound
notebooks of graph paper for recording engineering design notes so they are
preserved for patent and documentation purposes. Graph paper can be
helpful in making neat sketches like the one in Figure 2.31. Paper with 4, 5,
8, or 10 squares per inch is convenient for maintaining proportions.
2.31 Sketch on Graph Paper
A sketch pad of plain paper with a master grid sheet showing through
underneath works well as a substitute for grid paper. You can create your
own master grid sheets using CAD. Specially ruled isometric paper is
available for isometric sketching, or you can use CAD to create masters.The best drawing papers have up to 100% pure rag stock. Their strong
fibers hold up well to erasing and folding, and they will not discolor or
grow brittle with age. Good drafting paper should have a fine grain (or
tooth) to pick up the graphite and produce clean, dense black lines. Paper
that is too rough produces ragged, grainy lines, is harder to erase, and wears
down pencils quickly. Look for paper that has a hard surface that will not
groove too easily under pencil pressure.
Polyester film is a high-quality drafting material available in rolls and
standard sized sheets. It is made by bonding a matte surface to one or both
sides of a clear polyester sheet. Its transparency and printing qualities are
good and it provides an excellent matte drawing surface for pencil or ink. It
is easy to erase without leaving ghost marks, and it has high dimensional
stability. Its resistance to cracking, bending, and tearing makes it very
durable. Many companies still plot their drawings in ink on polyester film
for long-term storage and reproduction.
Even large coated sheets of aluminum (which provides a good dimensional
stability) have been used in the aircraft and auto industry for full-scale
layouts that were scribed into the coating with a steel point rather than a
pencil.
2.17 Standard SheetsThere are ANSI/ASME standards for international and U.S. sheet sizes.
Table 2.2 describes the height and width of these standard sheets, the letters
used to refer to them, and their margins and zones. Note that drawing sheet
size is given as height × width. Most standard sheets use what is called a
“landscape” orientation.

* May also be used as a vertical sheet size at 11′′ tall by 8.5′′ wide.
The use of the basic sheet size, 8.5′′ × 11.0′′ or 210mm × 297, and its
multiples permits filing folded prints in standard files with or without
correspondence. These sizes can be cut from standard rolls of media.
2.18 Standard Layout Elements
Margins and Borders
Each layout begins with a border drawn inside the sheet margin. Drawings
in the U.S. use a .50′′ margin. Refer to Table 2.2 for international sheet
sizes and margins. Some companies use slightly larger sheets to allow
drawings to be bound into a set. This extra allowance should be added on to
the standard sheet size so that the drawing border meets the size standards
(see Figure 2.32). Figure 2.33 shows the alternative orientation of an A size
drawing.2.32 Typical Sheet Sizes and Borders (See Table 2.2 for E-size and international standard sizes.)
2.33 Vertical Orientation of A Size
ZonesYou have probably seen zone numbers on maps, where the margin is
subdivided by letters along one side and by numbers along the other. These
are also used along the outer edges of technical drawings so that you can
refer to items by the area on the sheet where they are located. This is
particularly useful when a client calls with a question. You can use zone
numbers to make sure you are talking about the same item. Zone numbers
are also useful for locating revisions. You should provide zone numbers on
all sheets larger than size B.
Typical Letter Sizes
Most lettering on drawings should be at least 3 mm or .12′′ (about 1/8
′′
)
tall. Lettering is typically sized as follows:
Drawing Title, Drawing Size
6mm(.24′′)
DAI
6mm(.24′′)
Drawing Number, Revision Letter
6mm(.24′′)
Section and View Letters6mm(.24′′)
Zone Letters and Numbers

Drawing Block Headings
2.5mm(.10′′)
All Others
3mm(.12′′)
Title Block
The title block is located in the lower right corner of the format. Refer to
Figure 2.34 for dimensions for a typical title block for A-, B-, and C-size
sheets.* Standard areas in the title block provide the following information.2.34 Title Block for A-, B-, and C-Size Sheets
Name Show the name of the originating company or business (and address
if desired).
Drawing Title Briefly describe the item using a singular noun or noun
phrase and modifiers if necessary to distinguish it from similar items. Do
not use the terms “for” or “or” in the title. For example, “Dust Cap” would
be preferred over “Cap or Cover for Dust Protection,” which is too wordy.
Drawing Number Give each drawing a unique number, using the
company’s numbering system.
Sheet Revision Block Track the drawing version using the number of the
revision. The original release of the drawing typically shows revision 0.
Approval Block List the name(s) of the person(s) approving the drawing
and the date it was approved. Additional areas of this block can be used forvarious design activities, if separate approval is required. For example, a
company may use separate areas for structural design or manufacturing
engineering approvals (Figure 2.35). Specify the dates numerically using a
year-month-day format. For example, June 10, 1989, would be any of the
following 1989-06-10, 19890610, or 1989/06/10. This is particularly
helpful as items are easily sorted into date order by computer algorithms. It
also avoids the ambiguity caused by some countries showing month before
day, and others using the day, month, year format.
2.35 Approval Block, Scale, Revision, and Drawing Size
Scale List the predominant scale for the drawing. Drawings may include
details at other scales, which should be noted below the detail. If the
drawing is not made to a particular scale, note NONE in the scale area.
Drawing Size List the sheet size used for the drawing. This helps track the
original size when the drawing is reproduced at a smaller size.
Sheet Number List the number of the sheet in the set, using whole numbers
starting at 1. A format that lists this sheet out of the total number helps keep
track of the entire set, for example, 1 OF 2.DAI List the Design Activity Identification in this area when it is required.
This block may be left blank or the block removed if it is not needed.
Examples of DAI include: design activity name, activity name and address,
and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes if applicable.
CAGE codes are numbers assigned to entities that manufacture items for
the government, based on the DAI.
Weight List the actual or estimated weight of the part if required (Figure
2.36).
2.36 DAI and Weight May Be Listed
*For more formats, title blocks, revision blocks, and materials blocks, see
inside the front cover of this book.
2.19 Layouts
A particular size sheet with a drawing border is called a layout. Using a
CAD system, you may often be able to select from standard layouts or
templates that set the sheet size limits, the border, and even the title block asthe starting point for your drawing. Regardless of whether you draw by
hand or use CAD or 3D modeling methods, you need to plan your sheet so
that the information will fit and show clearly.
When you are sketching, your layout may be a simple border and title strip
along the bottom of the sheet (or you may be using preprinted tablets that
have space to record the sketch title, date, and other pertinent data).
When creating a 2D CAD drawing, you may use a drawing template
showing the sheet and border and title block, perhaps using different
templates or even software interface settings for different types of drawings,
such as mechanical/manufacturing, architectural, or civil.
When creating a 2D drawing from a 3D solid model, you may use a layout
space that contains different viewports that allow you to show different
views of the same 3D model with a border and title block.
2.20 Planning Your Drawing or Sketch
When laying out a drawing sheet, you will need to consider:
the size and scale of the object you will show;
the sheet size;
the measurement system (units) for the drawing; and
the space necessary for standard notes and title block.The object you are drawing is the “star” of the sketch. Keep the object near
the center of the sheet. It should be boldly drawn, using thick visible lines.
Make it large enough to fill most of the sheet and so that details show
clearly (Figure 2.37).2.37 Show details clearly by selecting the appropriate scale and sheet size.
Show Details ClearlyShow small objects larger than their actual size to represent the details
clearly. If the details are too small, switch to a larger sheet size and use a
larger scale.
You can also add details at a larger scale if necessary to show features that
are smaller than the typical features of the drawing. If you add details at a
different scale, label the view, for example, DETAIL A, and note the scale
for the detail below it.
Step by Step
Sheet Layout
 To draw the part shown in the given figure, select the sheet size,
keeping in mind the size of the objects. Show the part large enough to
represent features clearly. Use larger sheets for larger or more detailed
objects. (8.5′′ × 11′′ will be large enough for the part shown.) Add theborder and title block to the sheet using the margin sizes specified in the
standards. Refer to Table 2.2.
 Determine the units for the drawing. Will it be metric or U.S.
Customary (inches, feet and inches)? What system will be used to construct,
manufacture, and inspect the actual object? Use that system of measurement
for the drawing. This part is in inches.
Before you begin drawing, determine the scale at which the object will best
fit on the sheet.First, figure the available space within the drawing border. For example, the
horizontal 8.5′′ × 11′′ sheet with a .5′′ margin leaves 7.5′′ × 10′′. If you
subtract space for a .375′′ title strip across the bottom, it leaves 
7.125′′ × 10′′ for the drawing.
Now, consider the size of the object. Will it fit on the sheet at full size? Half
size? Do you need to enlarge it to show small features larger than actual
size? The 12′′ gasket shown in the example will fit well at half size on the 
8.5′′ × 11′′ sheet and still show the details clearly. Use typical scales when
possible. Refer to Section 2.5.
Approximately center the object on the sheet. To do this, subtract the size of
the scaled drawing from the available sheet space and use half of the
difference on each side of the object.
 One quick technique is to find the center of the available space and
lay out the drawing on each side of that centerline. Using CAD, you can
easily move the drawing to the center of the sheet visually.Sketches do not have to be perfectly centered, but plan ahead so the
drawing isn’t crammed in one corner of the sheet. Let your drawing be the
“star” of the page. Remember to leave enough space around your drawing
for notes and dimensions. If you don’t, you will run out of room and your
layout will look crowded.
 Lightly add details of the drawing.
 Darken final drawing lines.Tip
Scale When Using CAD
Keep in mind that when using CAD you will create the object the size that
it actually exists in real life. On the plotted sheet, when showing the
drawing to scale, it is easy to try a few different scales and see which fits.
You can always change the scale later if needed.
Cad at Work
Scaling Annotations Automatically Using Autocad
You might think that displaying text in a CAD drawing is one of the easiest
things to do. You can quickly type in the text you want to display and select
the font, height, slant, and rotation angle. That part is easy, but annotations
are useless if nobody can read them.
When you create drawings that will be plotted on different sized sheets or at
different scales, sizing the text can require a lot of planning. Take the
architectural plan drawing shown in Figure A for example. When plotted to
scale 1/2
′′ = 1′, the text showing dimensions is clearly visible. But when
shown at one tenth of that size, scale 1/2
′′ = 10′, that same text becomes
illegible.The ability to reuse the same CAD data at different scales without having to
recreate the drawing is one of its big advantages over pen and paper
drawings. Yet, cumbersome workarounds were once necessary to make
legible text at different scales. One workaround was to have several
different sizes of the same text, which the user would turn on or off
depending on what drawing scale was used.
Now, AutoCAD software provides a feature called annotation scaling. Here
is how it works: Drawing objects that are commonly used to annotate
drawings (provide text information) can have their annotation property
turned on. This allows you to create one annotative object that displays at
different sizes, based on scale properties.
In the AutoCAD software, object types that can have annotative object
properties include text, mtext, dimensions, hatches, tolerances, multileaders,
leaders, blocks, and attributes.(A) When plotted to a scale of 1/2
′′ = 1′ on an 11′′ × 8.5′′ sheet, the text showing the dimensions is
clearly visible. (Courtesy of Centermark Industries, Inc.)(B) The annotation scaling feature of AutoCAD software allows annotative text to be made legible at
various scales. (Autodesk screen shots reprinted courtesy of Autodesk, Inc.)

OverviewThe ability to envision objects in three dimensions is one of the most
important skills for scientists, designers, engineers, and technicians.
Learning to visualize objects in space, to imagine constructively, is
something you can learn by studying technical drawing. People who are
extraordinarily creative often possess outstanding ability to visualize, but
with practice anyone can improve his or her ability.
In addition to its role in developing spatial thinking skills, sketching is a
valuable tool that allows you to communicate your ideas quickly and
accurately. During the development stage of an idea, a picture is often worth
a thousand words.
Sketching is also an efficient way to plan your drawing and record notes
needed to create a complex object. When you sketch basic ideas ahead of
time, you can often complete a final CAD drawing sooner and with fewer
errors. Using good technique makes sketching faster, easier, and more
legible.Complex Surface Models Created Using 3D CAD (Courtesy of Professor Richard Palais, University of California,
Irvine, and Luc Benard.)
Understanding Solid Objects
Sketches and drawings are used to communicate or record ideas about the
shape of 3D objects. Before starting to sketch, it helps to develop a
vocabulary for understanding and discussing 3D shapes.
Three-dimensional figures are referred to as solids. Solids are bounded by
the surfaces that contain them. These surfaces can be one of the following
four types:
PlanarSingle curved
Double curved
Warped
Regardless of how complex a solid may be, it is composed of combinations
of these basic types of surfaces. Figure 3.1 shows examples of the four
basic types of surfaces.
images
3.1 Types of Surfaces
Types of Solids
Polyhedra
Solids that are bounded by plane surfaces are called polyhedra (Figures
3.2–3.4). These planar surfaces are also referred to as faces of the object. A
polygon is a planar area that is enclosed by straight lines.
images
3.2 Regular Polyhedra
images
3.3 Right Prisms and Oblique Prisms
images
3.4 PyramidsRegular Polyhedra
If the faces of a solid are equal regular polygons, it is called a regular
polyhedron. There are five regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, hexahedron,
octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron (Figure 3.2).
Prisms
A prism has two bases, which are parallel equal polygons, and three or
more additional faces, which are parallelograms (Figure 3.3). A triangular
prism has triangular bases, a rectangular prism has rectangular bases, and so
on. (If a prism’s bases happen to be parallelograms, the prism is a called a
parallelepiped, a word rarely heard in everyday conversation.)
A right prism has faces and lateral (side) edges that are perpendicular to the
bases; an oblique prism has faces and lateral edges that are angled to the
bases. If one end is cut off to form an end that is not parallel to the bases,
the prism is said to be truncated (a word that simply means “shortened by
having a part cut off”).
Pyramids
A pyramid has a polygon for a base and triangular lateral faces that
intersect at a common point called the vertex (Figure 3.4). The line from the
center of the base to the vertex is called the axis. If the axis is perpendicular
to the base, the pyramid is called a right pyramid; otherwise, it is an obliquepyramid. A triangular pyramid has a triangular base, a square pyramid has a
square base, and so on. If a portion near the vertex has been cut off, the
pyramid is truncated; if the face formed by truncation is parallel to the base,
the shape is referred to as a frustum.
Cylinders
A cylinder has a single-curved exterior surface (Figure 3.5). You can think
of a cylinder as being formed by taking a straight line and moving it in a
circular path to enclose a volume. Each position of this imaginary straight
line in its path around the axis is called an element of the cylinder.
images
3.5 Cylinder and Oblique Cylinder
Cones
A cone has a single-curved exterior surface (Figure 3.6). You can think of it
as being formed by moving one end of a straight line around a circle while
keeping the other end fixed at a point, the vertex of the cone. An element of
the cone is any position of this imaginary straight line.
images
3.6 Cones
SpheresA sphere has a double-curved exterior surface (Figure 3.7). You can think
of it as being formed by revolving a circle about one of its diameters,
somewhat like spinning a coin. The poles of the sphere are the points at the
top and bottom of the sphere that would not move while it was spinning.
The axis of the sphere is the term for the line between its poles.
images
3.7 Sphere
Tori
A torus is shaped like a doughnut (Figure 3.8). Its boundary surface is
double curved. You can think of it as being formed by revolving a circle (or
other closed curve) around an axis that is positioned away from (outside)
the curve.
images
3.8 Torus
Ellipsoids
An oblate or prolate ellipsoid is shaped like an egg (Figure 3.9). You can
think of it as being formed by revolving an ellipse about its minor or major
axis, respectively.
images3.9 Ellipsoids
Understanding Sketching Techniques
Analyzing Complex Objects
The ability to break down complex shapes into simpler geometric
primitives is an essential skill for sketching and modeling objects.
Before you begin to draw the outline of an object, consider its overall shape
and the relationships between its parts. Construction lines can help you
preserve the overall dimensions of the object as you sketch.
Bear in mind that you should be thinking in terms of basic shapes whether
you are sketching by hand or using a CAD program. Because basic curves
and straight lines are the basis of many of the objects that people create,
practice in creating the basic elements of a drawing will help you sketch
with ease.
Essential Shapes
Look for the essential shapes of objects. If you were to make a clay model
of an object, what basic shape would you start with? A ball? A box?
Try squinting your eyes and looking at familiar objects. Do you see their
shape as a rectangle? A circle? What other basic shapes do you notice when
you look at objects this way?Think about breaking down more complex objects into their simpler
geometric shapes as shown in Figure 3.10. You can block in these shapes
using construction lines to show their relationships to one another. Then,
add details, continuing to pay attention to the spatial relationships between
them.
images
3.10 Identifying Essential Shapes
images
3.11 The essential shapes of the corkscrew in the photo are sketched at right.
Construction Lines
Artists often begin a sketch by blocking in light guidelines to help them
preserve basic shapes and proportions. In technical drawing these are called
construction lines (Figure 3.12).
images
3.12 Using Construction Lines
It is often helpful to begin a sketch by describing the object’s main shapes
with construction lines, taking some care to accurately represent the relative
size and placement of features.Use the basic shapes as a guide to place key features, then use those main
features as a “reference map” to place smaller details. For example, the
sixth fret line is about halfway up the rectangular guitar neck.
Throughout this chapter you will use light construction lines to draw
circles, arcs, and ellipses. Section 3.4 discusses the process of estimating
and maintaining the proportions of an object in further detail.
Contours and Negative Space
The contours of an object are the main outlines that separate it from the
surrounding space. One way to think about the contours of objects is to look
at the contrast between the positive and negative space. Positive space is the
space occupied by the object. Negative space is the unoccupied space
around it.
In Figure 3.13 the space occupied by the contour of a pair of scissors is
shown. Note how you can identify specific shapes by looking at the
negative space. The individual shapes that make up the negative space are
shown in different colors to make them easier for you to see. Some people
sketch more accurately when they try to draw the negative space that
surrounds the object.
images
3.13 Negative SpaceTip
Practice Drawing Contours
Try sketching the negative spaces that define the shape of a chair. Look at
each space as an individual shape. What is the shape of the space between
the legs? What is the shape of the space between the rungs and the seat?
images
Make a sketch of a chair, paying careful attention to sketching the negative
spaces of the chair as they really appear. The positive and negative spaces
should add up to define the chair.
If you have difficulty, make corrections to your sketch by defining the
positive shapes and then check to see if the negative shapes match.
An 8.5′′ × 11′′ sheet of Plexiglas (available at most glass stores) is an
excellent tool for developing sketching ability. Using a dry-erase marker,
hold the Plexiglas up in front of an object and trace the object’s contours
on the Plexiglas. If you don’t move, the outline should match the object’s
outline exactly. Lower the Plexiglas and look at the orientation of the lines.
Are they what you expected?
Try looking at the object and drawing the sketch with the Plexiglas lying
on your desktop or knees. Then, raise it and see if your drawing matches
®the object.
To develop sketching ability, try drawing everyday objects like your
toaster, printer, or lamp, as well as exterior and interior views of buildings
and equipment.

Viewpoint
As you sketch objects, keep in mind that you want to maintain a consistent
viewpoint, as a camera does. This is easier when you are sketching a picture
from a book, because you can’t move around the object. When you move,
you see a different view of the object depending on where you stand.
Sometimes people have difficulty sketching because they want to show
parts of the object that cannot really be seen from a single viewpoint. For
example, knowing that the handle of the rubber stamp in Figure 3.14appears circular from the top, you may be tempted to show it as round, even
though it may appear elliptical from your viewpoint.
images
3.14 Rubber Stamp
When you are sketching an object pictorially, temporarily set aside your
knowledge of the shapes the object is actually made of and carefully
examine the shapes you see from a single, static viewpoint. In this type of
sketching, instead of trying to envision the object as it is, try only to see it
as it looks.
Shading
Adding shading to your sketch can give it a more realistic appearance
because it represents the way the actual object would reflect light. Shading
doesn’t mean “coloring in.” You may want to shade only the most
prominently shadowed areas. First, identify the darkest and lightest areas on
an object. If you want, you can shade various middle tones, placed exactly
as they look on the object.
In some ways, shading is like doing a drawing within a drawing, because it
is a matter of identifying shapes. When you are shading, instead of
identifying the shapes of the object’s contours, you are identifying the shape
and relative darkness of the shadows.Hatching lines, shown in Figure 3.15, and stippling, shown in Figure 3.16,
are commonly used methods to add shading because they are easier to
reproduce with a photocopier than continuous-tone pencil shading. In the
illustration, you can see that shadowed areas are darkened simply by adding
more hatching lines or stippling dots.
It is not uncommon for people to draw outlines by hand and add digital
shaded fills to a scan of the outline. Another way to make a subject the clear
focal point of a drawing is to stylize the shadows. Industrial designers often
use markers to add a stylized shadow to their sketches. You can use a
straight edge to protect the original sketch from the marker and quickly
sketch the shadow (Figure 3.17).
images
3.15 Hatching

3.16 Stippling

3.17 Marker Shading in a Concept Sketch (Courtesy of Douglas Wintin.)
Regardless of how you apply shading, darken the outline to define the shape
clearly and boldly. Remember that when you are communicating by using asketch, its subject should be clear. To make the subject—in this case, a
rubber stamp—clear, make it stand out with thick bold contour lines.
Edges and Vertices
Edges
An edge of a solid is formed where two surfaces intersect. Edges are
represented in drawings by visible or hidden lines (Figure 3.18).
images
3.18 Edges and Vertices of a Solid
Vertices
A vertex (plural, vertices) of a solid is formed where three or more surfaces
intersect. The end of an edge is a vertex. These vertices or “points” are very
useful in defining the locations of the solid object feature that you will
sketch (Figure 3.18).
Points and Lines
A point is used to represent a location in space but has no width, height, or
depth (Figure 3.19). A point in a drawing is represented by the intersection
of two lines (Figure 3.19a), by a short crossbar on a line (Figure 3.19b), or
by a small cross (Figure 3.19c). Do not represent points by simple dots on
the paper. This makes the drawing look “blobby” and is not as accurate.images
3.19 Showing Points
A line is used in drawings to represent the edge of a solid object. A straight
line is the shortest distance between two points and is commonly referred to
simply as a “line.” If the line is indefinite in extent, in a drawing the length
is a matter of convenience, and the endpoints are not marked (Figure 3.20a).
If the endpoints of the line are significant, they are marked by small drawn
crossbars (Figure 3.20b). Other common terms are illustrated in Figures
3.20c to i. Either straight lines or curved lines are parallel if the shortest
distance between them remains constant. The common symbol for parallel
lines is | |, and for perpendicular lines it is ⊥. Two perpendicular lines may
be marked with a “box” as shown in Figure 3.20g. Such symbols may be
used on sketches, but not on production drawings.
images
3.20 Showing Lines
Angles
An angle is formed by two intersecting lines. A common symbol for angle
is ∠.
There are 360 degrees (360°) in a full circle, as shown in Figure 3.21a. A
degree is divided into 60 minutes (60′), and a minute is divided into 60
seconds (60′′). The angle value 37°26′10′′ is read 37 degrees, 26 minutes,and 10 seconds. When minutes alone are indicated, the number of minutes
should be preceded by 0°, as in 0°20′. If the minutes value were listed
alone without showing the zero value, it might be mistaken for a distance
measurement. For example, 20 minutes, 10 seconds written as 20′10′′
might be mistaken for 20 feet 10 inches.
images
3.21 Showing Angles
The different kinds of angles are illustrated in Figure 3.21. Two angles are
complementary if they total 90° (Figure 3.21f) and are supplementary if
they total 180° (Figure 3.21g).
In sketching, most angles can be estimated. Use a protractor if necessary
when drawing odd angles.
Drawings and Sketches
The following are important skills to keep in mind for sketches and
drawings:
1. Accuracy. No drawing is useful unless it shows the information
correctly.
2. Speed. Time is money in industry. Work smarter and learn to use
techniques to speed up your sketching and CAD drawings while still
producing neat accurate results.3. Legibility. A drawing is a means of communicating with others, so it
must be clear and legible. Give attention to details. Things that may
seem picky and small as you are drawing may be significant and save
money or even lives when the product is built.
4. Neatness. If a drawing is to be accurate and legible, it must also be clean.
Accuracy Counts
images
Accuracy and legibility in drawings is serious business, as is demonstrated in this article from New
Scientist magazine about the September 2004 Genesis dizzy probe crash. (Photo courtesy of NASA.)
Dizzy Probe Crash
You would think that by now, NASA should be able to tell up from down.
Not so in the case of their Genesis space capsule, which crashed into the
desert in Utah instead of parachuting gently down so that helicopter stunt
pilots could pluck it to safety.
Since its launch in August 2001, the capsule had been collecting precious
particles from the solar wind that would have told us something about the
composition of the solar system. But after reentering Earth’s atmosphere on
September 8, 2004, Genesis plunged into the ground, and much of its
payload was lost.On October 15, investigators released their preliminary conclusions,
blaming the crash on “a design error that involves the orientation of gravity￾switch devices.” Huh?
The four small cylindrical switches were designed to sense the reentry and
trigger the parachute. But they were drawn upside down in Lockheed
Martin’s technical drawings, so they were installed upside down—although
NASA’s Michael Ryschkewitsch, who led the investigation, is reluctant to
use those exact words. The switches never detected the reentry. Similar
devices are installed on another sample-collecting mission called Stardust.
Ryschkewitsch believes these were installed the right way up.

Freehand Sketching
Freehand sketches are a helpful way to organize your thoughts and record
ideas. They provide a quick, low-cost way to explore various solutions to
design problems so that the best choices can be made. Investing too much
time in creating a detailed layout before exploring your options through
sketches can be costly.
The degree of precision needed in a given sketch depends on its use. Quick
sketches to supplement verbal descriptions may be rough and incomplete.Sketches can be used to convey important and precise information when
they are clearly drawn and annotated.
Freehand sketching requires only pencil, paper, and eraser. Mastering the
techniques in this chapter for showing quick single-view, oblique,
perspective, and isometric drawings using good freehand line technique will
give you a valuable tool for communicating your ideas.
The term freehand sketch does not mean a sloppy drawing. As shown in
Figure 3.22, a freehand sketch shows attention to proportion, clarity, and
correct line widths. Figure 3.23 shows an as-built drawing with corrected
items sketched on the printed CAD drawing.

or to provide information on repairing existing equipment.

3.1 Technique of Lines
The chief difference between a drawing and a freehand sketch lies in the
character or technique of the lines. A good freehand line is not expected to
be as rigidly straight or exactly uniform. A good freehand line showsfreedom and variety, whereas a line drawn using CAD or instruments
should be exact. Still, it is important to distinguish between line patterns to
make your drawing legible.
The line patterns in Figure 3.24 are examples of good freehand quality.
Figure 3.25 shows examples of good and poor technique.
images
3.24 Freehand Alphabet of Lines (Full Size)
images
3.25 Technique of Lines (Enlarged)
Lineweights
Make dimension, extension, and centerlines thin, sharp, and black.
Make hidden lines medium and black.
Make visible and cutting-plane lines thick and black.
Make construction lines thick and light.
Tip
Even in freehand drawings, thick lines should be twice the width of thin
lines.Thicknesses do not have to be exact, but there should be an obvious
difference between thick and thin lines.
Because visible lines and cutting-plane lines are the two thick line patterns,
other lines should be distinctly thinner in comparison.
images
To draw thick and thin lines freehand, you might like to keep two pencils
handy, one that is razor sharp for thin lines and another that is dulled, to
create thicker lines.
As the sharp point becomes dulled, switch it with the dull pencil, and
sharpen the other, so that there is always one sharp and one dulled point
ready to use.
3.2 Sketching Straight Lines
Most of the lines in an average sketch are straight lines. With practice, your
straight lines will naturally improve, but these basics may help you improve
quickly.
Hold your pencil naturally, about 1′′ back from the point, and
approximately at a right angle to the line to be drawn.Draw horizontal lines from left to right with a free and easy wrist and
arm movement.
Draw vertical lines downward with a wrist and arm movement.
Draw curved lines using finger and wrist movements.
Blocking in a Freehand Drawing
Over the years, freehand sketchers have developed all sorts of tricks to
improve speed and accuracy. Methods for finding midpoints or quickly
blocking in straight vertical and horizontal lines are just a few secrets of the
technical sketching craft that can come in handy, even today. When a great
idea hits, or you need to sketch quickly at a meeting or on a job site, you
might not have access to a CAD system, or even a ruler.
Tips
Drawing Long Freehand Lines
For long freehand lines, make light end marks and lightly sweep your
pencil between them, keeping your eye on the mark toward which you are
moving. When you are satisfied with the accuracy of your strokes, apply
more pressure to make a dark line.
images
imagesBlocking in a Border Freehand
Hold your hand and pencil rigidly and glide your fingertips along the edge
of the paper to maintain a uniform border.
images
Blocking in a Border Using a Strip of Paper
Mark the distance on the edge of a card or a strip of paper and use it like a
ruler to mark at intervals, then draw a final line through the points.
images
If your line looks like this, you may be gripping your pencil too tightly or
trying too hard to imitate mechanical lines.
images
Slight wiggles are OK as long as the line continues on a straight path.
Occasional very slight gaps are fine and make it easier to draw straight.images
Finding a Midpoint Freehand
Use your thumb on your pencil to guess half the distance. Try this distance
on the other half. Continue adjusting until you locate the center, then mark
it.
images
Folding a Paper to Find a Midpoint
Mark the total distance on the edge of a strip of paper, then fold the paper
to locate its center at the crease. You can fold one half to find quarter
points, and so on.
images
Step by Step
Dividing Lines into Equal or Proportional Parts
Proportional PartsTo divide the given line shown into proportions of (for example) 2, 3, and 4
units:
images
images Draw a vertical construction line at one end of the line you are
dividing.
images
images Set the zero point of your scale at the other end of the line.
images Swing the scale so the desired unit falls on the vertical line. In this
case it will be the 9th unit, because 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.
images
images Draw vertical lines upward from the corresponding scale divisions
and mark tiny crossbars on the line as shown.
Equal Parts
If you use uniform divisions for the steps above (every third division, for
instance) you will get equal parts. Examples of practical applications for
dividing lines equally are shown below.
imagesimages
images
Calculated Proportions
To divide a line into proportions equal to the square of 1, 2, 3, and 4 (1, 4, 9,
and 16), find 16 divisions on your scale.
images Set the zero point of your scale at the end of the line and draw a
light construction line at any convenient angle from one end of the line you
are dividing to the appropriate division on the scale. In this case the 4 mark
is 16 equal divisions from the 0.
images Draw construction lines parallel to the end line through each
proportionate scale division.
images
Tip
Exaggerating Closely Spaced Parallel LinesSometimes it is helpful to exaggerate the distance between closely spaced
parallel lines so there is no fill-in when the drawing is reproduced.
Usually this is done to a maximum of 3 mm or .120′′. When using CAD it
is better to draw the features the actual size and include a detail showing
the actual spacing.
3.3 Sketching Circles, Arcs, and Ellipses
Circles
Small circles can be sketched using one or two strokes, without blocking in
any construction lines. Circle templates also make it easy to sketch circles
of various sizes.
For better looking freehand sketched circles of larger sizes, try the
construction methods shown here. Figure 3.26 shows an object with
rounded features to sketch using circles, arcs, and ellipses.
images
3.26 Many objects have rounded features that circles, arcs, and ellipses are used to represent.

Tip
The Freehand CompassUsing your hand like a compass, you can create circles and arcs with
surprising accuracy after a few minutes of practice.
images
1. Place the tip of your little finger or the knuckle joint of your little finger
at the center.
2. “Feed” the pencil out to the radius you want as you would do with a
compass.
3. Hold this position rigidly and rotate the paper with your free hand.

lines. Mark off the radius distance along the lines.

rapidly above the paper in an elliptical path.images

Axes Method
images
images
images Lightly sketch in the major and minor axes of the ellipse.images Mark the distance along the axes and lightly block in the ellipse.
images Darken the final ellipse.
Trammel Method
images
images To sketch accurate ellipses, you can make a trammel.
images
images Mark half the desired length of the minor axis on the edge of a
strip of paper (A-B). Using the same starting point, mark half the length of
the major axis (A-C). (The measurements will overlap.)
images
images Line up the last two trammel points (B and C) on the axes and
mark a small dot at the location of the first point (A).
images
images Move the trammel to different positions, keeping B and C on the
axes, and mark more points at A. Sketch the final ellipse through the points.Sketching Arcs
Sketching arcs is similar to sketching circles. In general, it is easier to hold
your pencil on the inside of the curve. Look closely at the actual geometric
constructions and carefully approximate points of tangency so that the arc
touches a line or other entity at the right point.
Sketching Ellipses
If a circle is tipped away from your view, it appears as an ellipse. Figure
3.27 shows a coin viewed so that it appears as an ellipse. You can learn to
sketch small ellipses with a free arm movement similar to the way you
sketch circles, or you can use ellipse templates to help you easily sketch
ellipses. These templates are usually grouped according to the amount a
circular shape would be rotated to form the ellipse. They provide a number
of sizes of ellipses on each template but usually include only one or two
typical rotations.
images
3.27 A Circle Seen as an Ellipse
3.4 Maintaining ProportionsSketches are not usually made to a specific scale, although it can be handy
to do so at times. The size of the sketch depends on its complexity and the
size of the paper available. The most important rule in freehand sketching is
to keep the sketch in proportion, which means to accurately represent the
size and position of each part in relation to the whole. No matter how
brilliant the technique or how well drawn the details, if the proportions are
off, the sketch will not look right.
To maintain proportions, first determine the relative proportions of height to
width and lightly block them in. You can mark a unit on the edge of a strip
of paper or use your pencil (as in Figure 3.28) to gauge how many units
wide and high the object is. Grid paper can help you maintain proportions
by providing a ready-made scale (by counting squares). As you block in the
medium-size areas, and later as you add small details, compare each new
distance with those already established.
images
3.28 Estimating Dimensions
Step by Step
Maintaining Proportions in a Sketch
imagesimages If you are working from a given picture, such as this utility
cabinet, first establish the relative width compared to the height. One way is
to use the pencil as a measuring stick. In this case, the height is about 1-3/4
times the width.

images Sketch the enclosing rectangle in the correct proportion. This
sketch is to be slightly larger than the given picture.
images
images Divide the available drawer space into three parts with the pencil

try again. Sketch light diagonals to locate centers of the drawers and block
in drawer handles. Sketch all remaining details.

the desired percentage and transfer the lines of the shape through the
corresponding points in the new set of squares.3.5 One-View Drawings
Frequently, a single view supplemented by notes and dimensions is enough
information to describe the shape of a relatively simple object.
In Figure 3.29, one view of the shim plus a note indicating the thickness as
0.25 mm is sufficient.

letter NONE in the Scale area of the title block.
3.6 Pictorial Sketching
A pictorial sketch represents a 3D object on a 2D sheet of paper by
orienting the object so you can see its width, height, and depth in a singleview.
Pictorial sketches are used frequently during the ideation phase of
engineering design to record ideas quickly and communicate them to others.
Their similarity to how the object is viewed in the real world makes them
useful for communicating engineering designs to nonengineers. Later in the
design process, pictorial drawings are often used to show how parts fit
together in an assembly and, in part catalogs and manuals, to make it easy
to identify the objects.
This chapter examines three common methods used to sketch pictorials:
isometric sketching, which is a subtype of the general category of
axonometric projection, oblique sketching, and perspective sketching.
Figure 3.30 shows perspective, isometric, and oblique sketches of a stapler.
Figure 3.31 shows pictorial sketches for backpack concepts.
images
3.30 Three Types of Pictorial Sketches
images
3.31 Pictorial sketching is used frequently to convey preliminary design ideas, as in these backpack
concept sketches. (Courtesy of André Cotan.)
Each of the pictorial methods differs in the way points on the object are
located on the 2D viewing plane (the piece of paper).A perspective sketch presents the most realistic looking view. It shows the
object much as it would appear in a photograph—portions of the object that
are farther from the viewer appear smaller, and lines recede into the
distance.
An axonometric sketch is drawn so that lines do not recede into the distance
but remain parallel. This makes isometric views easy to sketch but takes
away somewhat from the realistic appearance.
An oblique sketch shows the front surface of the object looking straight on
and is easy to create, but it presents the least realistic representation because
the depth of the object appears to be out of proportion.
Various types of pictorial drawings are used extensively in catalogs, sales
literature, and technical work. They are often used in patent drawings; in
piping diagrams; in machine, structural, architectural design, and in
furniture design; and for ideation sketching. The sketches for a wooden
shelf in Figure 3.32 are examples of axonometric, orthographic, and
perspective sketches.
images
3.32 Sketches for a Wooden Shelf Using Axonometric, Orthographic, and Perspective Drawing
Techniques. The axonometric projections in this sketch are drawn in isometric. (Courtesy of Douglas
Wintin.)In axonometric and oblique drawings, distant features are not shown
proportionately smaller, the way they appear in a photograph or to our
vision. Edges that are parallel on the object always appear parallel in an
axonometric view. The most common axonometric projection is isometric,
which means “equal measure.” When a cube is drawn in isometric, the axes
are equally spaced (120° apart). Though not as realistic as perspective
drawings, isometric drawings are much easier to draw. CAD software often
displays the results of 3D models on the screen as isometric projections.
Some CAD software allows you to choose between isometric, axonometric
views (see Figure 3.35 for examples), or perspective representation of your
3D models on the 2D computer screen. In sketching, dimetric and trimetric
sometimes produce a better view than isometric but take longer to draw and
are therefore used less frequently.
3.7 Projection Methods
The four principal types of projection are shown in Figure 3.33. All except
the regular multiview projection (Figure 3.33a) are pictorial types, because
they show several sides of the object in a single view. In both multiview
projection and axonometric projection, the visual rays are parallel to each
other and perpendicular to the plane of projection. Both are types of
orthographic projection (Figures 3.33a and 3.33b).
images images images images
3.33 Four Types of ProjectionIn oblique projection (Figure 3.33c), the visual rays are parallel to each
other but at an angle other than 90° to the plane of projection.
In perspective (Figure 3.33d), the visual rays extend from the observer’s
eye, or station point (SP), to all points of the object to form a “cone of
rays,” so that the portions of the object that are farther away from the
observer appear smaller than the closer portions of the object.
3.8 Axonometric Projection
The feature that distinguishes axonometric projection from multiview
projection is the inclined position of the object with respect to the planes of
projection. When a surface or edge of the object is not parallel to the plane
of projection, it appears foreshortened. When an angle is not parallel to the
plane of projection, it appears either smaller or larger than the true angle.
To create an axonometric view, the object is tipped to the planes of
projection so that principal faces, such as the top, side, and front, show in a
single view. This produces a pictorial drawing that is easy to visualize, but
because the principal edges and surfaces of the object are inclined to the
plane of projection, the lengths of the lines are foreshortened. The angles
between surfaces and edges appear either larger or smaller than the true
angle. There are an infinite variety of ways that the object may be oriented
with respect to the plane of projection.The degree of foreshortening of any line depends on its angle to the plane
of projection. The greater the angle, the greater the foreshortening. Once the
degree of foreshortening is determined for each of the three edges of the
cube that meet at one corner, scales can be easily constructed for measuring
along these edges or any other edges parallel to them (Figure 3.34).
images
3.34 Measurements are foreshortened proportionately based on the amount of incline.
Use the three edges of the cube that meet at the corner nearest your view as
the axonometric axes. Figure 3.35 shows three axonometric projections.
images
3.35 Axonometric Projections
Isometric projection (Figure 3.35a) has equal foreshortening along each of
the three axis directions.
Dimetric projection (Figure 3.35b) has equal foreshortening along two axis
directions and a different amount of foreshortening along the third axis.
This is because it is not tipped an equal amount to all the principal planes of
projection.
Trimetric projection (Figure 3.35c) has different foreshortening along all
three axis directions. This view is produced by an object that is unequally
tipped to all the planes of projection.Axonometric Projections and 3D Models
When you create a 3D CAD model, the object is stored so that vertices,
surfaces, and solids are all defined relative to a 3D coordinate system. You
can rotate your view of the object to produce a view from any direction.
However, your computer screen is a flat surface, like a sheet of paper. The
CAD software uses similar projection to produce the view transformations,
creating the 2D view of the object on your computer screen. Most 3D CAD
software provides a variety of preset isometric viewing directions to make it
easy for you to manipulate the view. Some CAD software also allows for
easy perspective viewing on screen.
After rotating the object you may want to return to a preset typical
axonometric view like one of the examples shown in Figure 3.36.

3.9 Isometric Projection
In an isometric projection, all angles between the axonometric axes are
equal. To produce an isometric projection, you orient the object so that its
principal edges (or axes) make equal angles with the plane of projection and
are therefore foreshortened equally. Oriented this way, the edges of a cubeare projected so that they all measure the same and make equal angles (of
120°) with each other, as shown in Figure 3.37.
images
3.37 Isometric Projection
Isometric Axes
The projections of the edges of a cube make angles of 120° with each other.
You can use these as the isometric axes from which to make measurements.
Any line parallel to one of these is called an isometric line. The angles in
the isometric projection of the cube are either 120° or 60°, and all are
projections of 90° angles. In an isometric projection of a cube, the faces of
the cube, and any planes parallel to them, are called isometric planes. See
Figure 3.38.
images
3.38 Isometric Axes
Nonisometric Lines
Lines of an isometric drawing that are not parallel to the isometric axes are
called nonisometric lines (Figure 3.39). Only lines of an object that are
drawn parallel to the isometric axes are equally foreshortened.
Nonisometric lines are drawn at other angles and are not equallyforeshortened. Therefore the lengths of features along nonisometric lines
cannot be measured directly with a scale.
images
3.39 Nonisometric Edges
Isometric Scales
An isometric scale can be used to draw correct isometric projections. All
distances in this scale are 2/3× true size, or approximately 80% of true
size. Figure 3.40a shows an isometric scale. More commonly, an isometric
sketch or drawing is created using a standard scale, as in Figure 3.40b,
disregarding the foreshortening that the tipped surfaces would produce in a
true projection. Figure 3.40c shows an isometric view of a 10′′ cube
modeled in 3D. When measured parallel to the view, the length appears to
be 8.1650 due to the foreshortening (near 80% of the actual size).
images
3.40 Isometric and Ordinary Scales
Tip
Making an Isometric Scale
imagesYou can make an isometric scale from a strip of paper or cardboard by
placing an ordinary scale at 45° to a horizontal line and the paper
(isometric) scale at 30° to the horizontal line. To mark the increments on
the isometric scale, draw straight lines (perpendicular to the horizontal
line) from the division lines on the ordinary scale.
Alternatively, you can approximate an isometric scale. Scaled
measurements of 9′′= 1′−0, or three-quarter-size scale (or metric
equivalent) can be used as an approximation.
3.10 Isometric Drawings
When you make a drawing using foreshortened measurements, or when the
object is actually projected on a plane of projection, it is called an isometric
projection (Figure 3.40a). When you make a drawing using the full-length
measurements of the actual object, it is an isometric sketch or isometric
drawing (Figure 3.40b) to indicate that it lacks foreshortening.
The isometric drawing is about 25% larger than the isometric projection,
but the pictorial value is obviously the same in both. Because isometric
sketches are quicker (because you can use the actual measurements), they
are much more commonly drawn.
TipSome CAD software will notify you about the lack of foreshortening in
isometric drawings (or allow you to select for it) when you print or save
them.
Positions of the Isometric Axes
The first step in making an isometric drawing is to decide along which axis
direction to show the height, width, and depth, respectively. Figure 3.41
shows four different orientations that you might start with to create an
isometric drawing of the block shown. Each is an isometric drawing of the
same block, but with a different corner facing your view. These are only a
few of many possible orientations.

3.41 Positions of Isometric Axes
3.42 Isometric Options. These views of a simple model of a house are all isometric, but some show
the features better than others.You may orient the axes in any desired position, but the angle between them
must remain 120°. In selecting an orientation for the axes, choose the
position from which the object is usually viewed, or determine the position
that best describes the shape of the object, or better yet, both.
If the object is a long part, it will look best with the long axis oriented
horizontally.
3.11 Making an Isometric Drawing
Rectangular objects are easy to draw using box construction, which
consists of imagining the object enclosed in a rectangular box whose sides
coincide with the main faces of the object. For example, imagine the object
shown in the two views in the Step by Step feature at right enclosed in a
construction box, then locate the features along the edges of the box as
shown.
The Step by Step feature on the next page shows how to construct an
isometric drawing of an object composed of all “normal” surfaces. Normal
is used technically to mean “at right angles.” A normal surface is any
surface that is parallel to the sides of the box. Notice that all measurements
are made parallel to the main edges of the enclosing box—that is, parallel to
the isometric axes. No measurement along a nonisometric line can be
measured directly with the scale, as these lines are not foreshortenedequally to the normal lines. Start at any one of the corners of the bounding
box and draw along the isometric axis directions.
3.43 Isometric drawings are not typically dimensioned. When they are, the dimensions should
appear in the same plane as the isometric axes and read from the bottom of the sheet or aligned in
the isometric planes. (Courtesy of Brandon Wold.)Step by Step

3.12 Offset Location Measurements
Use the method shown in Figures 3.44a and b to locate points with respect
to each other. First, draw the main enclosing block, then draw the offset
lines (CA and BA) full size in the isometric drawing to locate corner A ofthe small block or rectangular recess. These measurements are called offset
measurements. Because they are parallel to edges of the main block in the
multiview drawings, they will be parallel to the same edges in the isometric
drawings (using the rule of parallelism).
3.44 Offset Location Measurements
Step by Step
Drawing Nonisometric LinesHow to Draw Nonisometric Lines
The inclined lines BA and CA are shown true length in the top view (54
mm), but they are not true length in the isometric view. To draw these lines
in the isometric drawing, use a construction box and offset measurements.
images Directly measure dimensions that are along isometric lines (in this
case, 44 mm, 18 mm, and 22 mm).images Because the 54 mm dimension is not along an isometric axis, it
cannot be used to locate point A.
Use trigonometry or draw a line parallel to the isometric axis to determine
the distance to point A.
Because this dimension is parallel to an isometric axis, it can be transferred
to the isometric.
images
images The dimensions 24 mm and 9 mm are parallel to isometric lines
and can be measured directly.
TipTo convince yourself that nonisometric lines will not be true length in the
isometric drawing, use a scrap of paper and mark the distance BA (Step 2)
and then compare it with BA on the given top view. Do the same for line
CA. You will see that BA is shorter and CA is longer in the isometric than
the corresponding lines in the given views.
Step by Step
Drawing Oblique Surfaces in Isometric
images
images Find the intersections of the oblique surfaces with the isometric
planes. Note that for this example, the oblique plane contains points A, B,
and C.
images
images To draw the plane, extend line AB to X and Y, in the same
isometric plane as C. Use lines XC and YC to locate points E and F.
imagesimages Draw AD and ED using the rule, “Parallel edges on a part will
appear parallel in any axonometric view.” Because the inclined surface is
planar and the surfaces it intersects are parallel to each other, the edges that
lie in those planes will also be parallel.
Isometric Drawings of Inclined Surfaces
Figure 3.45 shows how to construct an isometric drawing of an object that
has some inclined surfaces and oblique edges. Notice that inclined surfaces
are located by offset or coordinate measurements along the isometric lines.
For example, dimensions E and F are measured to locate the inclined
surface M, and dimensions A and B are used to locate surface N.
images images images
3.45 Inclined Surfaces in Isometric
3.13 Hidden Lines and Centerlines
Hidden lines in a drawing represent the edges where surfaces meet but are
not directly visible. Hidden lines are omitted from pictorial drawings unless
they are needed to make the drawing clear. Figure 3.46 shows a case in
which hidden lines are needed because a projecting part cannot be clearly
shown without them. Sometimes it is better to include an isometric viewfrom another direction than to try to show hidden features with hidden lines.
You will learn more about hidden lines in Chapter 6.
images
3.46 Using Hidden Lines
Draw centerlines locating the center of a hole only if they are needed to
indicate symmetry or for dimensioning. In general, use centerlines sparingly
in isometric drawings. If in doubt, leave them out, as too many centerlines
will look confusing.
3.14 Angles in Isometric
Angles project true size only when the plane containing the angle is parallel
to the plane of projection. An angle may project to appear larger or smaller
than the true angle depending on its position.
Because the various surfaces of the object are usually inclined to the front
plane of projection, they generally will not be projected true size in an
isometric drawing.
Step by Step
How to Draw Angles in IsometricThe multiview drawing at left shows three 60° angles. None of the three
angles will be 60° in the isometric drawing.
images
images Lightly draw an enclosing box using the given dimensions, except
for dimension X, which is not given.
images
images To find dimension X, draw triangle BDA from the top view full
size, as shown.
images
images Transfer dimension X to the isometric to complete the enclosing
box. Find dimension Y by a similar method and then transfer it to the
isometric.
imagesimages Complete the isometric by locating point E by using dimension K,
as shown. A regular protractor cannot be used to measure angles in
isometric drawings. Convert angular measurements to linear measurements
along isometric axis lines.
images
Tip
Checking Isometric Angles
To convince yourself that none of the angles will be 60°, measure each
angle in the isometric in the figure above with a protractor or scrap of
paper and note the angle compared with the true 60°. None of the angles
shown are the same in the isometric drawing. Two are smaller and one is
larger than 60°.
Estimating 30° Angles
If you are sketching on graph paper and estimating angles, an angle of 30°
is roughly a rise of 1 to a run of 2.
3.15 Irregular ObjectsYou can use the construction box method to draw objects that are not
rectangular (Figure 3.47). Locate the points of the triangular base by
offsetting a and b along the edges of the bottom of the construction box.
Locate the vertex by offsetting lines OA and OB using the top of the
construction box.
images images images
3.47 Irregular Object in Isometric
Tip
It is not always necessary to draw the complete construction box as shown
in Figure 3.47b. If only the bottom of the box is drawn, the triangular base
can be constructed as before. The orthographic projection of the vertex O’
on the base can be drawn using offsets O’A and O’B, as shown, and then
the vertical line O’O can be drawn, using measurement C.
3.16 Curves in Isometric
You can draw curves in isometric using a series of offset measurements
similar to those discussed in Section 3.12. Select any desired number of
points at random along the curve in the given top view, such as points A, B,
and C in Figure 3.48. Choose enough points to accurately locate the path of
the curve (the more points, the greater the accuracy). Draw offset grid linesfrom each point parallel to the isometric axes and use them to locate each
point in the isometric drawing as in the example shown in Figure 3.48.

3.17 True Ellipses in Isometric
If a circle lies in a plane that is not parallel to the plane of projection, the
circle projects as an ellipse. The ellipse can be constructed using offset
measurements.
Step by StepDrawing an Isometric Ellipse by Offset Measurements
Random-Line Method
images Draw parallel lines spaced at random across the circle.
images
images Transfer these lines to the isometric drawing. Where the hole exits
the bottom of the block, locate points by measuring down a distance equal
to the height d of the block from each of the upper points. Draw the ellipse,
part of which will be hidden, through these points. Darken the final drawing
lines.
images
Eight-Point Method
images Enclose the given circle in a square, and draw diagonals. Draw
another square through the points of intersection of the diagonals and the
circle as shown.
imagesimages Draw this same construction in the isometric, transferring
distances a and b. (If more points are desired, add random parallel lines, as
above.) The centerlines in the isometric are the conjugate diameters of the
ellipse. The 45° diagonals coincide with the major and minor axes of the
ellipse. The minor axis is equal in length to the sides of the inscribed
square.
images
images
When more accuracy is required, divide the circle into 12 equal parts, as
shown.
Nonisometric Lines
If a curve lies in a nonisometric plane, not all offset measurements can be
applied directly. The elliptical face shown in the auxiliary view lies in an
inclined nonisometric plane.
images Draw lines in the orthographic view to locate points.images Enclose the cylinder in a construction box and draw the box in the
isometric drawing. Draw the base using offset measurements, and construct
the inclined ellipse by locating points and drawing the final curve through
them.
images
Measure distances parallel to an isometric axis (a, b, etc.) in the isometric
drawing on each side of the centerline X–X. Project those not parallel to
any isometric axis (e, f, etc.) to the front view and down to the base, then
measure along the lower edge of the construction box, as shown.
images Darken final lines.
images3.18 Orienting Ellipses in Isometric Drawings
Figure 3.49 shows four-center ellipses constructed on the three visible faces
of a cube. Note that all the diagonals are horizontal or at 60° with
horizontal. Realizing this makes it easier to draw the shapes.
images
3.49 Four-Center Ellipses
Approximate ellipses such as these, constructed from four arcs, are accurate
enough for most isometric drawings. The four-center method can be used
only for ellipses in isometric planes. Earlier versions of CAD software, such
as AutoCAD Release 10, used this method to create the approximate
elliptical shapes available in the software. Current releases use an accurate
ellipse.
Step by Step
Drawing a Four-Center Ellipse
images Draw or imagine a square enclosing the circle in the multiview
drawing. Draw the isometric view of the square (an equilateral
parallelogram with sides equal to the diameter of the circle).images Mark the midpoint of each line and draw a perpendicular line
from each.
images
images Draw the two large arcs, with radius R, from the intersections of
the perpendiculars in the two closest corners of the parallelogram.
images
images Draw the two small arcs, with radius r, from the intersections of
the perpendiculars within the parallelogram, to complete the ellipse.
images
Tip
Here is a useful rule. The major axis of the ellipse is always at right angles
to the centerline of the cylinder, and the minor axis is at right angles to the
major axis and coincides with the centerline.images
Tip
As a check on the accurate location of these centers, you can draw a long
diagonal of the parallelogram as shown in Step 4. The midpoints of the
sides of the parallelogram are points of tangency for the four arcs.
More Accurate Ellipses
The four-center ellipse deviates considerably from a true ellipse. As shown
in Figure 3.50a, a four-center ellipse is somewhat shorter and “fatter” than a
true ellipse. When the four-center ellipse is not accurate enough, you can
use a closer approximation called the Orth four-center ellipse to produce a
more accurate drawing.3.50 Inaccuracy of the Four-Center Ellipse
Step by Step
Drawing an Orth Four-Center Ellipse
images
To create a more accurate approximate ellipse using the Orth method,
follow the steps for these methods. The centerline method is convenient
when starting from a hole or cylinder.
Centerline Methodimages Draw the isometric centerlines. From the center, draw a
construction circle equal to the actual diameter of the hole or cylinder. The
circle will intersect the centerlines at four points, A, B, C, and D.
images
images From the two intersection points on one centerline, draw
perpendiculars to the other centerline. Then draw perpendiculars from the
two intersection points on the other centerline to the first centerline.
images With the intersections of the perpendiculars as centers, draw two
small arcs and two large arcs.Enclosing-Rectangle Method
images Locate center of circle and block in enclosing isometric rectangle.
images
images Use the midpoint of the isometric rectangle (the distance from A
to B) to locate the foci on the major axis.
images Draw lines at 60° from horizontal through the foci (points C and
D) to locate the center of the large arc R.
images
images Draw the two large arcs R tangent to the isometric rectangle.
Draw two small arcs r, using foci points C and D as centers, to complete the
approximate ellipse.Note that these steps are exactly the same as for the regular four-center
ellipse, except for the use of the isometric centerlines instead of the
enclosing parallelogram. (When sketching, it works fine to just draw the
enclosing rectangle and sketch the arcs tangent to its sides.)
Tip
Isometric Templates
Special templates like this isometric template with angled lines and ellipses
oriented in various isometric planes make it easy to draw isometric
sketches. The ellipses are provided with markings to coincide with the
isometric centerlines of the holes—a convenient feature in isometric
drawing.
You can also draw ellipses using an ellipse template. Select the size and
alignment of the major and minor axes of the ellipse to match the
orientation of the shape in your drawing.images
3.19 Drawing Isometric Cylinders
A typical drawing with cylindrical shapes is shown in Figure 3.51. Note
that the centers of the larger ellipse cannot be used for the smaller ellipse,
though the ellipses represent concentric circles. Each ellipse has its own
parallelogram and its own centers. Notice that the centers of the lower large
ellipse are drawn by projecting the centers of the upper large ellipse down a
distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

3.51 Isometric Drawing of a Bearing
3.20 Screw Threads in IsometricParallel partial ellipses equally spaced at the symbolic thread pitch are used
to represent only the crests of a screw thread in isometric (Figure 3.52). The
ellipses may be sketched, drawn by the four-center method, or created using
an ellipse template.
3.52 Screw Threads in Isometric
3.21 Arcs in Isometric
The four-center ellipse construction can be used to sketch or draw circular
arcs in isometric. Figure 3.53a shows the complete construction. It is not
necessary to draw the complete constructions for arcs, as shown in Figures
3.53b and c. Measure the radius R from the construction corner, then at each
point, draw perpendiculars to the lines. Their intersection is the center of
the arc. Note that the R distances are equal in Figures 3.53b and c, but that
the actual radii used are quite different.3.53 Arcs in Isometric
3.22 Spheres in Isometric
The isometric drawing of any curved surface can be constructed from all
lines that can be drawn on that surface. For spheres, select the great circles
(circles cut by any plane through the center) as the lines on the surface.
Because all great circles, except those that are perpendicular or parallel to
the plane of projection, are shown as ellipses having equal major axes, they
enclose a circle whose diameter is the major axis of the ellipse.
Figure 3.54 shows two given views of a sphere enclosed in a construction
cube. Next, an isometric of a great circle is drawn in a plane parallel to one
face of the cube. There is no need to draw the ellipse, since only the points
on the diagonal located by measurements a are needed to establish the ends
of the major axis and thus to determine the radius of the sphere.3.54 Isometric of a Sphere
In the resulting isometric drawing, the diameter of the circle is √2/3 times
the actual diameter of the sphere. The isometric projection is simply a circle
whose diameter is equal to the true diameter of the sphere.
Step by Step
Isometric Sketching from an Object
Positioning the Object
images
To make an isometric sketch from an actual object, first hold the object in
your hand and tilt it toward you, as shown in the illustration. In this position
the front corner will appear vertical. The two receding bottom edges andthose edges parallel to them should appear to be at about 30° with
horizontal. The steps for sketching the object follow.
images Sketch the enclosing box lightly, making AB vertical and AC and
AD approximately 30° with horizontal. These three lines are the isometric
axes. Make AB, AC, and AD approximately proportional in length to the
actual corresponding edges on the object. Sketch the remaining lines
parallel to these three lines.
images Block in the recess and the projecting block.

images Darken all final lines.Cad at Work
Isometric Sketches Using Autocad Software
Need a quick isometric sketch? AutoCAD software has special drafting
settings for creating an isometric style grid.
Figure A shows the Drafting Settings dialog box in AutoCAD. When you
check the button for Isometric snap, the software calculates the spacing
needed for an isometric grid. You can use it to make quick pictorial
sketches like the example shown in Figure B. Piping diagrams are often
done this way, although they can also be created using 3D tools.
Even though the drawing in Figure B looks 3D, it is really drawn in a flat
2D plane. You can observe this if you change the viewpoint so you are no
longer looking straight onto the view.The Ellipse command in AutoCAD has a special Isocircle option that
makes drawing isometric ellipses easy. The isocircles are oriented in
different directions depending on the angle of the snap cursor. Figure C
shows isocircles and snap cursors for the three different orientations. In the
software, you press <Ctrl> and E simultaneously to toggle the cursor
appearance.

3.23 Oblique Sketches
Oblique drawing is an easy method for creating quick pictorials (Figure
3.55). In most oblique sketches, circles and angles parallel to the projection
plane are true size and shape and are therefore easy to construct. Although
circular shapes are easy to sketch in the front oblique plane, they would
appear elliptical in the top or sides. Oblique views are primarily a sketchingtechnique used when the majority of circular shapes appear in the front
view or when the object can be rotated to position circles in the front view.
images
3.55 Oblique Projection Theory
CAD is not typically used to create oblique views because better-appearing
isometric or perspective drawings can be created easily from 3D CAD
models.
Appearance of Oblique Drawings
Three things affect the appearance of your oblique sketch:
1. The surface of the object you choose to show parallel to the projection
plane
2. The angle and orientation you choose for the receding lines that depict
the object’s depth
3. The scale you choose for the receding lines depicting the object’s depth
(Figure 3.56)3.56 Angle of Receding Axis
images
Meat Cereals. Oblique sketching shows the front surface parallel to the view, making these meat
cereal boxes easy to draw. (Courtesy of Randall Munroe.)
Choosing the Front Surface
Think about which surface of the object would be the best one to think of as
parallel to the plane of projection. For example, a cube has six different
surfaces. As you are creating your sketch, any of those six surfaces could be
oriented as the “front” of the part. Of course, with a cube it wouldn’t matter
which one you chose. But a cube with a hole through it will make a much
better oblique sketch when the round hole is oriented parallel to the
projection plane.
Angle of Receding LinesAn angle of 45° is often chosen for the angle of the receding lines because it
makes oblique sketches quick and easy. You can use graph paper and draw
the angled lines through the diagonals of the grid boxes. An angle of 30° is
also a popular choice. It can look more realistic at times. Any angle can be
used, but 45° is typical. As shown in Figure 3.57, you can produce different
oblique drawings by choosing different directions for the receding lines.
3.57 Variation in Direction of Receding Axis
3.24 Length of Receding Lines
Theoretically, oblique projectors can be at any angle to the plane of
projection other than perpendicular or parallel. The difference in the angle
you choose causes receding lines of oblique drawings to vary in angle and
in length from near zero to near infinity. However, many of those choices
would not produce very useful drawings. Figure 3.58 shows a variety of
oblique drawings with different lengths for the receding lines.3.58 Foreshortening of Receding Lines
Because we see objects in perspective (where receding parallel lines appear
to converge) oblique projections look unnatural to us. The longer the object
in the receding direction, the more unnatural the object appears. For
example, the object shown in Figure 3.58a is an isometric drawing of a cube
in which the receding lines are shown full length. They appear to be too
long and they appear to widen toward the rear of the block. Figure 3.59b
shows how unnatural the familiar pictorial image of railroad tracks leading
off into the distance would look if drawn in an oblique projection. To give a
more natural appearance, show long objects with the long axis parallel to
the view, as shown in Figure 3.60.
images
3.59 Unnatural Appearance of Oblique Drawing
images
3.60 Long Axis Parallel to Plane of Projection
Cavalier ProjectionWhen the receding lines are true length—(the projectors make an angle of
45° with the plane of projection)—the oblique drawing is called a cavalier
projection (Figure 3.58a). Cavalier projections originated in the drawing of
medieval fortifications and were made on horizontal planes of projection.
On these fortifications the central portion was higher than the rest, so it was
called cavalier because of its dominating and commanding position.
Cabinet Projection
When the receding lines are drawn to half size (Figure 3.58d), the drawing
is known as a cabinet projection. This term is attributed to the early use of
this type of oblique drawing in the furniture industries. Figure 3.61 shows a
file drawer drawn in cavalier and cabinet projections.
images
3.61 Comparison of (a) Cavalier and (b) Cabinet Projections
3.25 Choice of Position in Oblique Drawings
Orient the view so that important shapes are parallel to the viewing plane,
as shown in Figure 3.62. In Figures 3.62a and c, the circles and circular arcs
are shown in their true shapes and are easy to draw. In Figures 3.62b and d
they are not shown in true shape and must be plotted as free curves or
ellipses.images
3.62 Essential Contours Parallel to Plane of Projection
3.26 Ellipses for Oblique Drawings
Circular shapes that are parallel to the front plane of projection appear as
circles in oblique view. In isometric views they appear elliptical. Figure
3.63 shows a comparison of a cylinder drawn in isometric and oblique
views.
images
3.63 Oblique and Isometric Projections for a Cylinder
It is not always possible to orient the view of an object so that all its
rounded shapes are parallel to the plane of projection. For example, the
object shown in Figure 3.64a has two sets of circular contours in different
planes. Both cannot be simultaneously placed parallel to the plane of
projection, so in the oblique projection, one of them must be viewed as an
ellipse.
images
3.64 Circles and Arcs Not Parallel to Plane of Projection
If you are sketching, you can just block in the enclosing rectangle and
sketch the ellipse tangent to its sides. Using CAD, you can draw the ellipse
by specifying its center and major and minor axes. In circumstances wherea CAD system is not available, if you need an accurate ellipse, you can
draw it by hand using a four-center arc approximation.
3.27 Angles in Oblique Projection
When an angle that is specified in degrees lies in a receding plane, convert
the angle into linear measurements to draw the angle in an oblique drawing.
Figure 3.65a shows a drawing with an angle of 30° specified.
images
3.65 Angles In Oblique Projection
To draw the angle in the oblique drawing, you will need to know distance
X. The distance from point A to point B is given as 32 mm. This can be
measured directly in the cavalier drawing (Figure 3.65b). Find distance X
by drawing the right triangle ABC (Figure 3.65c) using the dimensions
given, which is quick and easy using CAD.
You can also use a mathematical solution to find the length of the side: The
length of the opposite side equals the tangent of the angle times the length
of the adjacent side. In this case, the length of the opposite side, X, is about
18.5 mm. Draw the angle in the cavalier drawing using the found distance.
Remember that all receding dimensions must be reduced to match the scale
of the receding axis. In the cabinet drawing in Figure 3.65c, the distance BC
must be half the side BC of the right triangle in Figure 3.65c.Step by Step

3.28 Sketching Assemblies
Assembly drawings are used to show how parts fit together. Because they
do not need to provide all the information to make individual parts,
isometric sketches or drawings are often used that show only the exterior
view of the assembled parts. You can use assembly sketches as you design
to identify areas that must fit together or have common dimensions, or to
maintain critical distances to ensure that the device will function as
expected. Figure 3.66 shows an isometric sketch of an assembly.
images
3.66 Isometric Assembly SketchSketched assembly drawings are useful in documenting your ideas in a
rougher state. An exploded isometric assembly drawing shows the
individual parts moved apart from one another along the isometric axis line
directions. A centerline pattern is used to show how the parts relate and fit
together.
When creating an exploded assembly sketch, keep the parts lined up with
the other parts where they assemble. If possible, move any single parts
along only one axis direction. In Figure 3.67, all exploded parts are moved
along only one axis direction. Notice the centerline pattern showing how
the parts align. If you must move a part in two different directions so that it
can be seen clearly, add a centerline showing how the part must move to get
to its proper location in the assembly. In Figure 3.68, parts have been
moved in two axis directions. You can see the jog in the centerline
indicating how the part has been moved.
3.67 Exploded Isometric Assembly Sketch. Centerlines have been added to show where parts line
up in the assembly.images
3.68 Isometric Assembly Sketch. Some parts have been exploded in two directions so they do not
overlap other parts in the assembly. The centerlines indicate the path the part must follow to
assemble correctly. (Courtesy of Albert W. Brown, Jr.)
Finished assembly drawings that will be given to manufacturing workers to
show them how to produce a device also contain a parts list that identifies
each part in the assembly, the quantity necessary, the material of each part,
and a number identifying which item it is on the drawing. A parts list can
also be included on a sketched assembly drawing. Sometimes it is helpful to
give a quick assembly sketch to manufacturing along with part drawings,
especially if they are parts you need to have manufactured quickly from a
sketch. Seeing how the parts fit together in assembly will help the
manufacturer understand the entire device and identify potential problems.
3.29 Sketching Perspectives
Perspective pictorials most closely approximate the view produced by the
human eye. Perspective views are the type of drawing most like a
photograph. Examples of a perspective drawing can be seen in Figures 3.69,
3.70a, and 3.72. Although complex perspective views are time consuming
to sketch, they are easy to create from 3D CAD models.

3.73 Three-Point Perspective
Unlike parallel types of projection, perspective projectors converge. The
point at which the projectors converge is called the vanishing point. This is
clearly seen in Figure 3.70a.
The first rule of perspective is that all parallel lines that are not parallel to
the picture plane vanish at a single vanishing point, and if these lines are
parallel to the ground, the vanishing point will be on the horizon. Parallel
lines that are also parallel to the picture plane remain parallel and do not
converge toward a vanishing point (Figures 3.71 and 3.72).
When the vanishing point is placed above the view of the object in the
picture plane, the result is a bird’s-eye view, looking down onto the object.
When the vanishing point is placed below the view of the object, the resultis a worm’s-eye view looking up at the object from below (see Figure 3.74
on page 107).
images
3.74 (a) Object below the Horizon Line; (b) Object above the Horizon Line
There are three types of perspective: one-point, two-point, and three-point
perspective, depending on the number of vanishing points used.
The Three Types of Perspective
Perspective drawings are classified according to the number of vanishing
points required, which in turn depends on the position of the object with
respect to the picture plane.
If the object sits with one face parallel to the plane of projection, only one
vanishing point is required. The result is a one-point perspective, or
parallel perspective.
If the object sits at an angle with the picture plane but with vertical edges
parallel to the picture plane, two vanishing points are required, and the
result is a two-point perspective, or an angular perspective. This is the most
common type of perspective drawing.
If the object sits so that no system of parallel edges is parallel to the picture
plane, three vanishing points are necessary, and the result is a three-pointperspective.
One-Point Perspective
To sketch a one-point perspective view, orient the object so that a principal
face is parallel to the picture plane. If desired, this face can be placed in the
picture plane. The other principal face is perpendicular to the picture plane,
and its lines will converge toward a single vanishing point.

Step by Step
One-Point Perspective
To sketch the bearing in one-point perspective—that is, with one vanishing
point—follow the steps illustrated below.
images Sketch the true front face of the object, just as in oblique
sketching. Select the vanishing point for the receding lines. In many cases it
is desirable to place the vanishing point above and to the right of the
picture, as shown, although it can be placed anywhere in the sketch.
However, if the vanishing point is placed too close to the center, the lines
will converge too sharply and the picture will be distorted.images
images Sketch the receding lines toward the vanishing point.
images
images Estimate the depth to look good and sketch in the back portion of
the object. Note that the back circle and arc will be slightly smaller than the
front circle and arc.
images
images Darken all final lines. Note the similarity between the perspective
sketch and the oblique sketch earlier in the chapter.
images
Two-Point Perspective
Two-point perspective is more true to life than one-point perspective. To
sketch a two-point perspective, orient the object so that principal edges are
vertical and therefore have no vanishing point; edges in the other two
directions have vanishing points. Two-point perspective is especially goodfor representing buildings and large civil structures, such as dams or
bridges.
Step by Step
Two-Point Perspective
To sketch a desk using two vanishing points, follow these steps.
images Sketch the front corner of the desk at true height. Locate two
vanishing points (VPL and VPR) on a horizon line (at eye level). Distance
CA may vary—the greater it is, the higher the eye level will be and the
more we will be looking down on top of the object. A rule of thumb is to
make C–VPL one third to one fourth of C–VPR.
images
images Estimate depth and width, and sketch the enclosing box.
images
images Block in all details. Note that all parallel lines converge toward
the same vanishing point.
imagesimages Darken all final lines. Make the outlines thicker and the inside
lines thinner, especially where they are close together.
images
Three-Point Perspective
In three-point perspective, the object is placed so that none of its principal
edges is parallel to the picture plane. Each of the three sets of parallel edges
has a separate vanishing point. See Figure 3.73.
Bird’s-Eye View versus Worm’s-Eye View
The appearance of a perspective sketch depends on your viewpoint in
relation to the object. Select some reachable object in the room and move so
that you are looking at it from above and really notice its shape. Now
gradually move so that you are looking at it from below. Notice how the
change of viewpoint changes the appearance of its surfaces—which ones
are visible and their relative size.
The horizon line in a perspective sketch is a horizontal line that represents
the eye level of the observer. Locating the sketched object below the
horizon line produces a view from above (or a bird’s-eye view). Locating
the sketched object above the horizon line produces a view from below (ora worm’s-eye view). Figure 3.74 illustrates the horizon line in a drawing
and the effect of placing the object above or below the horizon line.
3.30 Curves and Circles in Perspective
If a circle is parallel to the picture plane, its perspective view is a circle. If
the circle is inclined to the picture plane, its perspective drawing may be
any one of the conic sections in which the base of the cone is the given
circle, the vertex is the station point, and the cutting plane is the picture
plane (see Figure 3.71). The centerline of the cone of rays is usually
approximately perpendicular to the picture plane, so the perspective will
usually be an ellipse.
An ellipse may be drawn using a method of blocking in its center and a box
tangent to the ellipse as shown in Figure 3.75. Also shown is a convenient
method for determining the perspective of any planar curve.
images
3.75 Blocking in Curves in Two-Point Perspective
3.31 Shading
Shading can make it easier to visualize pictorial drawings, such as display
drawings, patent drawings, and catalog drawings. Ordinary multiview and
assembly drawings are not shaded. The shading should be simple,
reproduce well, and produce a clear picture. Some of the common types ofshading are shown in Figure 3.76. Two methods of shading fillets and
rounds are shown in Figures 3.76c and d. Shading produced with dots is
shown in Figure 3.76e, and pencil tone shading is shown in Figure 3.76f.
Pencil tone shading used in pictorial drawings on tracing paper reproduces
well only when making blueprints, not when using a copier.
images
3.76 Methods of Shading
3.32 Computer Graphics
Pictorial drawings of all types can be created using 3D CAD (Figures 3.77
and 3.78). To create pictorials using 2D CAD, use projection techniques
similar to those presented in this chapter. The advantage of 3D CAD is that
once you make a 3D model of a part or assembly, you can change the
viewing direction at any time for orthographic, isometric, or perspective
views. You can also apply different materials to the drawing objects and
shade them to produce a high degree of realism in the pictorial view.

3.33 Drawing on DrawingBecause CAD helps people produce accurate drawings that are easy to alter,
store, and repurpose, computer automation has made the painstaking
aspects of hand-rendering technical drawings nearly obsolete. Still, the
ability to sketch with clarity is an immediate and universal way to record
and communicate ideas.
The ability to think of complex objects in terms of their basic solid
components and to identify relationships between various surfaces, edges,
and vertices is basic to creating both hand-drawn (Figure 3.79) and
computer-generated technical drawings. By understanding how to represent
objects accurately, you can communicate efficiently as part of a team and
increase your constructive visualization ability, or your ability to “think
around corners.”

Sketching at Work
“… I want to be able to draw any kind of line I want.”
Jacob Baron-Taltre works as a product designer for a midsize furniture
manufacturer in the Seattle region. He sketches nearly every day at work.
“Sometimes the sketches are very loose … just tools for me to work out
some detail that I am designing. Other times they are more elaborate andcrisp because they will likely be part of a conversation or presentation.”
A computer is not the first tool he reaches for when beginning a project.
“Scribbling notes or quick sketches on paper is the fastest way to document
the most ideas in the least time. Later, I’ll develop some of those ideas more
fully by hand and only then begin to use the computer to document the
concepts as 2D or 3D CAD work. If I can’t draw an idea by hand, I won’t
likely have more success (if any) using CAD.”
Baron-Taltre said he sketches to explore various forms, sizes, and materials.
“CAD is more precise and that precision can be somewhat limiting. When I
want to draw a line I want to be able to draw any kind of line I want. In
CAD, I have to use a specific tool for each line type.”
“CAD is a great way to communicate finished thoughts and explore precise
relationships. It’s also great for quickly building accurate environments and
models that can be rotated and examined. You can share these files and edit
without having to redraw. Drawing by hand is faster for depicting specific
ideas and can be used to communicate with someone in front of you. Plus,
you can add detail to key areas of the drawing and leave out detail in areas
needed only for context.”
Cad at WorkSketching and Parametric Modeling
The Design Process
The parametric modeling process in many ways mirrors the design process.
Parametric CAD software lets you specify geometry, dimensions, and other
essential parameters that control the model. To get the rough ideas down,
the designer starts by making hand sketches. Then as the ideas are refined,
more accurate drawings are created either with instruments or using CAD.
Necessary analysis is performed and, in response, the design may change.
The drawings are revised as needed to meet the new requirements.
Eventually the drawings are approved so that the parts may be
manufactured.
Rough Sketches
Using parametric modeling software, the designer first roughly sketches the
basic shapes on the computer screen as though sketching freehand. These
sketches do not need to have perfectly straight lines or accurate corners.
The software interprets the sketch much as you would interpret a rough
sketch given to you by a colleague. If the lines are nearly horizontal or
vertical, the software assumes that you meant them to be so. If the line
appears to be perpendicular, the software assumes that it is.
Constraining the SketchUsing a parametric CAD system, you next refine the two-dimensional
sketch by adding geometric constraints, which tell how to interpret the
sketch, and by adding parametric dimensions, which control the size of
sketch geometry. Once the sketch is refined, you can create it as a 3D
feature to which other features can be added. As the design changes, you
can change the dimensions and constraints that control the sketch geometry,
and the parametric model will be updated to reflect the new design.
When you are creating sketches by hand or for parametric modeling, think
about the implications of the geometry you are drawing. Does the sketch
imply that lines are perpendicular? Are the arcs that you have drawn
intended to be tangent or intersecting? When you create a parametric
model, the software applies rules to constrain the geometry, based on your
sketch. You can remove, change, or add new constraints, but to use the
software effectively you need to accurately depict the geometry you want
formed.

Cad at WorkPerspective Views in Autocad
AutoCAD software provides options for parallel and perspective viewing.
You can use the menu for the ViewCube to quickly select Parallel or
Perspective viewing options (Figure A). The defaults for perspective
viewing determine the basic appearance when you select the perpective
view types. Notice that the grid squares in the figure appear larger closer to
the view and smaller when they are farther away. When parallel projection
is selected, the grid lines remain parallel.
An interactive command, Dview (dynamic viewing), lets you show 3D
models and drawings in perspective (or parallel view) and interactively
change the viewing options. Dview uses a camera and target analogy to
create perspective views. Using the Camera option, you select a camera
position (similar to the station point) with respect to the target point at
which the camera is aimed. The Dview Distance option lets you change the
distance between the camera and the object and calculate a new view. The
Off option of the command turns perspective viewing off to return to a
parallel view.
Specifying a distance that is too close can fill up the entire view with the
object, in the same way that a close-up shot with a camera does.
The Zoom option of the Dview command acts like a normal zoom
command when perspective viewing is off. When perspective viewing is on,you can zoom dynamically by moving the slider bar shown in Figure B to
adjust the camera lens to change the field of view. The default is to show
the view similar to what you would see through a camera with a 50 mm
lens. During the Zoom option, moving the slider is similar to choosing the
focal length for a camera lens, which changes the relative perspective
appearance (Figure B). Shorter focal lengths exaggerate the perspective
effect of closer features.

Industry Case
Sketching for Ideation: A CrossAction Breakthrough
When Oral-B hired LUNAR to create an innovative approach to brushing
(and a new flagship product), they had no preconceived notions of what that
would mean. But they knew that they wanted a brush that was
ergonomically superior to the traditional “flat stick” design, and they
wanted the brush to improve brushing effectiveness. The development ofthe Oral-B CrossAction Toothbrush is an example of the power of ideation
in product design.
Jeff Salazar, lead designer for the project, started first not with sketches but
with extensive research into the kinesiology of brushing teeth. A research
firm had been hired to do a study of how people hold their toothbrushes as
they brush. They found that there are five basic grips. Each person might
use more than one depending on the part of the mouth to be brushed. Two
or three grips were the ones used by most people.
As the kinesiology study was underway, the design team at LUNAR
undertook their own study of brushing. Given that the design constraints
were focused almost totally on ergonomics, they studied how people brush.
They engaged team members and others and watched them brush. They
used models of teeth to investigate brushing. They bought “flat stick”
toothbrushes, heated them so they could be bent at different angles, and had
a variety of people report back on their brushing experience with handles of
different shapes. People of various sizes and backgrounds, male and female,
were asked to brush with the angled handles. This helped them understand
the extremes of the angles forward and back that the handle could form.
images
They also studied the competition. A competitor had come out with what it
promised was a superior toothbrush—one that was “bent like a dentalinstrument.” After trying the toothbrush, however, the team concluded that
the shape was only superior if someone else (e.g., the dental hygienist) was
brushing your teeth. This key insight helped them focus the next stage of
ideation on shapes with potential.
After discussing their results, the team selected five to six angle
configurations for further study. The ergonomic results of the team’s efforts
were an instinct that people wanted a toothbrush that would “fill the hand”
more than the thin stick. But where should the brush be thicker? The team
created a matrix that paired each of the angle configurations with the range
of options for the handles’ thickness (Figure 3.80). Then, Jeff began
sketching all the various combinations (see Figure 3.81).
images
3.80 The Matrix Used to Drive Concept Generation
images images images images
3.81 Sketches and Notes on the Concept as It Was Developed
After about a week of generating pencil sketches, Jeff decided he needed to
“sketch” in 3D. Starting with a full-size sketch (Figure 3.82), he used a
band saw to cut the shape of the sketch in foam, then shaped the foam into a
model that he and others could hold and evaluate for various grips (Figure
3.83). Those that didn’t work for one grip or another were eliminated. TheLUNAR team and their counterparts at Oral-B reviewed the various options
and selected four for further development.
images images images images images images images
images
3.82 Full-Size Sketches Used to Create the Foam “3D Sketches”
images
3.83 Foam Models Used as 3D Sketches
At this point, the team created 3D models of the four candidates. Oral-B
had prototypes made from the CAD models for the handles (Figure 3.84),
added bristles, and embarked on consumer research that would drive the
next stage of refinement. Consumers were asked to brush for one month,
then attend a focus group to report on their experience. LUNAR Design was
present to hear consumer reactions.
images
3.84 Prototypes Generated from the 3D Model
What they found was that consumers loved the fatter handle. Its shape in
the hand gave them more control when moving the brush to different parts
of their mouth. The form provided optimal ergonomics for each of the five
common grips. The faceted surface on the handle gave users a tactile clue
as to where to place their fingers when gripping. The rubberlike materialused for the facets was located where users exerted the most finger pressure
—and it made it easier to hold the brush when wet. The very positive
response indicated that the ergonomic handle could make a significant
difference in brushing that consumers would appreciate. People reported
that they loved their toothbrush now!
At the same time, Jeff and the LUNAR and Oral-B teams had to listen and
interpret what they heard. Focus groups are a wealth of different reactions,
and it is up to the team to determine what is relevant and what is peripheral.
For example, one reaction was that the fatter handle did not fit in the
standard toothbrush holder. The team had to assess whether this was an
issue that would hamper acceptance of the toothbrush or whether the
improved brushing experience would outweigh its importance to the
customer.
The refinement of the design proceeded through two more prototypes (and
additional ideation around packaging; see Figure 3.85) before the final
Oral-B CrossAction was launched. The intensity of the ideation stage—and
the many techniques used to generate and evaluate design ideas—were
critical to the team’s success in achieving this breakthrough in brushing.

Sketch for a Composting Latrine. The student chapter of Engineers Without Borders at Montana
State University is collaborating with 57 schools in the Khwisero Division of southwestern Kenya to
provide sustainable sanitary improvements including wells and composting latrines. (Sketch courtesy of
Andrea Orr, Engineers Without Borders, MSU.)
Andrea Orr was a student in environment design at Montana State
University and a co-fundraiser and co-project designer in the MSU chapter
of Engineers Without Borders.
She created the sketch above during the building of a composting latrine
that she and Chris Allen designed for a school in the Khwisero Division of
southwestern Kenya. The sketch showed instructors and local government
officials how the latrine would work.
Though they had done multiple sketches ahead of time, she and Allen did
this sketch to clarify their ideas into one concept.
Orr did the sketch outdoors, sitting next to the school building. There was
no computer available, because at the remote location, electricity was rarely
available. She also did a drawing explaining how to use and maintain the
latrine, which was posted inside the finished structure.
Orr said that when she is not working in the field, she still sketches by hand
before transferring to CAD.“There’s little bit of vagueness in a hand-drawn sketch that keeps it open to
creativity,” said Orr.
“If you show a sketch to someone they are more likely to offer input and
ideas than if it looks like a finished CAD rendering. That’s one of the
reasons I don’t work in CAD until quite a few revisions into the project.”

Chapter Summary
Sketching is a quick way of visualizing and solving a drawing problem.
It is an effective way of communicating with all members of the design
team.
Three-dimensional figures are bounded by surfaces that are either planar,
single-curved, double-curved, or warped.
Prisms, pyramids, cylinders, cones, tori, and ellipsoids are common
shapes in engineering drawings. There are also five regular polyhedra:
the tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and
icosahedron.
There are special techniques for sketching lines, circles, and arcs. These
techniques should be practiced so they become second nature.
Using a grid makes sketching in proportion an easy task.
Circles can be sketched by constructing a square and locating the four
tangent points where the circle touches the square.A sketched line does not need to look like a CAD or mechanical line.
The main distinction between CAD and instrumental drawing and
freehand sketching is the character or technique of the line work.
Freehand sketches are made to proportion, but not necessarily to a
particular scale.
Sketching is one of the most important skills for accurately recording
ideas.
Isometric, oblique, and perspective are three methods used to create
pictorial sketches.

Geometry for Modeling and Design
Objectives
After studying the material in this chapter, you should be able to:
1. Identify and specify basic geometric elements and primitive shapes.
2. Select a 2D profile that best describes the shape of an object.
3. Identify mirrored shapes and sketch their lines of symmetry.
4. Identify shapes that can be formed by extrusion and sketch their cross sections.
5. Identify shapes that can be formed by revolution techniques and sketch their profiles.
6. Define Boolean operations.
7. Specify the Boolean operations to combine primitive shapes into a complex shape.
8. Work with Cartesian coordinates and user coordinate systems in a CAD system.
9. Identify the transformations common to CAD systems.
Additional geometric constructions are located in Appendix 52.Many different geometric shapes were used to model this jetboard. The wireframe view of the top cover reveals several
regular geometric shapes used to model the interior components. The graceful lines of the outer hull are defined by the
irregular curves used to model it. (Courtesy of Leo Greene, www.e-Cognition.net.)
Overview
Engineering drawings combine basic geometric shapes and relationships to define complex
objects. 2D drawings are composed of simple entities such as points, lines, arcs, and circles, as
well as more complex entities such as ellipses and curves. Reviewing the basic geometry of
these elements helps you define and combine these elements in your drawings and CAD
models.
Accurate construction is critical to creating useful drawings. Lines drawn using a CAD system
are highly accurate definitions—much greater than you can see on a computer monitor. Good
manual drawing technique can typically produce a drawing accurate to about 1/40th of the
drawing scale. For example, a hand-drawn survey created at 1′′= 400′ might be accurate to arange of plus or minus 10′. The internal precision of drawings created using CAD systems is
limited by the 64 bits (base-2 places) typically used to represent decimal numbers in a CAD
system. This produces a theoretical accuracy of around 1 in 10 quadrillion (10 ). If you drew
two beams, each three times the distance from the Sun to Pluto, and made one of the beams
just 1 mm longer than the other one, a CAD system could still accurately represent the
difference between the two beams. Wow! That’s a lot better than the 1 in 40 accuracy of a
manual drawing. However, CAD drawings are accurate only if the drawing geometry is
defined accurately when the drawing is created.
Coordinates for 3D Cad Modeling
2D and 3D CAD drawing entities are stored in relationship to a Cartesian coordinate system.
No matter what CAD software system you will be using, it is helpful to understand some basic
similarities of coordinate systems.
Most CAD systems use the right-hand rule for coordinate systems; if you point the thumb of
your right hand in the positive direction for the X-axis and your index finger in the positive
direction for the Y-axis, your remaining fingers will curl in the positive direction for the Z-axis
(shown in Figure 4.1). When the face of your monitor is the X-Y plane, the Z-axis is pointing
toward you (see Figure 4.2).
4.1 Right-Hand Rule
164.2 The Z-Axis. In systems that use the right-hand rule, the positive Z-axis points toward you when the face of the monitor is
parallel to the X-Y plane.
The right-hand rule is also used to determine the direction of rotation. For rotation using the
right-hand rule, point your thumb in the positive direction along the axis of rotation. Your
fingers will curl in the positive direction for the rotation, as shown in Figure 4.3.
4.3 Axis of Rotation. The curl of the fingers indicates the positive direction along the axis of rotation.
Though rare, some CAD systems use a left-hand rule. In this case, the curl of the fingers on
your left hand gives you the positive direction for the Z-axis. In this case, when the face of
your computer monitor is the X-Y plane, the positive direction for the Z-axis extends into your
computer monitor, not toward you.
A 2D CAD system uses only the X- and Y-coordinates of the Cartesian coordinate system. 3D
CAD systems use X, Y, and Z. To represent 2D in a 3D CAD system, the view is straight
down the Z-axis. Figure 4.4 shows a drawing created using only the X- and Y- values, leaving
the Z-coordinates set to 0, to produce a 2D drawing.4.4 2D CAD Drawing. This drawing was created on the X-Y plane in the CAD system. It appears true shape because the
viewing direction is perpendicular to the X-Y plane—straight down the Z-axis.
Recall that each orthographic view shows only two of the three coordinate directions because
the view is straight down one axis. 2D CAD drawings are the same: They show only the X￾and Y-coordinates because you are looking straight down the Z-axis.
When the X-Y plane is aligned with the screen in a CAD system, the Z-axis is oriented
horizontally. In machining and many other applications, the Z-axis is considered to be the
vertical axis. In all cases, the coordinate axes are mutually perpendicular and oriented
according to the right-hand or left-hand rule. Because the view can be rotated to be straight
down any axis or any other direction, understanding how to use coordinates in the model is
more important than visualizing the direction of the default axes and planes.
The vertices of the 3D shape shown in Figure 4.5 are identified by their X-, Y-, and Z￾coordinates. Often, it is useful when modeling parts to locate the origin of the coordinate
system at the lower left of the part, as shown in Figure 4.5. This location for the (0,0,0) point
on a part is useful when the part is being machined, as it then makes all coordinates on the part
positive (Figure 4.6). Some older numerically-controlled machinery will not interpret a filecorrectly if it has negative lengths or coordinates. CAD models are often exported to other
systems for manufacturing parts, so try to create them in a common and useful way.
4.5 3D Coordinates for Vertices
4.6 This CAD model for a plate with 6 holes has its origin (0,0,0) at the back left of the part when it is set up for
numerically-controlled machining. (Courtesy of Matt McCune, Autopilot, Inc.)
Specifying LocationEven though the model is ultimately stored in a single Cartesian coordinate system, you may
usually specify the location of features using other location methods as well. The most typical
of these are relative, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. These coordinate formats
are useful for specifying locations to define your CAD drawing geometry.

The First Coordinate System
René Descartes (1596–1650) was the French philosopher and mathematician for whom the
Cartesian coordinate system is named. Descartes linked algebra and geometry to classify
curves by the equations that describe them. His coordinate system remains the most
commonly used coordinate system today for identifying points. A 2D coordinate system
consists of a pair of lines, called the X- and Y-axes, drawn on a plane so that they intersect atright angles. The point of intersection is called the origin. A 3D coordinate system adds a third
axis, referred to as the Z-axis, that is perpendicular to the two other axes. Each point in space
can be described by numbers, called coordinates, that represent its distance from this set of
axes. The Cartesian coordinate system made it possible to represent geometric entities by
numerical and algebraic expressions. For example, a straight line is represented by a linear
equation in the form ax + by + c = 0, where the x- and y-variables represent the X- and Y￾coordinates for each point on the line. Descartes’ work laid the foundation for the problem￾solving methods of analytic geometry and was the first significant advance in geometry since
those of the ancient Greeks.
Absolute Coordinates
Absolute coordinates are used to store the locations of points in a CAD database. These
coordinates specify location in terms of distance from the origin in each of the three axis
directions of the Cartesian coordinate system.
Think of giving someone directions to your house (or to a house in an area where the streets
are laid out in rectangular blocks). One way to describe how to get to your house would be to
tell the person how many blocks over and how many blocks up it is from two main streets
(and how many floors up in the building, for 3D). The two main streets are like the X- and Y￾axes of the Cartesian coordinate system, with the intersection as the origin. Figure 4.8 shows
how you might locate a house with this type of absolute coordinate system.4.8 Absolute coordinates define a location in terms of distance from the origin (0,0,0), shown here as a star. These directions
are useful because they do not change unless the origin changes.
Relative Coordinates
Instead of having to specify each location from the origin, you can use relative coordinates to
specify a location by giving the number of units from a previous location. In other words, the
location is defined relative to your previous location.
To understand relative coordinates, think about giving someone directions from his or her
current position, not from two main streets. Figure 4.9 shows the same map again, but this
time with the location of the house relative to the location of the person receiving directions.4.9 Relative coordinates describe the location in terms of distance from a starting point. Relative coordinates to the same
location differ according to the starting location.
Polar Coordinates
Polar coordinates are used to locate an object by giving an angle (from the X-axis) and a
distance. Polar coordinates can either be absolute, giving the angle and distance from the
origin, or relative, giving the angle and distance from the current location.
Picture the same situation of having to give directions. You could tell the person to walk at a
specified angle from the crossing of the two main streets, and how far to walk. Figure 4.10
shows the angle and direction for the shortcut across the empty lot using absolute polar
coordinates. You could also give directions as an angle and distance relative to a starting point.4.10 Polar coordinates describe the location using an angle and distance from the origin (absolute) or starting point
(relative).
Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates
Cylindrical and spherical coordinates are similar to polar coordinates except that a 3D location
is specified instead of one on a single flat plane (such as a map).
Cylindrical coordinates specify a 3D location based on a radius, angle, and distance (usually
in the Z-axis direction). This gives a location as though it were on the edge of a cylinder. The
radius tells how far the point is from the center (or origin); the angle is the angle from the X￾axis along which the point is located; and the distance provides the height where the point is
located on the cylinder. Cylindrical coordinates are similar to polar coordinates, but they add
distance in the Z-direction. Figure 4.11a depicts relative cylindrical coordinates used to
specify a location, where the starting point serves as the center of the cylinder.4.11 Relative Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates. The target points in (a) and (b) are described by relative coordinates
from the starting point (3,2,0). Although the paths to the point differ, the resulting endpoint is the same.
Spherical coordinates specify a 3D location by the radius, an angle from the X-axis, and the
angle from the X-Y plane. These coordinates locate a point on a sphere, where the origin of
the coordinate system is at the center of the sphere. The radius gives the size of the sphere; the
angle from the X-axis locates a place on the equator. The second angle gives the location from
the plane of the equator to a point on the sphere in line with the location specified on the
equator. Figure 4.11b depicts relative spherical coordinates, where the starting point serves as
the center of the sphere.
Even though you may use these different systems to enter information into your 3D drawings,
the end result is stored using one set of Cartesian coordinates.
Using Existing Geometry to Specify Location
Most CAD packages offer a means of specifying location by specifying the relationship of a
point to existing objects in the model or drawing. For example, AutoCAD’s “object snap”
feature lets you enter a location by “snapping” to the endpoint of a line, the center of a circle,
the intersection of two lines, and so on (Figure 4.12). Using existing geometry to locate new
entities is faster than entering coordinates. This feature also allows you to capture geometricrelationships between objects without calculating the exact location of a point. For example,
you can snap to the midpoint of a line or the nearest point of tangency on a circle. The
software calculates the exact location.
4.12 Object snaps are aids for selecting locations on existing CAD drawing geometry. (Autodesk screen shots reprinted courtesy of
Autodesk, Inc.)
Geometric Entities
PointsPoints are geometric constructs. Points are considered to have no width, height, or
depth. They are used to indicate locations in space. In CAD drawings, a point is located by its
coordinates and usually shown with some sort of marker like a cross, circle, or other
representation. Many CAD systems allow you to choose the style and size of the mark that is
used to represent points.
Most CAD systems offer three ways to specify a point:
Type in the coordinates (of any kind) for the point (see Figure 4.13).
4.13 Specifying Points. Point 1 was added to the drawing by typing the absolute coordinates 3,4,7. Point 2 was added
relative to Point 1 with the relative coordinates @2,2,2.
Pick a point from the screen with a pointing device (mouse or tablet).
Specify the location of a point by its relationship to existing geometry (e.g., an endpoint of
a line, an intersection of two lines, or a center point).
Picking a point from the screen is a quick way to enter points when the exact location is not
important, but the accuracy of the CAD database makes it impossible to enter a location
accurately in this way.
LinesA straight line is defined as the shortest distance between two points. Geometrically, a line has
length but no other dimension such as width or thickness. Lines are used in drawings to
represent the edge view of a surface, the limiting element of a contoured surface, or the edge
formed where two surfaces on an object join. In a CAD database, lines are typically stored by
the coordinates of their endpoints.
For the lines shown in Figure 4.14, the table below shows how you can specify the second
endpoint for a particular type of coordinate entry. (For either or both endpoints, you can also
snap to existing geometry without entering any coordinates.)
4.14 Specifying Lines. (a) This 2D line was drawn from endpoint (3,2) to (6,6). (b) This 3D line was drawn from endpoint
(3,2,0) to (5,4,6).
PlanesPlanes are defined by any of the following (see Figure 4.15):
4.15 Defining a Plane. The highlighted entities in each image define a plane.
Three points not lying in a straight line
Two parallel lines
Two intersecting lines
A point and a line
The last three ways to define a plane are all special cases of the more general case—three
points not in a straight line. Knowing what can determine a plane can help you understand the
geometry of solid objects and use the geometry as you model in CAD.
For example, a face on an object is a plane that extends between the vertices and edges of the
surface. Most CAD programs allow you to align new entities with an existing plane. You can
use any face on the object—whether it is normal, inclined, or oblique—to define a plane for
aligning a new entity.
Defining planes on the object or in 3D space is an important skill for working in 3D CAD.
The software provides tools for defining new planes (see Figure 4.16). The options for these
tools are based on the geometry of planes, as defined in the preceding list. Typical choices
allow the use of any three points not in a line, two parallel lines, two intersecting lines, a point
and a line, or being parallel to, perpendicular to, or at an angle from an existing plane.4.16 Defining a Plane in CAD. A point and a line (the edge between two surfaces in this case) were used to define a plane in
this Pro/ENGINEER model.
A plane may serve as a coordinate-system orientation that shows a surface true shape. You
will learn more about orienting work planes to take advantage of the object’s geometry later in
this chapter.
Circles
A circle is a set of points that are equidistant from a center point. The distance from the center
to one of the points is the radius (see Figure 4.17). The distance across the center to any two
points on opposite sides is the diameter. The circumference of a circle contains 360° of arc. In
a CAD file, a circle is often stored as a center point and a radius.4.17 The Circle

4.2 Drawing Tangents to Two Circles
When drawing entities tangent to a circle, there are two locations that satisfy the condition of
tangency. When using a CAD system, select a point close to the tangent location you intend.
4.23 Drawing Tangents to Two Circles
4.24 Tangency constraints for two identical sets of circles are shown in AutoCAD.
4.3 Drawing an Arc Tangent to a Line or Arc and through a PointGiven line AB, point P, and radius R (Figure 4.25a), draw line DE parallel to the given line and
distance R from it. From P draw an arc with radius R, cutting line DE at C, the center of the
required tangent arc.
4.25 Tangents. These are often easy constructions using CAD and object snaps.
Given line AB, with tangent point Q on the line and point P (Figure 4.25b), draw PQ, which
will be a chord of the required arc. Draw perpendicular bisector DE, and at Q draw a line
perpendicular to the line to intersect DE at C, the center of the required tangent arc.
Given an arc with center Q, point P, and radius R (Figure 4.25c), from P, draw an arc with
radius R. From Q, draw an arc with radius equal to that of the given arc plus R. The
intersection C of the arcs is the center of the required tangent arc.
Step by Step
Drawing an Arc Tangent to Two Arcs
Creating Construction Geometry
CAD software typically provides a command option to draw a circle or arc tangent to two
entities (any combination of arcs, circles, or lines) given the radius. For example, the
AutoCAD Circle command has an option called Ttr (tangent, tangent, radius). When you usethis command, you first select the two drawing objects to which the new circle will be tangent
and then enter the radius.
Take a look at the shift lever drawing. To draw this figure you must use a geometric
construction to find the center of the 1.00-radius tangent arc. Before the lower 4.20-radius arc
can be drawn, the smaller 1.00-radius arc must be constructed tangent to the 1.50 diameter
circle. When an arc is tangent to a circle, its center must be the radius distance away from that
circle.
 Use basic CAD commands to draw the portions shown.
 Construct circle B with a radius 1.00 larger than circle A. You can use the AutoCAD
Offset command to do this quickly. The desired tangent arc must have its center somewhere
on circle B. The vertical dimension of 1.25 is given between the two centers in the drawing.
Construct line C at this distance. The only point that is on both the circle and the line is the
center of the desired tangent arc. Draw the 1.00-radius circle tangent to the 1.50-diameter circle and centered on the point
just found.
 Next, construct the lower 4.20-radius arc to be tangent to the lower curve at the left and
to the 1.00-radius circle. Then, trim the circles at their intersections to form the desired arcs.Geometric Constraints
Using geometric constraints is another way to create this CAD geometry. When geometric
constraints are used, a general-case arc can be drawn that is not perfectly tangent. Then, a
tangent constraint, the vertical dimension between the arc center and the circle, and the
required radius can be applied to the arc as drawn. The software will then calculate the correct
arc based on these constraints.
If the desired distance changes, the dimensional constraint values can be updated, and the
software will recalculate the new arc. Not all software provides constraint-based modeling,
especially in a 2D drafting context. The AutoCAD software has had this feature since release
2010.
When using constraint-based modeling, you still must understand the drawing geometry
clearly to create a consistent set of geometric and dimensional constraints.
Tip
Two different tangent circles with the same radius are possible—one as shown and one that
includes both circles. To get the desired arc using AutoCAD, select near the tangent location
for the correctly positioned arc.
4.4 Bisecting an AngleFigure 4.26a shows the given angle BAC to be bisected.
4.26 Bisecting an Angle
Lightly draw large arc with center at A to intersect lines AC and AB.
Lightly draw equal arcs r with radius slightly larger than half BC, to intersect at D.
Draw line AD, which bisects the angle.
4.5 Drawing a Line through a Point and Parallel to a Line
With given point P as center, and any convenient radius R, draw arc CD to intersect the given
line AB at E (Figure 4.27). With E as center and the same radius, strike arc R′ to intersect the
given line at G. With PG as radius and E as center, strike arc r to locate point H. The line PH
is the required parallel line.
4.27 Drawing a Line through a PointUsing AutoCAD, you can quickly draw a new line parallel to a given line and through a given
point using the Offset command with the Through option. Another method is to use the
Parallel object snap while drawing the line as shown in Figure 4.28. You can also copy the
original line and place the copy through the point.

4.8 Laying Out an Angle
Many angles can be laid out directly with the triangle or protractor. For more accuracy, use
one of the methods shown in Figure 4.31.4.31 Laying Out Angles
Tangent Method The tangent of angle θ is y/x, and y = xtanθ. Use a convenient value for x,
preferably 10 units (Figure 4.31a). (The larger the unit, the more accurate will be the
construction.) Look up the tangent of angle θ and multiply by 10, and measure y = 10tanθ.
EXAMPLE To set off 31 − 1/2°, find the natural tangent of 31 − 1/2°, which is 0.6128. Then, 
y = 10units × 0.6128 = 6.128units.
Sine Method Draw line x to any convenient length, preferably 10 units (Figure 4.31b). Find
the sine of angle θ, multiply by 10, and draw arc with radius R = 10sinθ. Draw the other side
of the angle tangent to the arc, as shown.
EXAMPLE To set off 25 − 1/2°, find the natural sine of 25 − 1/2°, which is 0.4305. Then 
R = 10units × 0.4305 = 4.305units.
Chord Method Draw line x of any convenient length, and draw an arc with any convenient
radius R—say 10 units (Figure 4.31c). Find the chordal length C using the formula 
C = 2sinθ/2. Machinists’ handbooks have chord tables. These tables are made using a radius
of 1 unit, so it is easy to scale by multiplying the table values by the actual radius used.
EXAMPLE Half of 43°20′ = 21°40′. The sine of 
21°40′ = 0.3692.C = 2 × 0.3692 = 0.7384 for a 1 unit radius. For a 10 unit radius, 
C = 7.384 units.
EXAMPLE To set off 43°20′, the chordal length C for 1 unit radius, as given in a table of
chords, equals 0.7384. If R = 10 units, then C = 7.384 units.4.9 Drawing an Equilateral Triangle
Side AB is given. With A and B as centers and AB as radius, lightly construct arcs to intersect
at C (Figure 4.32a). Draw lines AC and BC to complete the triangle.
4.32 Drawing an Equilateral Triangle
Alternative Method Draw lines through points A and B, making angles of 60° with the given
line and intersecting C (Figure 4.32b).
4.10 Polygons
A polygon is any plane figure bounded by straight lines (Figure 4.33). If the polygon has
equal angles and equal sides, it can be inscribed in or circumscribed around a circle and is
called a regular polygon.
4.33 Regular PolygonsTip
The AutoCAD Polygon command is used to draw regular polygons with any number of
sides. The polygon can be based on the radius of an inscribed or circumscribed circle. The
length of an edge of the polygon can also be used to define the size. Figure 4.34 shows the
quick help for the Polygon command. The Rectangle command is another quick way to
make a square in AutoCAD.
4.34 Polygons can be defined by the number of sides and whether they are inscribed in or circumscribed around a circle.

Dividers Method: Divide the circumference of the circumscribed circle into five equal parts
with the dividers, and join the points with straight lines (Figure 4.35a).4.35 Drawing a Pentagon
Geometric Method:
Bisect radius OD at C (Figure 4.35b).
Use C as the center and CA as the radius to lightly draw arc AE. With A as center and AE as
radius, draw arc EB (Figure 4.35c).
Draw line AB, then measure off distances AB around the circumference of the circle. Draw the
sides of the pentagon through these points (Figure 4.35d).
4.12 Drawing a Hexagon
Each side of a hexagon is equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle (Figure 4.36a). To use
a compass or dividers, use the radius of the circle to mark the six points of the hexagon around
the circle. Connect the points with straight lines. Check your accuracy by making sure the
opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel.4.36 Drawing a Hexagon
Centerline Variation Draw vertical and horizontal centerlines (Figure 4.36b). With A and B
as centers and radius equal to that of the circle, draw arcs to intersect the circle at C, D, E, and
F, and complete the hexagon as shown.
Hexagons, especially when drawn to create bolt heads, are usually dimensioned by the
distance across the flat sides (not across the corners). When creating a hexagon using CAD, it
is typical to draw it as circumscribed about a circle, so that the circle diameter is defining the
distance across the flat sides of the hexagon (see Figure 4.37).
4.37 Across Flats vs. Across Corners
4.13 Ellipses
An ellipse can be defined by its major and minor axis distances. The major axis is the longer
axis of the ellipse; the minor axis is the shorter axis. Some ellipses are shown and labeled in
Figure 4.38.
4.38 Major and Minor Axes of Some EllipsesAn ellipse is created by a point moving along a path where the sum of its distances from two
points, each called a focus of an ellipse (foci is the plural form), is equal to the major diameter.
As an aid in understanding the shape of an ellipse, imagine pinning the ends of a string in the
locations of the foci, then sliding a pencil along inside the string, keeping it tightly stretched,
as in Figure 4.39. You would not use this technique when sketching, but it serves as a good
illustration of the definition of an ellipse.
4.39 Pencil and String Method. When an ellipse is created with the pencil-and-string method, the length of the string
between the foci is equal to the length of the major axis of the ellipse. Any point that can be reached by a pencil inside the
string when it is pulled taut meets the condition that its distances from the two foci sum to the length of the major diameter.
Most CAD systems provide an Ellipse command that lets you enter the major and minor axis
lengths, center, or the angle of rotation for a circle that is to appear elliptical.
Spotlight
Locating the Foci of an Ellipse
To locate the foci of an ellipse, draw arcs with their centers at the ends of the minor axis and
their radii equal to half the major axis. The intersection of each pair of arcs is a focus of the
ellipse.Spotlight
The Perimeter of an Ellipse
The perimeter, P, of an ellipse is a set of points defined by their distance from the two foci.
The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci must be equal to the
length of the major diameter. The perimeter of an ellipse may be approximated in different
ways. Many CAD packages use infinite series to most closely approximate the perimeter. The
mathematical relationship of each point on the ellipse to the major and minor axes may be
seen in the approximation of the perimeter at right:
P = 2π√ x

24.14 Spline Curves
Splines are used to describe complex, or freeform, curves. Many surfaces cannot be easily
defined using simple curves such as circles, arcs, or ellipses. For example, the flowing curves
used in automobile design blend many different curves into a smooth surface. Creating lifelike
shapes and aerodynamic forms may require spline curves (Figure 4.40).
4.40 Complex Curves. The organic shape of this flowerlike bowl was created using SolidWorks splines. Splines can be
controlled in a variety of ways. The enlarged view shows the curvature combs used to view the effect of the controlling curves
that make up the spline. Dragging a control handle changes the direction of the curve at the control vertex. (Courtesy of Robert
Kincaid.)
The word spline originally described a flexible piece of plastic or rubber used to draw
irregular curves between points. Mathematical methods generate the points on the curve for
CAD applications.
One way to create an irregular curve is to draw curves between each set of points. The points
and the tangencies at each point are used in a polynomial equation that determines the shape
of the curve. This type of curve is useful in the design of a ship’s hull or an aircraft wing.
Because this kind of irregular curve passes through all the points used to define the curve, it is
sometimes called an interpolated spline or a cubic spline. An example and its vertices are
shown in Figure 4.41.4.41 Interpolated Spline. An interpolated spline curve passes through all the points used to define the curve.
Other spline curves are approximated: they are defined by a set of vertices. The resulting
curve does not pass through all the vertices. Instead, the vertices “pull” the curve in the
direction of the vertex. Complex curves can be created with relatively few vertices using
approximation methods. Figure 4.42 shows a 3D approximated spline curve and its vertices.
4.42 Approximated Spline. Except for the beginning and endpoints, the fit points for the spline curve stored in the database
do not always lie on the curve. They are used to derive the curve mathematically.
The mathematical definition for this type of spline curve uses the X- and Y- (and Z- for a 3D
shape) coordinates and a parameter, generally referred to as u. A polynomial equation is used
to generate functions in u for each point used to specify the curve. The resulting functions arethen blended to generate a curve that is influenced by each point specified but not necessarily
coincident with any of them.
Spotlight
B-Splines
The Bezier curve was one of the first methods to use spline approximation to create flowing
curves in CAD applications. The first and last vertices are on the curve, but the rest of the
vertices contribute to a blended curve between them. The Bezier method uses a polynomial
curve to approximate the shape of a polygon formed by the specified vertices. The order of the
polynomial is 1 degree less than the number of vertices in the polygon (see Figure 4.43).
4.43 Bezier Curve. A Bezier curve passes through the first and last vertex but uses the other vertices as control points to
generate a blended curve.
The Bezier method is named for Pierre Bezier, a pioneer in computer-generated surface
modeling at Renault, the French automobile manufacturer. Bezier sought an easier way of
controlling complex curves, such as those defined in automobile surfaces. His technique
allowed designers to shape natural-looking curves more easily than they could by specifying
points that had to lie on the resulting curve, yet the technique also provided control over the
shape of the curve. Changing the slope of each line segment defined by a set of vertices
adjusts the slope of the resulting curve (see Figure 4.44). One disadvantage of the Bezier
formula is that the polynomial curve is defined by the combined influence of every vertex: a
change to any vertex redraws the entire curve between the start point and endpoint.4.44 Editing a Bezier Curve. Every vertex contributes to the shape of a Bezier curve. Changing the location of a single
vertex redraws the entire curve.
A B-spline approximation is a special case of the Bezier curve that is more commonly used in
engineering to give the designer more control when editing the curve. A B-spline is a blended
piecewise polynomial curve passing near a set of control points. The spline is referred to as
piecewise because the blending functions used to combine the polynomial curves can vary
over the different segments of the curve. Thus, when a control point changes, only the piece of
the curve defined by the new point and the vertices near it change, not the whole curve (see
Figure 4.45). B-splines may or may not pass through the first and last points in the vertex set.
Another difference is that for the B-spline the order of the polynomial can be set
independently of the number of vertices or control points defining the curve.
4.45 B-Spline Approximation. The B-spline is constructed piecewise, so changing a vertex affects the shape of the curve
near only that vertex and its neighbors.
In addition to being able to locally modify the curve, many modelers allow sets of vertices to
be weighted differently. The weighting, sometimes called tolerance, determines how closely
the curve should fit the set of vertices. Curves can range from fitting all the points to being
loosely controlled by the vertices. This type of curve is called a nonuniform rational B-spline,
or NURBS curve. A rational curve (or surface) is one that has a weight associated with each
control point.Splines are drawn in CAD systems based on the mathematical relationships defining their
geometry. Figure 4.46 shows an approximated spline drawn using AutoCAD. Figure 4.47
shows an interpolated spline drawn using SolidWorks. Both curves are drawn with a spline
command, and both provide a dialog box that allows you to change properties defining the
curve; however, the properties that are controlled vary by the type of spline being created by
the software package. You should be familiar with the terms used by your modeling software
for creating different types of spline curves.

4.15 Geometric Relationships
When you are sketching, you often imply a relationship, such as being parallel or
perpendicular, by the appearance of the lines or through notes or dimensions. When you are
creating a CAD model you use drawing aids to specify these relationships between geometric
entities.
Two lines or planes are parallel when they are an equal distance apart at every point. Parallel
entities never intersect, even if extended to infinity. Figure 4.48 shows an example of parallel
lines.4.48 The highlighted lines are parallel.
Two lines or planes are perpendicular when they intersect at right angles (or when the
intersection that would be formed if they were extended would be a right angle), as in Figure
4.49.
4.49 The highlighted lines are perpendicular.
Two entities intersect if they have at least one point in common. Two straight lines intersect at
only a single point. A circle and a straight line intersect at two points, as shown in Figure 4.50.
4.50 The highlighted circle intersects the highlighted line at two different points.
When two lines intersect, they define an angle as shown in Figure 4.51.
4.51 An angle is defined by the space between two lines (such as those highlighted here) or planes that intersect.The term apparent intersection refers to lines that appear to intersect in a 2D view or on a
computer monitor but actually do not touch, as shown in Figure 4.52. When you look at a
wireframe view of a model, the 2D view may show lines crossing each other when, in fact, the
lines do not intersect in 3D space. Changing the view of the model can help you determine
whether an intersection is actual or apparent.
4.52 Apparent Intersection. From the shaded view of this model in (a), it is clear that the back lines do not intersect the half￾circular shape. In the wireframe front view in (b), the lines appear to intersect.
Two entities are tangent if they touch each other but do not intersect, even if extended to
infinity, as shown in Figure 4.53. A line that is tangent to a circle will have only one point in
common with the circle.
4.53 Tangency. Lines that are tangent to an entity have one point in common but never intersect. 3D objects may be tangent
at a single point or along a line.When a line is tangent to a circle, a radial line from the center of the circle is perpendicular at
the point of tangency, as shown in Figure 4.54. Knowing this can be useful in creating
sketches and models.
4.54 A radial line from the point where a line is tangent to a circle will always be perpendicular to that line.
The regular geometry of points, lines, circles, arcs, and ellipses is the foundation for many
CAD drawings that are created from these types of entities alone. Figure 4.55 shows a 2D
CAD drawing that uses only lines, circles, and arcs to create the shapes shown. Figure 4.56
shows a 3D wireframe model that is also made entirely of lines, circles, and arcs. Many
complex-looking 2D and 3D images are made solely from combinations of these shapes.
Recognizing these shapes and understanding the many ways you can specify them in the CAD
environment are key modeling skills.

4.16 Solid Primitives
Many 3D objects can be visualized, sketched, and modeled in a CAD system by combining
simple 3D shapes or primitives. They are the building blocks for many solid objects. You
should become familiar with these common shapes and their geometry. The same primitives
that are useful when sketching objects are also used to create 3D models of those objects.
A common set of primitive solids used to build more complex objects is shown in Figure 4.57.
Which of these objects are polyhedra? Which are bounded by single-curved surfaces? Which
are bounded by double-curved surfaces? How many vertices do you see on the cone? How
many on the wedge? How many edges do you see on the box? Familiarity with the appearance
of these primitive shapes when shown in orthographic views can help you in interpreting
drawings and in recognizing features that make up objects. Figure 4.58 shows the primitives
in two orthographic views. Review the orthographic views and match each to the isometric of
the same primitive shown in Figure 4.57.4.57 Solid Primitives. The most common solid primitives are (a) box, (b) sphere, (c) cylinder, (d) cone, (e) torus, (f) wedge,
and (g) pyramid.
4.58 Match the top and front views shown here with the primitives shown in Figure 4.57.
Look around and identify some solid primitives that make up the shapes you see. The ability
to identify the primitive shapes can help you model features of the objects using a CAD
system (see Figure 4.59). Also, knowing how primitive shapes appear in orthographic views
can help you sketch these features correctly and read drawings that others have created.4.59 Complex Shapes. The 3D solid primitives in this illustration show basic shapes that make up a telephone handset.

Making Complex Shapes with Boolean Operations
Boolean operations, common to most 3D modelers, allow you to join, subtract, and intersect
solids. Boolean operations are named for the English mathematician George Boole, who
developed them to describe how sets can be combined. Applied to solid modeling, Boolean
operations describe how volumes can be combined to create new solids.
The three Boolean operations, defined in Table 4.1, are

The volume from one set is subtracted or eliminated from
the volume in another set. The eliminated set is completely
eliminated—even the portion that does not overlap the other
volume. The order of the sets selected when using
difference does matter (see Figure 4.60). A subtract B is not
the same as B subtract A.
Intersection The volume common to both sets is retained. Order does not
matter: B intersect A is the same as A intersect B.
4.60 Order Matters in Subtraction. The models here illustrate how A – B differs significantly from B – A.

Figure 4.61 illustrates the result of the Boolean operations on three pairs of solid models.
Look at some everyday objects around you and make a list of the primitive solid shapes and
Boolean operations needed to make them.4.61 Boolean Operations. The three sets of models at left produce the results shown at right when the two solids are (a)
unioned, (b) subtracted, and (c) intersected.
Figure 4.62 shows a bookend and a list of the primitives available in the CAD system used to
create it, along with the Boolean operations used to make the part.4.62 Shapes in a Bookend. This diagram shows how basic shapes were combined to make a bookend. The box and cylinder
at the top were unioned, then the resulting end piece and another box were unioned. To form the cutout in the end piece,
another cylinder and box were unioned, then the resulting shape was subtracted from the end piece.
4.17 Recognizing Symmetry
An object is symmetrical when it has the same exact shape on opposite sides of a dividing line
(or plane) or about a center or axis. Recognizing the symmetry of objects can help you in your
design work and when you are sketching or using CAD to represent an object. Figure 4.63
shows a shape that is symmetrical about several axes of symmetry (of which two are shown)
as well as about the center point of the circle.4.63 Symmetrical Part. Symmetrical parts can have symmetry about a line or point, or both.
Mirrored shapes have symmetry where points on opposite sides of the dividing line (or mirror
line) are the same distance away from the mirror line. For a 2D mirrored shape, the axis of
symmetry is the mirror line. For a 3D mirrored shape, the symmetry is about a plane.
Examples of 3D mirrored shapes are shown in Figure 4.64.
4.64 3D Mirrored Shapes. Each of these symmetrical shapes has two mirror lines, indicated by the thin axis lines. To create
one of these parts, you could model one quarter of it, mirror it across one of the mirror lines, then mirror the resulting half
across the perpendicular mirror line.
To simplify sketching, you need to show only half the object if it is symmetrical (Figure 4.65).
A centerline line pattern provides a visual reference for the mirror line on the part.
4.65 Orthographic sketches of symmetrical parts may show only half of the object.
Most CAD systems have a command available to mirror existing features to create new
features. You can save a lot of modeling time by noticing the symmetry of the object and
copying or mirroring the existing geometry to create new features.
Right- and Left-Hand Parts
Many parts function in pairs for the right and left sides of a device. A brake lever for the left
side of a mountain bike is a mirror image of the brake lever for the right side of the bike
(Figure 4.66). Using CAD, you can create the part for the left side by mirroring the entire part.On sketches you can indicate a note such as RIGHT-HAND PART IS SHOWN. LEFT-HAND
PART IS OPPOSITE. Right-hand and left-hand are often abbreviated as RH and LH in
drawing notes.
4.66 Right- and Left-hand Brake Levers
Tip
Using symmetry when you model can be important when the design requires it. When the
design calls for symmetrical features to be the same, mirroring the feature ensures that the
two resulting features will be the same.
Parting-Line Symmetry
Molded symmetrical parts are often made using a mold with two halves, one on each side of
the axis of symmetry. The axis or line where two mold parts join is called a parting line.
When items are removed from a mold, sometimes a small ridge of material is left on the
object. See if you can notice a parting line on a molded object such as your toothbrush or a
screwdriver handle such as the one shown in Figure 4.67. Does the parting line define a plane
about which the object is symmetrical? Can you determine why that plane was chosen? Does
it make it easier to remove the part from the mold? As you are developing your sketching and
modeling skills think about the axis of symmetry for parts and how it could affect their
manufacture.4.67 Parting Line. The parting line on a molded part is often visible as a ridge of material.4.68 Two Halves of a Mold Used to Form a Strap (shown at left). (Two straps can be molded at once.)
4.18 Extruded Forms
Extrusion is the manufacturing process of forcing material through a shaped opening (Figure
4.69). Extrusion in CAD modeling creates a 3D shape in a way similar to the extrusion
manufacturing process. This modeling method is common even when the part will not be
manufactured as an extrusion.4.69 Extruded Shape. Symmetry and several common geometric shapes were used to create this linear guide system. The rail
in (a) was created by forcing aluminum through an opening with the shape of its cross section. The extruded length was then
cut to the required length. The solid model in (c) was created by defining the 2D cross-sectional shape (b) and specifying a
length for the extrusion. (Integrated configuration of Integral V™ linear guides courtesy of PBCLinear.)
To create as shape by extrusion, sketch the 2D outline of the basic shape of the object (usually
called a profile), and then specify the length for the extrusion. Most 3D CAD systems provide
an Extrude command. Some CAD systems allow a taper (or draft) angle to be specified to
narrow the shape over its length (Figure 4.70).4.70 These CAD models were formed by extruding a 2D outline. Two of the models were extruded with a taper.
Swept Shapes
A swept form is a special case of an extruded form. Sweeping describes extruding a shape
along a curved path. To sweep a shape in CAD, create the 2D profile and a 2D or 3D curve to
serve as the path. Some swept shapes are shown in Figure 4.71.
4.71 Swept Shapes. These shapes started as an octagon, a circle, and an ellipse, then were swept along a curved path.
Spotlight
Sketching Extruded Shapes
Shapes that can be created using extrusion are often easily sketched as oblique projections. To
sketch extruded shapes, show the shape (or profile) that will be extruded parallel to the frontviewing plane in the sketch. Copy this same shape over and up in the sketch based on the
angle and distance you want to use to represent the depth. Then, sketch in the lines for the
receding edges.
4.19 Revolved Forms
Revolution creates 3D forms from basic shapes by revolving a 2D profile around an axis to
create a closed solid object. To create a revolved solid, create the 2D shape to be revolved,
specify an axis about which to revolve it, then indicate the number of degrees of revolution.
Figure 4.72 shows some shapes created by revolution.
4.72 Revolved Shapes. Each of the solids shown here was created by revolving a 2D shape around an axis.Often, a 2D sketch is used to create 3D CAD models. Look at the examples shown in Figure
4.73 and match them to the 2D profile used to create the part. For each part, decide whether
extrusion, revolution, or sweeping was used to create it.
4.73 What operation would you choose to transform the profiles shown in (a) into the models in (b)?
4.20 Irregular Surfaces
Not every object can be modeled using the basic geometric shapes explored in this chapter.
Irregular surfaces are those that cannot be unfolded or unrolled to lie in a flat plane. Solids that
have irregular or warped surfaces cannot be created merely by extrusion or revolution. These
irregular surfaces are created using surface modeling techniques. Spline curves are frequently
the building blocks of the irregular surfaces found on car and snowmobile bodies, molded
exterior parts, aircraft, and other (usually exterior) surfaces of common objects, such as an
ergonomic mouse. An example of an irregular surface is shown in Figure 4.74. You will learn
more about modeling irregular surfaces in Chapter 5.4.74 Irregular Surfaces
4.21 User Coordinate Systems
Most CAD systems allow you to create your own coordinate systems to aid in creating
drawing geometry. These are often termed user coordinate systems (in Auto- CAD, for
example) or local coordinate systems, in contrast with the default coordinate system
(sometimes called the world coordinate system or absolute coordinate system) that is used to
store the model in the drawing database. To use many CAD commands effectively, you must
know how to orient a user coordinate system.
Most CAD systems create primitive shapes the same way each time with respect to the current
X-, Y-, and Z-directions. For example the circular shape of the cylinder is always in the
current X-Y plane, as shown in Figure 4.75.4.75 Cylinder Construction. The cylinder is created with the circular base on the X-Y plane and the height in Z.
To create a cylinder oriented differently, create a user coordinate system in the desired
orientation (Figure 4.76).4.76 These cylinders were created after the X-Y plane of the coordinate system was reoriented.
To create the hole perpendicular to the oblique surface shown in Figure 4.77, create a new
local coordinate system aligned with the inclined surface. After you have specified the
location of the hole using the more convenient local coordinate system, the CAD software
translates the location of the hole to the world (default) coordinate system.
images
4.77 Drawing on an Inclined Plane. A new coordinate system is defined relative to the slanted surface to make it easy to
create the hole.
TipAll CAD systems have a symbol that indicates the location of the coordinate axes—both the
global one used to store the model and any user-defined one that is active. Explore your
modeler so you are familiar with the way it indicates each.
Many CAD systems have a command to define the plane for a user coordinate system by
specifying three points. This is often an easy way to orient a new coordinate system—
especially when it needs to align with an oblique or inclined surface. Other solid modeling
systems allow the user to select an existing part surface on which to draw the new shape. This
is analogous to setting the X-Y plane of the user coordinate system to coincide with the
selected surface. With constraint-based modelers a “sketch plane” often is selected on which a
basic shape is drawn that will be used to form a part feature. This defines a coordinate system
for the sketch plane.
A user or local coordinate system is useful for creating geometry in a model. Changing the
local coordinate system does not change the default coordinate system where the model data
are stored.
4.22 Transformations
A 3D CAD package uses the default Cartesian coordinate system to store information about
the model. One way it may be stored is as a matrix (rows and columns of numbers)
representing the vertices of the object. Once the object is defined, the software uses
mathematical methods to transform the matrix (and the object) in various ways. There are two
basic kinds of transformations: those that transform the model itself (called geometric
transformations) and those that merely change the view of the model (called viewing
transformations).
Geometric Transformations
The model stored in the computer is changed using three basic transformations (or changes):
moving (sometimes called translation), rotating, and scaling. When you select a CAD
command that uses one of these transformations, the CAD data stored in your model areconverted mathematically to produce the result. Commands such as Move (or Translate),
Rotate, and Scale transform the object on the coordinate system and change the coordinates
stored in the 3D model database.
Figure 4.78 shows a part after translation. The model was moved over 2 units in the X￾direction and 3 units in the Y-direction. The corner of the object is no longer located at the
origin of the coordinate system.
images
4.78 Translation. This model has been moved 2 units in the X-direction and 3 units in the Y-direction.
Figure 4.79 illustrates the effect of rotation. The rotated object is situated at a different
location in the coordinate system. Figure 4.80 shows the effect of scaling. The scaled object is
larger dimensionally than the previous object.

4.79 Rotation. This model has been rotated in the X-Y plane.

4.80 Scaling. This model has been scaled to 1.5 times its previous size.
Tip
The following command names are typically used when transforming geometry:
Move
Rotate
Scale
Viewing TransformationsA viewing transformation does not change the coordinate system or the location of the model
on the coordinate system; it simply changes your view of the model. The model’s vertices are
stored in the computer at the same coordinate locations no matter the direction from which the
model is viewed on the monitor (Figure 4.81).
images
4.81 Changing the View. Note that the location of the model relative to the coordinate axes does not change in any of the
different views. Changing the view does not transform the model itself.
Although the model’s coordinates do not change when the view does, the software does
mathematically transform the model database to produce the new appearance of the model on
the screen. This viewing transformation is stored as a separate part of the model file (or a
separate file) and does not affect the coordinates of the stored model. Viewing transformations
change the view on the screen but do not change the model relative to the coordinate system.
Tip
The following are typical command names for view transformations:
Pan
Spin (or Rotate View)
Zoom
Common viewing transformations are illustrated in Figure 4.82. Panning moves the location
of the view on the screen. If the monitor were a hole through which you were viewing a piece
of paper, panning would be analogous to sliding the piece of paper to expose a different
portion of it through the hole. Zooming enlarges or reduces the view of the objects and
operates similar to a telephoto lens on a camera. A view rotation is actually a change of
viewpoint; the object appears to be rotated, but it is your point of view that is changing. The
object itself remains in the same location on the coordinate system.images images images
4.82 Common View Transformations. Panning moved the view of the objects in (a) to expose a different portion of the part
in (b). In (c), the view is enlarged to show more detail. In (d), the view is rotated to a different line of sight. In each case, the
viewing transformation applies to all the objects in the view and does not affect the location of the objects on the coordinate
system. (Notice that the position relative to the coordinate system icon does not change.)
Viewing controls transform only the viewing transformation file, changing just your view.
Commands to scale the object on the coordinate system transform the object’s coordinates in
the database.
Examine the six models and their coordinates in Figure 4.83. Which are views that look
different because of changes in viewing controls? Which look different because the objects
were rotated, moved, or scaled on the coordinate system?
images
4.83 Geometric or Viewing Transformation? Three of these models are the same, but the viewing location, zoom, or rotation
has changed. Three have been transformed to different locations on the coordinate system.
You will use the basic geometric shapes and concepts outlined in this chapter to build CAD
models and create accurate freehand sketches. The ability to visualize geometric entities on
the Cartesian coordinate system will help you manipulate the coordinate system when
modeling in CAD.Industry Case
The Geometry of 3D Modeling: Use the Symmetry
Strategix ID used magnets to create a clean, quiet, zero maintenance brake for the exercise
bike it designed for Park City Entertainment. When copper rings on the bike’s iron flywheel
spin past four rare-earth magnets, they create current in circular flow (an eddy current) that
sets up a magnetic field.
This opposing magnetic field dissipates power and slows the wheel. Moving the magnets onto
and off the copper rings varies the amount of resistance delivered. When Marty Albini, Senior
Mechanical Engineer, modeled the plastic magnet carrier for the brake, he started with the
magnets and their behavior as the carrier moved them onto and off the copper rings (see
Figure 4.84). “There is no one way to think about modeling a part,” Albini said. “The key is to
design for the use of the part and the process that will be used to manufacture it.” To make the
magnet carrier symmetrical, Albini started by modeling half of it.
images
4.84 Flywheel Assembly. The magnet carrier for the brake was designed to move onto and off the conductor ring by sliding
along an elliptical guide tube, pulled by a cable attached to the small tab in the middle of the carrier.
The magnet carrier was designed as a part in the larger flywheel assembly, parts of which were
already completed.
Each pair of magnets was attached to a backing bar that kept them a fixed distance apart. To
begin, Albini started with the geometry he was sure of: the diameter of the magnets, the space
between them, and the geometry of the conductor ring. He sketched an arc sized to form a
pocket around one of the magnets so that its center point would be located on the centerline of
the conductor ring (see Figure 4.85). He then sketched another similar arc but with its center
point positioned to match the distance between the centers of the two magnets. He connected
the two arcs with parallel lines to complete the sketch of the inside of the carrier. This outline
was offset to the outside by the thickness of the wall of the holder. (Because this is aninjection-molded plastic part, a uniform wall thickness was used throughout.) One final
constraint was added to position the carrier against the rail on the elliptical tube along which it
would slide: the outside of the inner arc is tangent to this rail. With the sketch geometry fully
defined, Albini extruded the sketch up to the top of the guide tube and down to the running
clearance from the copper ring.
images
4.85 Extruding the Carrier. The magnet carrier was extruded up and down from the sketch, shown here as an outline in the
middle of the extruded part. Notice that the sketch is tangent to the guide tube rail, and the centers of the arcs in the sketch
are located on the centerline of the conductor ring.
To add a lid to the holder, Albini used the SolidWorks Offset command to trace the outline of
the holder. First, he clicked on the top of the holder to make its surface the active sketch plane.
This is equivalent to changing the user coordinate system in other packages: it signals to
SolidWorks that points picked from the screen lie on this plane. He then selected the top edges
of the holder and used the Offset command with a 0 offset to “trace” the outline as a new
sketch. To form the lid, he extruded the sketch up (in the positive Z-direction) the distance of
the uniform wall thickness.
SolidWorks joined this lid to the magnet holder automatically because both features are in the
same part and have surfaces that are coincident. This built-in operation is similar to a Boolean
join in that the two shapes are combined to be one.
For the next feature, Albini created a “shelf” at the height of the rail on which the holder will
slide. Using Offset again, he traced the outline of the holder on the sketch plane, then added
parallel and perpendicular lines to sketch the outline of the bottom of the shelf. The outline
was then extruded up by the wall thickness. The distance from the outside of the magnet
holder to the edge of the shelf created a surface that would sit on the rail (see Figure 4.86).
images
4.86 Changing the Sketch Plane. The surface of the rail was used as the sketch plane for the “shelf” on which the magnet
carrier will slide.Two walls were added by offsetting the edge of the shelf toward the magnet holder by the wall
thickness, then offsetting the edge again by 0. Lines were added to connect the endpoints into
an enclosed shape to be extruded. (In SolidWorks, an extrusion can be specified to extend in
one or both directions, and to extend to a vertex, a known distance, the next surface, or the last
surface encountered.) For the walls, Albini extruded them to the top surface of the magnet
holder “lid.”
The connecting web between the magnet holders needed to match the shape of the elliptical
tube in the flywheel assembly (see Figure 4.87). To make it, Albini sketched an ellipse on the
newly created wall. An ellipse is a sketching primitive that can be specified by entering the
length of the major and minor axes. Albini used the dimensions from the tube for the first
ellipse sketch, then drew a second one with the same center point but with longer axes so that
a gap equal to the wall thickness between them would be formed. The two ellipses were
trimmed off at the bottom surface of the shelf and at the midpoint, and lines were drawn to
make a closed outline. The finished sketch was extruded to the outside surface of the opposite
wall.
images
4.87 This view of the magnet carrier shows the elliptical shape of the connecting web and the rectangular shape of the tab.
The parting line for the part, shown here as a dotted white line, is located at the edge of the fillet on the top of the magnet
chambers.
More walls were sketched and extruded from the bottom surface of the shelf. Then, the wall
over the connecting web was sketched and extruded down to the web.
The next step was to add the rounded edges for the top of the magnet holder. Albini invoked
the Fillet command and selected to round all the edges of the top surface at once. As it created
the fillet, SolidWorks maintained the relationship between the wall surfaces that intersected
the top edge of the holder and extended them to the new location of the edge.
Next, Albini created a tab at the end of the part that would rest on the plastic collar in the
assembly that went all the way around the magnet carrier. He first extruded a rectangularshape up from the top of the collar to form the “floor” of the tab. The walls of the tab required
two additional extrusions.
The fillet at the top of the magnet holder provided the location for the parting line—the line
where the two halves of the mold would come apart and release the part. Albini added a
parting plane and used the built-in Draft option to add taper to the part so it would come out
of the mold. After selecting all the surfaces below the parting plane, he specified a draft angle,
and SolidWorks adjusted all the surfaces. This feature of SolidWorks makes it easy to add the
draft angle after a part is finished. When draft is added, the geometry of the part becomes
more complex and harder to work with. A cylinder with draft added becomes a truncated
cone, for example, and the angles at which its edges intersect other edges vary along its
length.
The next step was to add the bosses at the top of the magnet chambers that would support the
bolts controlling the depth of the magnets. As it was a design goal to make the top of the
chamber as stiff as possible to limit flex caused by the attraction of the magnets to the
flywheel, the bosses were placed as far apart as possible, and ribs were added for rigidity. The
bosses were sketched as circles on the top surface of the magnet holder with their centers
concentric with the holes in the bar connecting the magnets below. Both bosses were extruded
up in the same operation.
Ribs in SolidWorks are built-in features. To create a rib, you simply draw a line and specify a
width, and SolidWorks creates the rib and ends it at the first surface it encounters. To create
the center rib, Albini sketched a line on the plane at the top of the bosses and specified a width
(ribs on a plastic part are usually two thirds of the thickness of the walls). The rib was formed
down to the top surface of the holder lid. For the ribs around the bosses, Albini did as Obi
Wan Kenobi might have advised: “Use the symmetry, Luke.” He sketched the lines for ribs
radially from the center points of the bosses (see Figure 4.88). To create the ribs, Albini
created four of them on one boss, then mirrored them once to complete the set for one boss,then mirrored all the ribs from one boss to the other boss. Once all the ribs were formed, he
cut the tops off the ribs and bosses to achieve the shape shown in Figure 4.89.
images
4.88 Bosses and Ribs. Sketched circles were extruded to form the bosses on the top of the magnet chamber. The dotted lines
shown here on the top of the chamber pass through the center point of the bosses and were used to locate the center rib and
radial ribs.
images
4.89 This view of the magnet carrier shows the symmetry of the ribs and the shape that resulted from “slicing off” the top of
the bosses after the ribs were formed. (Images courtesy of Marty Albini. This case study is provided as a courtesy by the owner of the intellectual
property rights, Park City Entertainment. All rights reserved.)
The result was a stiffer rib and a shape that could not be achieved with a single rib operation.
To complete the part, circles were drawn concentric to the bosses and extruded to form holes
that go through the part (see Figure 4.90). Draft was added to the ribs and walls to make the
part release from the mold easily. Fillets were added to round all the edges, reducing stresses
and eliminating hot spots in the mold. Then, the part was mirrored to create the other half. The
center rib and tab for attaching the cable were added and more edges filleted. Draft was added
to the inside of the holder, and the part was complete.
images
4.90 Circles concentric with the bosses were extruded to form the holes before the part was mirrored and remaining features
added to finish the magnet carrier.
Cad at Work
Defining Drawing Geometry
2D CAD programs may allow drawing geometry to be controlled through constraints or
parametric definitions. AutoCAD is one software platform that now provides this tool. In
AutoCAD, constraints are associations that can be applied to 2D geometry to restrict how the
drawing behaves when a change is made.Constraints are of two types:
Geometric constraints create geometric relationships between drawing objects, such as
requiring that a circle remain tangent to a line, even when its radius is updated.
Dimensional constraints define distances, angles, and radii for drawing objects. These
dimensional constraints typically can also be defined by equations, making them a
powerful tool.
Usually, it is best to define the geometric constraints first and then apply dimensional
constraints. This way the essential geometry of the shape is defined, and the dimensions can
be changed as the size requirements vary.
Figure A shows an AutoCAD drawing that uses fixed and tangent constraints. The fixed
constraint allows you to force a drawing object to stay in a permanent location on the
coordinate system. The tangent constraint defines a relationship between two drawing objects,
such as circles, arcs, and lines.
Understanding geometric relationships is a key skill for creating drawings that use parametric
constraints. When geometric constraints are applied awkwardly or when the software does not
provide a robust tool for constraining the shape, it can be difficult to get good results when
updating drawings.

Chapter Summary
Understanding how to produce accurate geometry is required for technical drawings
whether constructed by hand or using a CAD system.All drawings are made up of points, lines, arcs, circles, and other basic elements in relation
to each other. Whether you are drawing manually or using CAD, the techniques are based
on the relationships between basic geometric elements.
CAD systems often produce the same result as a complicated hand construction technique
in a single step. A good understanding of drawing geometry helps you produce quick and
accurate CAD drawings as well as manual drawings.
Skills Summary
You should be able to convert and interpret different coordinate formats used to describe point
locations and be familiar with some of the basic geometry useful in creating CAD drawings.
You should also be able to identify and sketch primitive shapes joined by Boolean operations.
In addition, you should be able to visualize and sketch revolved and extruded shapes.

ANSI/ASME Y14.100 Engineering Drawing Practices
ASME Y14.41 Digital Product Definition Data PracticesThe ENV hydrogen fuel cell motorbike was designed from the fuel cell outward. During its
development many refinements were made both technologically and visually. Models in this phase
must represent the design accurately enough to be used for testing as well as to convey the details of
the design for implementation. (Courtesy of Seymourpowell.)
Overview
Graphic tools are selected for their ability to capture a design idea and to
help team members visualize solutions to the design problem. Freehand
sketches and conceptual representations are the best way to generate and
explore a wide range of options. You cannot model what you have not
planned and thought about.
For design refinement, you need to include the detail necessary to define it
for manufacture, as well as to test it against the design specifications. At thesame time, you need to preserve your ability to modify the design as it
evolves.
Refinement and Modeling
From the solutions generated during ideation, only a few are selected for
further consideration. The design review process determines whether
money will be committed for further development of a design.
The process of refining and analyzing the design is iterative. As the refined
design is tested, the test results suggest modifications to the design, and
once the design is changed, it needs further analysis.
Creating a CAD model is an important step in the refinement process. A
huge amount of design information can be stored in CAD models that are
easily modified. The CAD model can be used to test and evaluate the
design. By making changes easy—and in some cases, automating the
update process—CAD modeling can eliminate some barriers to a thorough
review and refinement of the design.
CAD models also encourage refinement by making it easier and less costly
to get feedback about a design while it is in development. Accurate part
descriptions allow you to test how well parts will fit together. Customer
acceptance and styling issues can be assessed early in the design process
using realistically shaded models. Analysis programs can import 3D CAD
files or run as part of the CAD software, saving much time. Some analysispackages suggest optimizations to incorporate directly in the CAD model.
Animation and kinematic analysis uses CAD data to determine whether the
design will function properly before any parts are actually built.
Many different methods are used to create CAD models, each with its
strengths and weaknesses for capturing design information. Each item
shown in Figure 5.1 may be modeled differently, possibly requiring
different software and techniques.5.1 The same modeling software may be used to model (a) the ergonomic mouse, (b) the piping
system, and (c) the V-block, but different modeling methods may be best suited to each.In this chapter, you will learn how different modeling methods represent
and store design information, and the advantages and disadvantages of
each. This information will aid you in choosing the most effective method
for a particular design problem.

What Is a Model?
In general, a model is a representation of a system, device, or theory that
allows you to predict its behavior. A dictionary definition for model is as
follows:
1. A small object, usually built to scale, that represents in detail another,
often larger object.
2. (a) A preliminary work or construction that serves as a plan from which
a final product is to be made: a clay model ready for casting. (b) Such a
work or construction used in testing or perfecting a final product: a test
model of a solar-powered vehicle.
3. A schematic description of a system, theory, or phenomenon that
accounts for its known or inferred properties and may be used for further
study of its characteristics: a model of generative grammar; a model of
an atom; an economic model.This definition defines three key qualities that are shared to varying degrees
by models used in engineering design:
They represent in detail another object: the product or system to be
produced.
They are a plan from which a final product will be made.
They are used for studying and testing the design to provide an
approximation of how it will behave.
Kinds of Models
Under the broad umbrella term model are several types.
Descriptive Models
Descriptive models represent a system or device in either words or pictures.
Descriptive models sometimes use representations that are simplified or
analogous to something that is more easily understood. The key function of
a descriptive model is to describe; that is, to provide enough detail to
convey an image of the final product.
A set of written specifications for a design is a descriptive model. If all the
specifications are followed, the system will perform correctly. Sketching is
also a type of descriptive model for your design ideas on paper. 2D and 3D
CAD drawings are also descriptive models. A physical model or prototypeis another type of descriptive model, although sometimes physical models
are made to a smaller scale (called a scale model).
The figures at right show a scale model of a design for the Next Generation
Space Telescope (NGST) developed by NASA. A model helps you
visualize the design. It has the added benefit of being easy for non￾engineers to understand while decisions are being made about the next step
in the project.
Spotlight
A 1:10 Scale ModelThis scale model represents a design by Ball Aerospace for the Next
Generation Space Telescope (NGST). The mock-up was the largest and
most complex scale model created by Ball Aerospace. At 1:10 scale, it
represents a telescope that stands over 9 feet tall with a primary mirror 8
meters in diameter when fully deployed (Figure b). Because the primary
mirror is so large, it must be able to fold in on itself to fit inside a launch
vehicle, as shown in Figure a. This scale model demonstrated the
deployment using seventeen computer-controlled motors. Because of theimprobability of servicing this telescope in space, this design is also
partially functional even if the mirrors fail to fully deploy.

Analytical ModelsAn analytical model captures the behavior of the system or device in a
mathematical expression or schematic that can be used to predict future
behavior. The electrical circuit model shown in Figure 5.2 is an example of
an analytical model. The circuit and its properties are represented in the
model by equations and relations that simulate the way the component
would behave in a real circuit. The designer can change values to make
predictions about what will happen in a real circuit that is wired the same
way as the model. This makes it easier, less expensive, and faster to test the
design.
5.2 A simple circuit design model allows simulation of its function. (Courtesy of Cadence Design Systems,
Inc.)
Part of creating an effective analytical model is determining which aspects
of the system’s behavior to model. In the circuit model, some information,
such as interference between some components, is left out because it is too
®complex to represent effectively. A finite element analysis (FEA) model,
such as that used to generate the stress plot shown in Figure 5.3a, simplifies
the CAD model in a similar way. The FEA model breaks the model into
smaller elements; reducing a complicated system to a series of smaller
systems allows the stresses more easily to be solved. Understanding and
using analytical models effectively requires knowing how the model differs
from the actual system so the results can be interpreted correctly.5.3 Finite element analysis (a) is used to calculate the stresses on the gooseneck shown in (b) in
designing this heavy-duty equipment. (Courtesy of TowHaul Corporation.)
In the design process, use different types of models where they are
appropriate. During the ideation phase of the design, sketching is often the
best technique to use. As you begin to refine the design, you will use both
descriptive and analytical models to represent the design more accurately
and to provide insight into its behavior.A 3D CAD model combines qualities of descriptive and analytical models.
Because a 3D CAD model accurately depicts the geometry of a device, it
can fully describe its shape, size, and appearance as a physical or scale
model would. Additional information about the final product, such as the
materials from which it will be made, can also be added to the model
description stored in the computer database. Figure 5.4 shows a CAD model
of NASA’s Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF).5.4 Descriptive and Analytical.This rendered view of the preliminary CAD model of the SIRTF
assembly, shown in (a), looks very similar to the photograph of its 1:10 scale model, shown in (b)
next to a 1:10 model of the Hubble Space Telescope. (Courtesy of Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation.)
A 3D CAD model can also be used for analytical modeling. The 3D model
of the device can be used to study its characteristics (see Figure 5.5).
Sophisticated software allows you to analyze, animate, and predict the
behavior of the design under various physical conditions. The 3D CAD
model is a detailed representation of the final object, suited for testing and
study.5.5 Motion Analysis. These welding robots are programmed with code developed with 3D model
data. The motion of the robots is simulated with a 3D model of the part to be welded and 3D models
of the robots. Motion paths are then exported and used to program the actual robots. (Courtesy of FANUC
America Corporation.)

Model Qualities
Each modeling method has strengths and weaknesses. Models have general
qualities that make them more or less useful for certain purposes and phases
in the design process. Because design is an iterative process, being able to
change the model easily can be important. Also, there can be a significant
investment in equipment and effort in creating CAD models, so it isimportant for them to be useful for a variety of purposes. What are the
qualities that can make models more or less useful?
Good models are
visual (presenting information graphically);
understandable (contain detail in a format suited to the audience);
flexible (allow quick and easy updates and changes);
cost-effective (provide benefits worth the cost of creating the model);
measurable (able to extract size, shape, and other information);
accurate (provide information with useful precision); and
robust (contain information depicting the necessary aspects of the system
and reflecting the design intent).
5.1 2D Models
Paper Drawings
2D sketches and multiview drawings are representations of the design. All
the information defining the object may be shown in a paper drawing (see
Figure 5.6), although it may require many orthographic views.5.6 This fully dimensioned paper drawing contains all the information needed to manufacture this
part, which will be flame cut from a 96 × 156 − inch sheet of steel. (Courtesy of Smith Equipment, USA.)
Multiview drawing techniques were designed to improve the robustness,
measurability, and accuracy of paper drawings. These same techniquesrequire some skill to be understood, however, and make multiview
drawings harder to understand than a 3D model.
Equipment costs for paper drawings are minimal, but they take as long or
longer to create than CAD drawings. Changes involve considerable erasing
and redrawing, making them difficult to modify as the design changes.
Because paper drawings are difficult to change, the labor costs associated
with them usually outweigh the equipment savings.
Paper drawing accuracy is about plus or minus one fortieth the drawing
scale. For example, a paper drawing of a map drawn at a scale of 
1inch = 400 has good accuracy if you can measure from it to plus or
minus 10 feet. This makes paper drawings not particularly measurable or
accurate—which is why proper dimensioning technique was developed.
Proper dimensioning overcomes this limitation and provides measurements
to the desired accuracy on the drawing. It is not good practice to make
measurements from paper drawings.
Paper drawings can be very effective for quickly communicating the design
of small parts for manufacturing. A properly dimensioned sketch can
quickly convey all the information needed to make a part that is needed
only one time (see Figure 5.7). Also, manufacturing facilities occasionally
are not able to read electronic files and require paper drawings.5.7 Computation Sketch Detail (Courtesy of Jeffrey J. Zerr.)
2D CAD Models
2D CAD models share the visual characteristics of paper drawings but are
more accurate and easier to change. CAD systems have a large variety of
editing tools that allow quick editing and reuse of drawing geometry.
Standard symbols are easy to add and change.
2D CAD drawings can quickly be printed to different scales. Different types
of information can be separated onto different layers that can either be
displayed or turned off, making the model more flexible than a paper
drawing.Using CAD, you can accurately define the locations of lines, arcs, and other
geometry. In AutoCAD, for example, you can store these locations to at
least fourteen decimal places. You can query the database, and the
information will be returned as accurately as you originally created it. Of
course, the adage Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO) applies. If your
endpoints do not connect, or you locate distances by eye instead of entering
them precisely, you will not have accurate results.
CAD models represent the object full size, unlike paper drawings, so you
can make measurements and calculations from 2D CAD models. Also, you
can “snap” to locations on objects to determine sizes and distances that may
not be dimensioned on a paper drawing. If there must be a clearance of 10
feet from the center of a tank to the location of another piece of equipment,
you can measure from the CAD file to determine whether proper clearance
is provided in the design.
Text and other information can be saved in a database and linked to the
drawing information for later retrieval. The 2D database is limited,
however, in its ability to represent information that depends on a 3D
definition (such as the volume inside the object), so it is not generally
useful for determining mass and other physical properties of the object.
The strengths and weaknesses of paper drawing are shared by 2D CAD
models. To create them and read them you must be able to interpret the 2D
views to “see” the 3D object. To measure from a 2D CAD model, you mustshow distances and angles true length in a view. Orthographic projection
and descriptive geometry are needed to create these views. Descriptive
geometry is the study of producing views of an object that show true
lengths, shape, angles, and other information about an engineering design.
Mastering these subjects enables you to use auxiliary views created with a
2D CAD system along with the traditional methods of descriptive geometry
to solve many engineering problems.
Flexibility and accuracy make 2D CAD systems a cost-effective tool in a
wide variety of businesses. For many civil engineering projects, the
difficulty of capturing all the 3D information needed to model irregular
surfaces, such as terrain, may not be worth the benefits of working in 3D.
For projects such as highway design, civil mapping, electrical distribution,
and building systems, 2D CAD models may provide enough information
and be created more quickly from the information at hand (see Figure 5.8).
Areas and perimeters can be calculated accurately, and drawings can be
revised quickly. 2D CAD models are more accurate than paper drawings.5.8 Large-scale projects such as this highway plan are often modeled in 2D CAD. Most 2D CAD
systems associate dimension values with the entities they describe, so dimensions can be updated if
the drawing changes. (Courtesy of Montana Department of Transportation, MSU Design Section, Bozeman, MT.)
Tip
If lines and shapes in a 2D CAD drawing are not drawn using methods that
connect exact geometry, they may not actually connect. This can cause a
number of different problems. For example, when crosshatching inside a
boundary, even a small gap can cause the hatching to “leak” out.
The drawing of the geneva cam below appears fine here and on screen. But
when the corner is enlarged, it is clear that the line that should be tangent
to the arc does not connect. Because of the algorithm used to generate
circles and arcs, line segments used to represent them may not appear toconnect when zoomed. But when the CAD drawing is regenerated from the
data in the file, the line will—if tangent—clearly touch the arc, as shown in
(c).
2D Constraint-Based Modeling
Constraint-based modeling originally started as a method for creating 3D
models. Constraint-based 2D models provide a mechanism for defining a
2D shape based on its geometry. Relationships like concentricity and
tangency can be added between entities in the drawing. For example, once a
concentric constraint is added between two circles, they will remain
concentric, and you will be alerted if you attempt to make a change that will
violate this geometric constraint. Dimensions in the drawing constrain the
sizes of features.Relationships defined between parts of the 2D model are maintained by the
software when you make changes to the drawing. Geometric constraints can
be a valuable tool, but to benefit from them, you must apply them with a
good understanding of basic drawing geometry and the behavior desired
when changes are made to the shape.
2D Constraints
2D Constraints in AutoCAD
2D drawing geometry defined using constraints must behave so as to satisfy
the conditions placed on the drawing elements. Small constraint symbols
indicate on-screen which conditions have been defined for the shape. The
following constraints are available for defining AutoCAD geometry:
Horizontal: Lines or pairs of points on objects must remain parallel to
the X-axis.
Vertical: Lines or pairs of points on objects must remain parallel to the
Y-axis.
Perpendicular: Two selected lines must maintain a 90° angle to one
another.
Parallel: Two selected lines must remain parallel.
Tangent: Two curves must maintain tangency to each other or to their
extensions.Smooth: A spline must be contiguous and maintain G2 curvature
continuity with another entity.
Coincident: Two points must stay connected.
Concentric: Two arcs, circles, or ellipses must maintain the same center
point.
Collinear: Two or more line segments must remain along the same line.
Symmetric: Two selected objects must remain symmetrical about a
specified line.
Equal: Selected entities must maintain the same size.
Fix: Points, line endpoints, or curve points must stay in fixed position on
the coordinate system.
The following size constraints are also available:
Linear: The distance between two points along the X- or Y-axis must be
maintained.
Aligned: A distance between two points must be maintained.
Radius: The radius for a curve must be maintained.
Diameter: The diameter of a circle must be maintained.
Angular: The angle between two lines must be maintained.(Autodesk screen shots reprinted courtesy of Autodesk, Inc.)
5.2 3D Models2D models must be interpreted to visualize a 3D object. To convey the
design to individuals unfamiliar with orthographic projection—or to
evaluate properties of the design that are undefined in 2D representations—
3D models are used.
Physical Models
Physical models provide an easy visual reference. Physical models are
called prototypes when they are made full size or used to validate a nearly
final design for production. People can interact with them and get a feel for
how the design will look and how it will function. Many problems with
designs are discovered and corrected when a physical prototype is made.
The robustness and cost effectiveness of physical models are often linked.
A simple model made of clay or cardboard may be enough for some
purposes (see Figure 5.9), but determining the fit of many parts in a large￾scale assembly, or producing a model realistic enough for market testing,
may be cost prohibitive until very late in the design process. A full-size
prototype of the BMW 850I cost more than $1 million to produce. The
amount of information and detail built into the model adds to its cost.5.9 This physical clay model of the Romulus Predator was used to evaluate the aerodynamics of its
lines in a wind tunnel at the University of Michigan. (Courtesy of Mark Gerisch.)
The accuracy of a physical prototype also drives up its cost. Many objects
are designed to be mass produced so that the cost of individual parts is
reduced. When each part in the model must be produced one at a time, the
cost of the prototype can be many times greater than the manufacturing cost
of the final product. The more the model must match the final product in
terms of materials used and final appearance, the greater the cost. Rapid
prototyping systems offer quick and relatively inexpensive means of
generating a physical model of smaller parts without the cost of machining
or forming parts one at a time (see Figure 5.10).5.10 Prototype parts created using a fused deposition modeling system are useful for design
verification. (Courtesy of Stratsys, Inc.)Physical models are a very good visual representation of the design, but if
they are not made from the materials that will be selected for the design,
their weight and other characteristics will not match the final product.
Sometimes, owing to the size of the project, the physical model must be
made to a smaller scale than the final design. The accuracy of the final part
also may not be possible with the materials and processes used for the
prototype.
Probably the least attractive feature of a physical prototype is its lack of
flexibility. Once a physical prototype has been created, changing it is
expensive, difficult, and time-consuming. Consequently, full-size physical
models are not usually used until fairly late in the design process—when
major design changes are less likely. This can limit the usefulness of the
model even though it provides important feedback about items that are not
working well. When the information comes late in the design process, it can
be too expensive to return to a much earlier stage of the design to pursue a
different approach. Only critical problems may be fixed. Solutions to
problems found late in the process are generally constrained to cause the
least amount of redesign while fixing the problem. When a prototype is
created late in the process, there may not be time or resources to create a
new prototype for the new solution. New problems introduced by the
change may not be seen until actual parts are produced.
Despite the trade-offs, even very costly physical models have been a cost￾effective way for companies to avoid much more costly errors inmanufacturing.
3D CAD Models
A 3D CAD model offers all the benefits of a 2D model and a physical
model. As a visual representation, 3D CAD models can generate standard
2D multiview drawings as well as realistically shaded and rendered views.
Because a 3D CAD model accurately depicts the geometry of the device, it
may eliminate the need for a prototype—or make it easy to create one from
the data stored in the model. Options for viewing the model make it
understandable to a wide range of individuals who might be involved with
the design’s refinement (see Figure 5.11).5.11 The 3D model, shown as outline in (a), can also be rendered to produce the realistic view
shown in (b) and to generate accurate 2D views for multiview drawings (c). (Courtesy of Dynojet Research,
Inc.)
Virtual Reality
Virtual reality (VR) refers to interacting with a 3D CAD model as if it were
real—the model simulates the way the user would interact with a real
device or system. Using a virtual reality display, users are immersed in themodel so that they can move around (and sometimes through) it and see it
from different points of view. The headset display shown in Figure 5.12
uses two displays set about 3 inches apart (the typical distance between a
person’s eyes). Each display shows a view of the object as it would be seen
from the eye looking at it, which creates a stereoscopic view similar to the
one sent to the brain by our two eyes. Some headsets let you control the
viewpoint by moving your eyes or head, so that as you look around, a new
view is created to correspond with the new direction.

offering an effective screen size of 80 inches at 2 meters. (Courtesy of Cinoptics.)Some 3D interfaces, such as a 3D mouse or haptic (meaning sense of touch)
controller, let the user interact with the items in the 3D model in a way that
enhances the illusion of reality. Some haptic devices (similar to the gloves
shown in Figure 5.13) even use model data to provide physical feedback to
the user when an object is encountered. If a virtual object is squeezed,
feedback to the device provides the feeling of the resistance a solid object
would give when squeezed. Systems may even interpret how much force
would crush the object and provide this sensation to the user.
5.13 Virtual Reality Gloves. These 5DT Ultra series of data gloves are controlled via a belt-worn
wireless kit designed to transmit data for two gloves simultaneously. (Courtesy of 5DT/Fifth Dimension
Technologies.)The term virtual prototype describes 3D CAD systems that represent the
object realistically enough for users, designers, and manufacturers to get the
same type of information they get from creating a physical prototype.
As more sophisticated software becomes available to analyze, animate, and
predict the behavior of the design under various physical conditions, the 3D
CAD model becomes a better representation of the final object—and better
suited for testing and study.
3D CAD models offer a high degree of accuracy and measurability and a
high degree of flexibility. Each new generation of CAD software automates
more common tasks, allowing the designer to focus more on the design and
less on the mechanics of changing the model. This flexibility allows the
CAD model to become a preliminary work that is refined and tested until it
is ready to be used as a plan for the final product.
The ability of 3D CAD models to be used throughout the process, serve in
lieu of a physical model, and be reused and modified indefinitely makes
them very cost effective, especially in designing mechanical assemblies.
However, not all 3D CAD models are the same. Familiarity with different
types of 3D modeling systems lets you select the method and software most
suitable for your design project.
5.3 Types of 3D ModelsEach of the major 3D modeling methods—wireframe modeling, surface
modeling, solid modeling, and parametric constraint-based modeling—has
its advantages and disadvantages. Many CAD systems incorporate all these
modeling methods into one single software package. Other software may
provide only one or two of these methods.
Wireframe Models
Wireframe modeling represents the edges and contours of an object using
lines, circles, and arcs oriented in 3D space. 3D wireframe drawings can be
easy to create, are handled by many low-cost software packages, and
provide a good tool for modeling simple 3D shapes. The method gets its
name from the appearance of the model, which resembles a sculpture made
of wires, as shown in Figure 5.14.5.14 A Wireframe Model. Edges and contours of an object are represented by lines, circles, and
arcs oriented in 3D space. 3D wireframe is a suitable method for modeling this snow-melting system.
You create a wireframe model in much the same way that you create a 2D
CAD drawing. Each edge where surfaces on the object intersect is drawn in
3D space using simple geometric tools, such as a 3D line or arc. The X-, Y-,
and Z-coordinates for the endpoints are stored in the database along with
the type of entity.
3D wireframes can quickly display process control, piping, sheet metal
parts, mechanical linkages, and layout drawings showing criticaldimensions that use relatively simple geometric shapes. Interferences and
clearance distances are difficult to visualize in 2D piping drawings. It can
be critical that they are not overlooked in the design. For example, to
quickly check clearances for the design of an electrical substation, the
engineer may create a wireframe model of the high-voltage conductors to
ensure that conductors are not too close to other equipment that could
produce an electrical arc, causing a short.
A 3D wireframe can be useful for piping layout around other 3D
equipment, which can be difficult to visualize in 2D. The centerline of the
pipe is easy to represent in a 3D wireframe, as shown in Figure 5.14. This
prevents problems with clearances that are acceptable in two dimensions,
but not in a third. For a system with moving parts or where complex shapes
need to fit, a different 3D modeling method may better allow you to assess
interferences.
Wireframe models do not include surfaces that can be shaded, so they are
not realistic looking. Because you can see through the model, some shapes
cannot be represented unambiguously, and it may be difficult to see from a
single view which areas are holes and which are surfaces. The model in
Figure 5.15 shows a wireframe model. Without rotating or checking
coordinate locations, you may visualize the part as showing the hole from
the top or the bottom (Figure 5.16).5.15 Are you looking at the model from above or from below?
5.16 Adding faces to a wireframe model removes the ambiguity about the features.
Before you can measure oblique edges and surfaces in a 2D drawing, you
must first create an auxiliary view showing that feature true size. The true
size is already contained in the 3D wireframe and can be measured directly.
For example, the length of edge A in Figure 5.17 can be determined from
this 2D AutoCAD drawing only in the auxiliary view. The 3D wireframe
model of the same part can show the length of the edge directly.5.17 (a) The 2D CAD drawing displays the true length of line A in an auxiliary view. (b) The length
of the line in the 3D wireframe model can be determined directly from the model.

Wireframe Modeler versus Wireframe Display
Wireframe modeling was the first 3D modeling method. Its depiction of
edges and contours grew out of 2D modeling practices. The term
“wireframe” is also used to describe an economical way of displaying a
model on the computer screen in which just the edges and contours are
shown. Representing objects on the screen using wireframe display is
simpler and faster than showing shaded views. The computing power
needed to generate and display a model was a constraint in the design of
CAD modeling systems. Wireframe representation was developed when
multimedia displays common on home computers today were available only
on powerful mainframes. As computers evolved, computationally intensive
modeling techniques became feasible. Display methods such as shadedviews, shaded views with edges, hidden line-removed views, and others can
be generated from the data. There is still a trade-off between complexity
and speed; more complex and detailed information means more processor
time.
CAD modelers address this trade-off by representing the model data in two
ways: first, as it is stored in the database (the coordinate locations for each
entity in the model, for example) and second, as it will be displayed on the
screen. The economy of wireframe display makes it a good choice for
working with computer models—whatever the underlying modeling
method. Surface, solid, and constraint-based modelers all offer a wireframe
display and a range of tools for controlling that display. Each of them,
however, creates a database with more information than can be found in that
created by a wireframe modeler, which stores only vertex and edge
information.
Surface Models
CAD surface models define a shape by storing its surface information. A
surface model is similar to an empty box. The outer surfaces of the part are
defined (although unlike an actual box, these surfaces do not have any
material thickness). Because the surfaces are defined, they can be shaded to
provide a realistic appearance.Surface modelers are traditionally used by industrial designers and stylists
who create the outside envelope for a device. These designers need
modeling tools that convey a realistic image of the final product. Software
tools developed for their use focused first on the challenge of modeling the
exterior of the product, not the mechanical workings within. Many surface
modelers offer specialized tools for lighting and rendering a model, so
designers can create photorealistic images that cannot be distinguished from
the actual product (see Figure 5.18).5.18 A Rendered Surface Model. The industrial designer for the Timex TurnAndPull alarm was
concerned that the inner rings would look too deep or too busy. A rendered surface model allowed
team members to see how it would look when manufactured. (Courtesy of Timex Group USA, Inc.)Concurrent engineering and the use of the 3D CAD database as the product
description contributed to the development of modeling software that
satisfies the aesthetic needs of industrial designers as well as the functional
information needed by engineers. Understanding surface modeling
techniques will help you assess the kinds of features that are available in
your modeler—and whether a dedicated surface modeler is required.
Surface Information in the Database
Most surface modeling software stores a list of a part’s vertices and how
they connect to form edges in the CAD database. The surfaces between
them are generated mathematically from the lines, curves, and points that
define them. Some surface modelers store additional information to indicate
which is the inside and which is the outside of the surface. This is often
done by storing a surface normal, a directional line perpendicular to the
outside of the surface. This allows the model to be shaded and rendered
more easily.
Storing the definitions of the surfaces in the CAD digital database is termed
boundary representation (BREP), meaning that the information contained
in the database represents the external boundaries of the surfaces making up
the 3D model. Remember that these surfaces have no thickness.
The following are basic methods used to create surface models:
Extrusion and revolutionMeshes
Spline approximations
Extruded and Revolved Surfaces
You can define a surface by a 2D shape or profile and the path along which
it is revolved or extruded.
Figure 5.19 shows a surface model created by revolution, and the profile
and axis of revolution used to generate it. Regular geometric entities can be
revolved or extruded to create surface primitives such as cones, cylinders,
and planes. Surface primitives are sometimes built into surface modeling
software to be used as building blocks for complex shapes.5.19 Revolved Surface. The surface model in (a) was created by revolving the profile about the axis
shown in (b).
MeshesMesh surfaces are defined by the 3D location of each vertex stored in the
CAD database. Each group of vertices is used to define a flat plane surface.
Figure 5.20 shows a mesh surface and a list of some of its vertices.
5.20 A Mesh Surface. A mesh surface is composed of a series of planar surfaces defined by a
matrix of vertices, as shown in (c). The wireframe view of the mesh in (a) appears more like a surface
in the rendered view shown in (b).
Some mesh surfaces are called triangulated irregular networks (TINs),
because they connect sets of three vertices with triangular faces to serve as
the surface model. A mesh surface can be useful for modeling uneven
surfaces, such as terrain, where a completely smooth surface is not
necessary. A sufficiently large matrix will result in correspondingly smaller
triangles that can better approximate a smooth surface. Refining the mesh
will produce a smoother surface, but the size of the CAD file will increase
and result in slower software performance. Some modeling packages allow
you to define a smoothed representation of the surface instead of the
somewhat bumpy appearance of a strictly mesh surface.
NURBS-Based SurfacesThe mathematics of nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) curves
underlies the method used to create surfaces in most surface modeling
systems. A NURBS surface is defined by a set of vertices in 3D space that
are used to define a smooth surface mathematically.
Rational curves and surfaces have the advantage that they can be used to
generate not only free-form curves but also analytical forms such as arcs,
lines, cylinders, and planes. This is an advantage for surface modelers that
use NURBS techniques, as the database does not need to accommodate
different techniques for surfaces created using a surface primitive, mesh,
extrusion, or revolution.
Spline curves can be used as input for revolved and extruded surfaces that
can be lofted or swept. Lofting is the term used to describe a surface fit to a
series of curves that do not cross each other. Sweeping creates a surface by
sweeping a curve or cross section along one or more “paths.” In both cases,
the surface blends from the shape of one curve to the next (see Figure 5.21).5.21 Lofting. A lofted surface (a) blends a series of curves that do not intersect into a smooth
surface. A swept surface (b) sweeps a curve along a curved path and blends the influence of both into
a smooth surface model.
NURBS surfaces can also be created by meshing curves that run
perpendicular to each other, as illustrated in Figure 5.22.

defining each curve are blended. (Courtesy of Robert Mesaros.)

Visible Embryo Heart ModelBy modeling embryonic hearts at different stages, researchers were able to
use the models to examine the way different tissue layers expand and move
as the heart develops. To study blood flow in developing hearts that are only
0.8 millimeter across, Kent Thornburg and Jeffrey Pentecost created models
from which they generated a 5-centimeter-wide stereolithography physical
model.

Research Center, at Oregon Health Sciences University, with the

Reverse EngineeringMost reverse engineering software traces a physical object to generate mesh
data, or data points for a surface model. Points on the object are captured as
vertices, then translated into a digital surface representation. Reverse
engineering can be an easy way to capture the surface definition of an
existing model. Designers might use traditional surface sculpting methods
and then digitize the physical model to create a digital database. An existing
part might be reverse engineered so that it can be added to the CAD
database. (Figure 5.23 shows data for the surface model in Figure 5.24
being created using a reverse engineering process.)

5.23 Digitizing a Model. A coordinate measuring system was used to digitize the clay model of the
Romulus Predator. Seventeen hundred data points were captured by digitizing half of the quarter￾scale clay model of the Predator. Digitizing the data and mirroring it in the model ensured side-to￾side symmetry. (Courtesy of Mark Gerisch.)
images
5.24 Surface Patches. The lines on the surface model of the Predator prototype indicate individual
surface patches that make up the model. Areas of the car with drastic curvature changes are divided
into smaller patches, which keeps the mathematical order of the patches lower and reduces the
overall complexity of the surface. (Courtesy of Mark Gerisch.)
Complex Surfaces/Combining Surfaces
To create a surface model, you do not create the entire surface at once—just
patches to combine into a continuous model. Just as curves can be made of
individual segments that are smoothed into a continuous curve, surfaces canbe made of entities referred to as patches. Like a spline curve, a patch can
be interpolated, or approximated.
A Coon’s patch is a simple interpolated surface that is bounded by four
curves. Mathematical methods interpolate the points on the four boundary
curves to determine the vertices of the resulting patch (see Figure 5.25).
images
5.25 Coon’s Patch. The lines between the boundary curves in this Coon’s patch surface represent
the shape of the surface and illustrate the influence of the boundary curves on the interpolated
surface between them.
Surface patches are joined by blending the edges of the patches. Areas
created by blending, or the surfaces created by fillets, corners, or offsets, are
called derived surfaces. They are defined by mathematical methods that
combine the edges of the patches to create a smooth joint.
Sometimes, complex surface patches are created by trimming. For example,
a circular patch may start with a rectangular patch, then be trimmed to a
circle, and finally be blended with other surface patches.
Some surface modeling systems include the use of Boolean operations,
whereas others do not. Systems that do not include Boolean operations or
good tools for trimming surfaces can be difficult to use to create a feature
such as a round hole through a curved surface because the exact shape of
the surface, including the hole, must be defined by specifying its edges.Editing Surfaces
Once a surface has been defined, editing depends on the method used by the
surface modeler to create and store the surface. Usually, the information
describing the locations of vertices is editable, and each vertex can be
changed. If the surface modeling software retains the original 2D profile
that was extruded or revolved to produce the surface, it can be used to
facilitate changes to these surfaces. If not, it can be difficult to efficiently
edit the surfaces.
For NURBS surfaces, each control point can be edited to produce local
changes in the surface model. (Editing Bezier surfaces, by the same token,
produces global changes to the surface.) Grabbing and relocating vertices is
a highly intuitive way to edit a surface model that contributes to its
usefulness in refinement. The term “tweaking” is used to describe editing a
model by adjusting control points individually to see the result. For
example, the NURBS surfaces used to define the shape of the Predator’s
exterior made it easy to use the surface model to explore design options in
several areas (Figure 5.26).

the control points in the surface model in real time until the scoop looked just right on screen.

Surface Model AccuracySurface model information can be stored with more or less accuracy.
Compare the meshes shown in Figure 5.27. The mesh at left contains fewer
vertices than the mesh shown in 5.27b. Although the surface shown in
5.27b is more accurate, the additional information makes its file size larger.
This requires more computer processing to store and interact with the
model. Depending on your purpose, the smaller number of vertices may be
satisfactory.
images
5.27 Accuracy and Surface Mesh. The mesh in (a) has fewer vertices and larger facets than the
mesh used in (b). The finer mesh in (b) more accurately represents the cylindrical shape of the bolt.
Surface models used for computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) require a
high degree of accuracy to produce smooth surfaces. The trade-off between
speed and accuracy may be resolved by setting the surface display to a less
accurate faceted representation and storing a smoothed or more highly
defined surface definition in the database. It is important to distinguish
between the screen display of the model and the surface definition stored in
the database.
Splines used to create surfaces can also vary in accuracy. Splines can have
more or fewer control points that you can use to shape the surface. To
model surfaces smoothly, fewer control points may allow more fluid curves.
A mesh surface used to calculate area may not be as accurate as one created
using a smoothing algorithm such as NURBS or Bezier.Tessellation lines are used to indicate surfaces in a wireframe view, and
they may or may not reflect the accuracy of the surface (see Figure 5.28). It
is important to distinguish when tessellation lines represent the accuracy of
the view of the model, and when they represent the accuracy of the model
stored in the database. If the software accurately represents the actual
geometry of the model in the model database, the tessellations simply
represent the model in the on-screen view.

smooth curves.
Using Surface Models
The primary strength of a surface model is improved appearance of surfaces
and the ability to convey these complex definitions for computer-aided
manufacturing. Customers purchase products not only on their function but
also on their styling. A realistically shaded model can be used with potential
customers to determine their reactions to its appearance. Lighting and
different materials can be applied in most surface modeling software to
create very realistic looking results (Figure 5.29). Many consumer products
often start with the surface model, then the interior parts are engineered to
fit the shape of the styled exterior. When surface models can be used in
place of a physical prototype—or in place of the product itself for
promotional purposes—the savings add to their cost effectiveness.images
5.29 This docking station illustrates the complex curves possible in a surface model. (Image courtesy of
©2016 Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks Corporation.)
Because the relative locations of surfaces from a particular direction of
sight can be calculated, surface modeling systems can automatically remove
back edges (or represent them as hidden lines). Surface definitions remove
the ambiguity inherent in some wireframe models and allow you to see
holes and front surfaces by hiding the nonvisible parts of the model.
The complex surfaces defined by a surface model can be exported to
numerically controlled machines, making it possible to manufacture
irregular shapes that would be difficult to document consistently in 2D
views. Both surface and solid models can be used to check for fit and
interference before the product is manufactured. Often, surface models can
be converted to solid models and vice versa.
Because surface models define surfaces, they can often report the surface
area of a part. This information can be useful in calculating heat transfer
rates, for example, and can save time, particularly when the surface is
complex. The accuracy of the calculations may depend on the method used
by the software to store the surface data.
Complex surfaces can be difficult to model. The cost-effectiveness of
surface modeling depends on the difficulty of the surface, the accuracy
required, and the purpose for which the model will be used. Many modelingsoftware systems offer a combination of wireframe, surface, and solid
modeling capabilities, making it possible to weigh the benefits against the
difficulties and the time required to create each type of model.
Solid Models
Solid models go beyond surface models to store information about the
volume contained inside the object. They store the vertex and edge
information of the 3D wireframe modeler, the surface definitions of the
surface modeler, plus volume information. Many solid modelers also store
the operations used to create features, which makes it possible to edit them
quickly (see Figures 5.30 and 5.31). Solid models closely approximate
physical models, making them especially useful for defining, testing, and
refining the designs they represent.
images
5.30 Order Matters. The order of operations matters when you use Boolean operations to create a
solid model—and when you edit it (see Figure 5.31).
images
5.31 Joining A and B after the hole is created by subtracting C changes the design—the hole no
longer goes through the entire part.
Tip
Understanding basic modeling methods will help you assess the modeling
software of tomorrow. Some new modelers, referred to as “direct” or“explicit” modelers, such as Creo and SpaceClaim, offer a broad command
set that adopts features from traditional surface and solid modelers.
Using 3D Solid Models
Many of the examples so far illustrated how accurate representation of a 3D
object provides valuable engineering information. Solid models are highly
visual and easy to understand and measure. They are also highly accurate if
modeled accurately. Solid models are often able to replace physical models,
as well as control CAM equipment, which adds to their cost-effectiveness.
In addition, 3D solid models are particularly suited for use with analysis
packages. They contain all the information about an object’s volume, and
volume is important to many engineering calculations. Mass properties,
centroid, moments of inertia, and weight can be calculated from the solid
model as often as needed during the refinement process. The system
behavior can be simulated from the wealth of information available in the
model.
Solid models provide information needed for other analyses. Finite element
analysis (FEA) methods break up a complex object into smaller shapes to
make stress, strain, and heat transfer easier to calculate. Because the solid
model defines the entire object, FEA software can use this information to
generate an FEA mesh automatically for a part. This allows inclusion of this
type of analysis earlier in the design process, incorporation of changes, and
testing of the new model with FEA analysis again. Some FEA and solidmodeling packages are integrated to provide this analysis within the
modeling software. Others even allow direct model optimization based on
the FEA results, creating a new version of the model that the designer can
then revise further.
5.4 Constraint-Based Modeling
Constraint-based modeling has several advantages for engineering design.
As the design evolves, constraint-based models can be updated by changing
the sizes and relationships that define the model. In traditional solid
modeling methods, changing the size of one feature may require several
others to be changed, or the model may need to be totally re-created.
Because of the iterative nature of the design process, a design is repeatedly
modified as it is refined. The model’s responsiveness can result in more
cycles during the refinement stage (or more cycles in less time) and,
ultimately, a better design.
Neptune Seatech Oy made the decision to switch from a 2D design method
to a constraint-based 3D modeler, SolidWorks, so it could get its products to
market faster while preserving the iterations needed for complex, accurate
designs. Neptune Seatech is a Finnish engineering company that specializes
in the design of vehicles for subsea applications—passenger and research
submarines. To meet increasingly rigorous design, performance, and safety
standards, the company found 2D methods made it hard to complete the
desired number of design iterations and still meet product developmentdeadlines. Its first project using the constraint-based 3D modeler, a floating
bridge for ferries, took only 18 weeks to produce (see Figure 5.32).
images
5.32 Neptune Seatech’s parametric model of the floating bridge for ferries was modified to create a
family of designs for the variations in ferry landings. (Courtesy of Neptune Seatech Oy.)
The company enjoyed two other benefits of constraint-based modeling.
First, the ease with which constraint-based models can be updated makes it
possible to create families of designs. Neptune’s floating bridge allows cars
to pass from the ferry to land and vice versa during loading and unloading.
Because each landing site is slightly different, the main dimensions of a
given bridge vary slightly from one site to another. The bridge manufacturer
that hired Neptune had several designs previously created for specific
landing sites. To eliminate confusion in manufacturing, the customer
wanted a design that could be updated for new bridges. Neptune proposed
to design one bridge, then produce the others by changing the length and
width factors. The constraint-based model of the bridge made it easy to
change the pertinent dimensions and have the software update the related
parts to a new size. The investment in the bridge model was used to refine
the original bridge design, then used again as a starting point for variations
in the product family (see Figure 5.33).
images
5.33 Neptune Seatech’s bridge model, created in SolidWorks, involved more than 1700 parts.
(Courtesy of Neptune Seatech Oy.)Neptune also enjoyed the software’s ability to analyze mass properties. The
weight and volume data for a floating bridge need to be evaluated during
design so that the resulting bridge floats at the correct level. Calculating the
weight of a floating bridge design would have taken 1 to 2 weeks using
Neptune’s previous methods, but the built-in capabilities of SolidWorks
made it possible to monitor this data throughout the design process. The
ease with which the model could be modified made it possible to analyze
the model, make changes, and analyze the model again. The software also
made it possible for analysis to occur earlier in the design process, allowing
more time to optimize the design.
Constraint-based modeling also improves designs by focusing the modeler
on the design intent for the product. If a constraint-based model is to be
updated successfully when changes are made, the rules for building the
model must capture the intended design solution for the system or device.
The extra attention and planning required to capture design intent in the
model makes the designer carefully consider the function and purpose of
the item being designed, which in turn results in better designs.
5.5 Constraints Define the Geometry
In a constraint-based model, an object’s features are defined by sizes and
geometric relationships stored in the model and used to generate the part.
Two basic kinds of constraints are used to drive the model geometry.Size constraints are the dimensions that define the model. The choice of
dimensions and their placement is an important aspect of capturing the
design intent.
Geometric constraints define and maintain the geometric properties of
an object, such as tangency, verticality, and so on. These geometric
constraints are equally important in capturing design intent.
In constraint-based modeling, a parameter is a named quantity whose value
can change; it is similar to a variable. Like a variable, a parameter can be
used to define other parameters. If the length of a part is always twice the
width, you can define its size as “2× Width,” where Width is the name of
the dimension.
Unlike a variable, a parameter is never abstract: it always has a value
assigned to it, so that the model can be represented. For example, the
parameter Width is defined by a value, such as 3.5. The value for the length
parameter is calculated based on the Width, so in this case Length is 7. If the
width value is changed to 5, the length is automatically updated to the new
value of “Width * 2,” or 10 (see Figure 5.34).
images
5.34 Once the parameter changes, the shape is updated.
Even something as simple as this rectangular block may have design intent
built into its model. As it is being updated, do you want the center of thepart to stay fixed and the part to elongate in both directions, or do you want
it to lengthen all in one direction? If so which end should stay put?
Figure 5.35 shows a part that has been modeled in a 3D constraint-based
design package. The parameters driving the geometry of the model are
indicated on the drawing. When the parameter value for the length of the
part was changed, the part was updated automatically, as shown in part b of
the figure. Notice that the threaded length did not increase. If you wanted
the thread length to increase as the bolt was lengthened, you would need to
define the constraints and parameters differently.images
5.35 When the length dimension increased to .750, the part was updated to reflect this new size
constraint. Notice that the threaded length remained the same and the bolt head remained attached
after the update. The modeler maintained the size and geometric relationships that were defined.

Feature DimensionsDimensions in a constraint-based model can behave in different ways. A
dimension can be:
A size constraint: changing the dimension value updates the model
feature. These are often called driving dimensions.
A parameter used in an equation that “drives” the size of a model
feature.
A reference dimension, which gets its value from the model geometry,
but is not a size constraint for the model. These are often called driven
dimensions.
A dimension that is purely a text note on a drawing or model view and
whose value may not relate to the model geometry.
A combination of the above.
Driving Dimensions
Driving dimensions control the size of a feature element in the model. Each
driving dimension has two components: its name and its numerical value.
Naming the dimensions allows them to be used in equations or relations
that define other parts of the model geometry. The numerical value may be
entered as a number in the definition of the dimension, or it may be derived
from an equation. Figure 5.36a shows the shaft support part with its
dimension values displayed; Figure 5.36b shows the same part with the
dimension names. The constraint-based modeling software allows you to
switch between display of numeric and named dimensions in your model.Some modelers also allow you to show the dimensions so that they reveal
the formulas used to relate dimensions to one another.
images images
5.36 Two Ways to Display Dimensions in the Constraint-Based Model. (a) The numerical display
shows the current value for the dimensions. (b) Showing the parameter name can help you locate
dimension names to be used in the dimension for another entity.
Formulas in Dimensions
Like the geometric constraints in the model, the size parameters create
relationships between features of the part that can be captured in formulas.
For example, if you wanted to maintain a constant material thickness
around the outside of a central hole with diameter d2, you could enter the
equation d1 = d2 + 1.00 for the diameter of the outer cylinder. Doing so
ensures that the driven dimension (d1) will be 1.00 overall more than d2 no
matter what value is entered for d2.
Another example is adding four holes to a rectangular base plate that should
be centered 0.75 inch away from the edge of the plate. If the width of the
plate changes, the hole locations should also. Defining the location of the
holes using the equation h _ location = width/2 − .75, where width is
the plate’s width dimension and h_location is given from the center of the
part, will make the holes stay in the same relative positions. To change the
distance from the edge from .75 to 1.00, you would just update the equation
and regenerate the model.Equations in constraint-based dimensions generally use operators similar to
those used in a spreadsheet or other programming notation. Many modelers
make it easy to import to and export dimension values from an outside
application, such as a spreadsheet. Complex formulas can be used to
calculate sizes in the spreadsheet or other program, and the resulting values
can be imported back into the modeling package. Each modeling package
has its own notation and syntax. Table 5.1 lists operators that can be used in
equations in SolidWorks. Most modelers have a similar list.

It is important to keep track of the relationships you create. Most software
allows you to name and document your constraint-based dimensions so you
(and your colleagues) can interpret parameter names more readily. The
software will generate a name for each dimension by default, but you
should give key dimensions recognizable names so they are easier to
interpret.
Parameters that are common to more than one part in an assembly are called
global parameters. Naming global parameters that can be used throughout
an assembly is a powerful means of ensuring that parts work together and
that critical dimensions are updated in all parts of an assembly. With global
parameters, it is even more important to choose names that are clear and to
document their purpose in the notes field.
Driven and Cosmetic DimensionsDriven or reference dimensions are associated with the model geometry but
are not used to create the constraint-based model. Sometimes it is necessary
to add a dimension to a drawing that was not needed to create the model. A
driven dimension is a one-way link from the database; it cannot be used to
change the model, but it will be updated if the model changes.
A cosmetic dimension has no link to the model; it is simply a text label. To
dimension a feature at a size different from what is in the model, you must
use a cosmetic dimension or otherwise break the link to the database value
for the feature.
You should not often need driven dimensions. A well-created constraint￾based model contains all the dimensional relationships needed.
Using the shaft support as an example again, a relationship can be defined
so the diameter of the hole is always 1 inch smaller than the diameter of the
cylinder. Changing the size of the cylinder will cause the diameter of the
hole to change to preserve the size relationship.
Feature-Based Modeling
Constraint-based modeling is also called feature-based modeling because
its models are combinations of features. Creating a constraint-based model
is similar to creating any other solid model. However, in constraint-based
modeling the resulting part is derived from the dimensions and constraintsthat define the geometry of the features. Each time a change is made, the
part is re-created from these definitions. Individual features and their
relationships to one another make up the constraint-based model.
A feature is the basic unit of a constraint-based solid model. Each feature
has properties that define it. When you create a feature, you specify the
geometric constraints that apply to it, then specify the size parameters. The
modeler stores these properties and uses them to generate the feature. If an
element of the feature, or a related part of the model, changes, the modeling
software regenerates the feature in accordance with the defining properties
assigned to it. For example, an edge that is defined to be tangent to an arc
will move to preserve the tangency constraint if the size of the arc is
changed.
Some features, such as holes and fillets, may use predefined features with
additional properties that are maintained as the model is updated. For
example, a “through hole” (one that goes completely through the part
feature) will be extended if the part thickness increases.
When you look at the fixed-height shaft support shown in Figure 5.37a, can
you identify the features that make up its shape? Figure 5.37b shows the
major cylinder, hole, plate, end plate, slot, and rounds that form the model
of the shaft support.
images images5.37 The features that make up the support in (a) are shown individually in (b).
Being able to update models easily to reflect changes in the design is a key
ability of constraint-based modelers. If you are not using a constraint-based
solid modeling program, you may have to re-create the feature just to
change a size. This can result in considerable time and effort, especially for
interrelated features.
In addition to defining relationships between features, constraint-based
modeling software also allows you to use constraints and parameters across
parts in an assembly. Thus, when a part changes, any related parts in the
assembly can also be updated. Because the software regenerates the features
and parts from the relationships stored in the database (see Figure 5.38),
planning constraint-based relationships that reflect the design intent of the
part or product is the key to efficient and useful constraint-based models.
images
5.38 Model Tree. The window at the left side of the screen called the “model tree” (enlarged here)
lists the features in the order in which they were created. The icon next to the feature indicates the
operation used to create the feature. Extrusions and extruded cuts were used to form the cylinder,
baseplate, and hole. Then, the end feature was extruded and the slot created using an extruded cut.
Finally, fillets were added to round the edges.
5.6 Planning Parts for Design Flexibility
Design intent refers to the key dimensions and relationships that must be
met by the part. Where does the part need to fit into other parts? Do certain
features need to align with other features? How will the part change as thedesign evolves? By thinking about these relationships, you can organize the
features so that the structure of the part and its relationships are the
foundation for later features. Four key aspects of planning for design intent
are summarized in Figure 5.39. Of course, you cannot know everything
about a design before you begin, and there will be changes that will require
more work than others; but starting your model with the geometric
relationships in the design in mind will allow you to benefit from the power
of constraint-based modeling. To see how a constraint-based model can
reflect design intent, you should understand some basics about constraint￾based modeling software.

5.39 Four Key Considerations When Planning a Constraint-Based Model
Constraint-based modeling software in many ways parallels the design
process. To start creating a part, you often start with a 2D sketch of the key
shape of a feature, such as that shown in Figure 5.40. The initial sketch may
be rough in appearance because the software will apply constraints to define
the relationships between the simple 2D geometric elements of your sketch.
This process is similar to the way one of your engineering colleagues
interprets your hand-drawn sketches. If lines appear to be perpendicular or
nearly so, your colleague assumes that you mean them to be perpendicular,
without your having to mark the angular dimension between the lines. In a
similar way, constraint-based modelers apply constraints to your rough
sketch, so that lines that appear nearly perpendicular, parallel, vertical,horizontal, concentric, or collinear will have a constraint relationship added
to them so that they function that way in the model. This process is called
“solving” the sketch in some modeling software, because the software is
interpreting and assigning dimensions and constraints to generate a 2D
“profile” of the feature. Before you generate the actual feature, you can
review and change the dimensions and geometric constraints so they are
what you intended. This step is key to defining your design intent. The
sketch constraints in Figure 5.40 have already been added.
images
5.40 A constrained sketch is used as the basis for a model feature. Geometric constraints are
identified by the blue symbols.
To generate a 3D feature, you then select a command to extrude, revolve,
sweep, or blend the profile geometry. Figure 5.41 shows the profile in
Figure 5.40 as it would appear after being (a) extruded, (b) swept, (c)
revolved, and (d) lofted to create different types of features from the 2D
sketch.
images images images images
5.41 Same Sketch, Different Operations. The same sketch was used to create each of these features.
The sketch in (a) was extruded, in (b) swept along a curved path, in (c) revolved 360° about an axis,
and in (d) lofted between the sketch and a second sketch with angled lines and a straight top.
5.7 Sketch ConstraintsConstraint-based modeling software starts by automatically interpreting
your sketch, to define the constraints that it will hold constant. To do so, it
evaluates your sketch against a set of rules stored in the software. A line,
for example, that is drawn within 3° or 4° of being horizontal will be
constrained to remain horizontal. Your sketch will be altered so the line you
drew is, in fact, horizontal. The software will apply the constraints it needs
to solve the sketch.
Constraint-based modeling programs allow you to review the constraints
that are applied to the sketch geometry so you can change them to those
needed to reflect your design intent. Table 5.2 describes some possible
sketch constraints and shows symbols often used to indicate them on
screen. (Different modelers use different symbols and means of displaying
the constraints—see Table 5.3 and Figure 5.42). These constraints may
create relationships to other lines in the sketch or to geometry in an existing
feature.

5.42 Changing Constraint Defaults. The Constraint Settings dialog box in AutoCAD lets you change
the priority in which the constraints are applied. You can also set the tolerance for sketched
endpoints to be considered coincident, and lines to be assumed horizontal or vertical. Understanding
which assumptions are being applied to your sketch can help you define the exact geometry you
require. (Autodesk screen shots reprinted courtesy of Autodesk, Inc.)
Step by Step
Constraining a Sketch
Like a hand-drawn sketch, the sketch for a constraint-based model captures
the basic geometry of the feature as it would appear in a 2D view.
images Sketch the basic shapes as you would see them in a 2D view.
Many modelers will automatically constrain the sketch as you draw unless
you turn this setting off in the software.
images
images Apply geometric constraints to define the geometry of the sketch.
If it is important to your design intent that lines remain parallel, add that
constraint. If arcs must remain tangent to lines, apply that constraint. Here,
lines A and B have been defined to be parallel; note the parallel constraint
symbol.
imagesimages Add dimensional constraints. The length of line B was sketched
so that the software interpreted the dimensional constraint to be 3.34. The
designer changed this dimension to 3.75 (the desired length), and the length
of the line was updated to the new length.
images
Tip
It is often useful to start drawing the feature near the final size required.
Otherwise if the software is automatically constraining your sketch, a line
segment that is proportionately much shorter may become hard to see or
even considered effectively zero length and deleted by the software.
Not all constraint-based modeling programs apply all these constraints, nor
do they apply them in the same fashion. Study the constraints available in
the software you use and determine their effect on the sketch. You also may
be able to set the threshold values for various constraints. For example,
instead of having lines at 1° be automatically constrained as horizontal
lines, you may wish to increase this value to 3° (Figure 5.42). If you are
having difficulty getting the constraints you desire applied to the sketch,
you may want to turn off automatic constraint application and select each
specific constraint to apply to your sketch.Most constraint-based modeling programs let you remove or override a
constraint that is applied, or specify that the geometry is exact as drawn.
Sometimes, you may have to force the sketch closer to the desired
relationship. For example, if two lines are too far off in the sketch to be
constrained as perpendicular by the software, you could add an angular
dimension of 90° between them to force them to that relationship. With the
dimensions driving the geometry to the condition you want, the software
may apply the perpendicular constraint. Once the constraint is applied, you
often can delete the dimension you added.
It is usually beneficial to let geometric constraints determine much of your
sketch geometry, then dimension the sizes and relationships that cannot be
defined using constraints. You could use a constraint-based modeler as you
would a solid modeler, adding dimension values to define all the features,
but this would not build in the intelligence that allows the software to
automate updating the model.
Overconstrained Sketches
Sketches used in constraint-based modeling may not be overconstrained.
An overconstrained or overdimensioned sketch is one that has too many
things controlling its geometry.
The sketch shown in Figure 5.43 is overconstrained. Because the top arc is
constrained to be tangent to both vertical lines, and its radius is
dimensioned (sd0), the width of the sketch is defined. The horizontaldimension shown at the bottom (sd2) defines this width again. If both the
arc radius dimension and the overall width dimension were allowed in the
model and one of them changed, it would be difficult or impossible for the
part to be updated correctly. If the overall width changed and the tangent
constraint or arc radius did not, the sketch geometry would be impossible.
images
5.43 Overconstrained Sketch
Underconstrained Sketches
An underconstrained or underdimensioned sketch is one that has too few
dimensions or constraints and is therefore not fully defined.
The sketch shown in Figure 5.44 is underconstrained. It lacks a height
dimension controlling its vertical size. Without this dimension the sketch is
not fully defined. Some software will allow you to create a 3D feature from
an underconstrained sketch as long as the sketch follows basic rules—for
example, the sketch does not cross itself, and the sketch encloses an area. If
the sketch is underconstrained, the software assumes values for unspecified
dimensions based on the sizes drawn. This can be helpful when you are
trying out ideas, but it is best to plan to create a model that reflects your
design intent.
images
5.44 Underconstrained SketchDimensions can easily be changed by typing a new value, so go ahead and
guess the size and change it later if needed; but keep in mind that choosing
which dimensions to use to define the sketch is a critical aspect of making
sketches and features that will be updated as expected when a dimension
changes.
Applying Constraints
You should select dimensions that define the proper relationships between
the sketched geometry and other existing features in your model. The
surfaces between which you choose to create the dimensions are a large
factor in creating a model that will be updated in the desired manner. You
should not let the rules of your software package determine the dimensions,
as it is unlikely that they will reflect your design intent.
When you are dimensioning a sketch used to create a feature, place the
dimensions where you can view them clearly. Later, if you create a drawing
from your model, you will be able to clean up the appearance of the
dimensions if needed. You can move dimensions, change their placement,
and arrange them so they follow the standard practices. Good placement
practices such as placing dimensions outside the object outline and keeping
the dimensions a reasonable distance from one another will make the
dimensions in your model easier to read.3D models are accepted as final design documentation. When you are going
to use the model as the design database and not provide drawings, it is even
more important to ensure that dimensions and tolerances shown in the
model are clear. You will learn more about practices for documenting inside
the 3D model in Chapter 11.
If you do a good job selecting the dimensions that control the drawing
geometry, you will have little cleanup work to do later when you are
creating drawing views.
Setting the Base Point
Some constraint-based modeling software assumes a base point in the
sketch for the first feature you create. The base point is fixed on the
coordinate system; the other sketch geometry is located on the coordinate
system based on its relationship to this base point. The resulting feature will
stay fixed on the coordinate system at this base point. When dimension
values change, they will change relative to that point. There is only one
base point per model.
The base point is indicated in Figure 5.45a by the × in the lower right
corner of the sketch. When the width dimension changes, the sketch is
updated to the new size while leaving the base point fixed on the
coordinates. The rest of the sketch geometry is reoriented, as shown in
Figure 5.45b.images images
5.45 Base Point. The base point fixes the sketch on the coordinate system in this underconstrained
sketch. The base point serves as a fixed point when the model is updated. In AutoCAD, adding a
Fixed Point constraint lets you identify the base point; otherwise, it is determined by software rules.
If your software uses a base point, it should become the base point for the
entire model. When the model is updated, all dimensions will be updated
from this point. A good rule of thumb is to identify a fixed point on your
model that you would use as a starting point for measuring the part for
inspection purposes. Use this point as the base point, or locate your
dimensions from it as if it were the base point.
Locating most of your dimensions from a common edge or major surface
can be effective for two reasons. First, it helps you create dimensions that
will be useful for inspecting the part after manufacture; the dimension
values in your model will measure from the same point that an inspector
will use to measure the finished part. Second, it helps you anticipate how
the model will be updated. When a value is changed, the features on the
model will be updated (move) relative to the edge referenced in their
dimensions. When you locate dimensions relative to other features you may
have difficulty predicting how the model will be updated because you have
to add the effect of changes to the intermediate features.
More important than any rule of thumb governing dimension selection or
placement is to consider thoroughly the parts you are designing and to make
the drawing geometry, constraints, and dimensions reflect the design intentfor the part. In some cases, dimensioning a part from another feature is
required to reflect the design intent. Figure 5.46 shows two sketches that
have the same geometry but are dimensioned differently. When the 2.00
height dimension is changed to 2.50, how will each of these drawings be
updated?
images images
5.46 These two sketches of the same part have very different relations built into the dimensions for
the sketch. The sketch in (a) relates all dimensions to the left and bottom edges of the part. The sketch
in (b) has a chain of relationships built into the dimensions.
In the first case, shown in Figure 5.46a, the height of the 2.00 “step” will
change to 2.50, narrowing the gap between it and the 3.00 step. In Figure
5.46b, the height of the 2.00 step will change to 2.50, and the height of the
next step will be updated to 3.50 units so it remains 1.00 unit above it. In
this case, the narrow gap will occur between the 3.50 and the 4.00 step.
Either is correct to the extent that it reflects the intended design.
5.8 The Base Feature
To create useful relationships in a constraint-based model, it is helpful to
start out your model with a good base feature. The base feature is the first
feature you create. The other features are created using relationships that
locate them to the base feature. Subsequent features are updated based on
their relationships to the base feature or to one another. You should
generally choose a fairly large, significant feature as the base feature.Figure 5.47 shows the cylinder that could be created as the base feature for
the shaft support and the other features that will relate to it. The major
cylinder would make a good base feature because it is a significant feature
of this part, and the other features make sense related to it. If the design
intent of the part centers on the cylinder, its size and location determine the
size and shape of other features. The width of the base plate will depend on
the stability needed for the size of the cylinder. The hole for the shaft must
be centered inside the cylinder and sized to leave enough remaining
material for the wall thickness. Using the cylinder as the base feature also
makes sense from the standpoint of the part’s role within a larger assembly,
as its size could depend on the shaft being designed in a different part. By
building your model around the major cylinder, you make it possible to
update all features automatically if the cylinder size changes.
images
5.47 Base Feature. The major cylinder for the shaft support makes a good base feature because the
cylindrical shaft to be supported is an important aspect of this design.
Adding Features to the Model
When you add features to the model, the way you constrain the sketch
determines how it relates to the other features. Just as the base point serves
to locate the base feature, at least one of the constraints applied to
subsequent sketches must tell the software how the new feature relates to an
existing feature.To create the second feature, you can use a dimension to locate it relative to
an existing edge or use a geometric constraint to align one of the sketch
entities to the existing geometry. For example, you could dimension the
center point of a hole to be a certain distance from the end of an existing
feature or constrain the hole to be concentric to a cylinder or arc on an
existing feature.
The way you dimension, constrain, or align your second feature determines
how it will be updated with respect to the first feature. Use the things you
know about the design to add features. Where are the fixed points on the
model, and how does the feature you are adding relate to them? What are
the conditions that the new feature needs to satisfy at all times? If existing
features were to change, how would the feature you are adding need to
change? In some cases, a simple dimension from an existing edge may be
all that is needed to add the feature. In other cases, you will want to build in
geometric or size relationships needed in the design. The basic process of
constraint-based part modeling is illustrated in Figure 5.48. Starting with
the base feature, you build a model by adding features and relating them to
existing features. For each feature, the same basic process applies.
images
5.48 Flowchart of Constraint-Based Modeling
SpotlightUse an Existing Edge
Pro/ENGINEER (as well as many other modelers) has a sketch command
that allows you to specify an edge on an existing feature to project as a line
in your sketch. This command creates the line in the sketch and constrains
the sketched line to be collinear with the existing geometry in a single step.
Even better, if the edge on the feature moves, the sketched entity moves
with it to stay in alignment.

Parent-Child Relationships
Constraint-based modeling software stores information about each feature
and its relationship to its parent feature. The term parent-child relationship
is used to describe how one feature is derived from another feature. This
relationship is defined by the geometric constraints applied to the sketch as
well as its dimensioned size constraints. Planning when creating a parent￾child relationship is important.
The base feature is the parent feature for the next feature created from it.
Just as real children depend on their parents, child features are dependent on
their parent features. If a parent feature moves, the child feature moves inrelation to it. For example, when the hole feature was added to the shaft
support part, its location was defined as concentric with the major cylinder.
When the cylinder’s location changes, the hole feature remains concentric
with the cylinder (Figure 5.49). If the hole is located relative to the
baseplate or to some other feature and the cylinder is moved, the hole will
not move with it (Figure 5.50).
images
5.49 The hole is concentric with the cylinder. As the baseplate length increases, the hole remains
concentric.
images
5.50 The hole dimensioned from the right end of the part is in the wrong location when the
baseplate length changes.
If you delete a feature, you will also delete its child features unless you
redefine them so that they are related to a different parent feature. This is
another reason for selecting a good base feature; you do not want the first
feature you create to be something that might be deleted later in the design.
Not all features will have child features, but all features other than the base
feature must be related to some parent feature.
One way to visualize the parent-child relationships as you plan your model
is to build a tree diagram. The relationships in the Pivot model in Figure
5.51 are illustrated in the Parent/Child Relationships window. The panel
labeled Children shows that the feature named Notch Cut has Radius as itschild. These features may or may not have children (or “grandchildren”) of
their own. The panel labeled Parents shows that the parent features for
Notch Cut are Sketch2, Main Body, and Chamfer1.

model. Notice how the list of parent and child features from this SolidWorks model shows the
dependencies between features. (Courtesy of Salient Technologies, Inc. (www.salient-tech.com))
Many constraint-based modelers allow you to “play back” the model to see
how it is being generated by the underlying parameters. The sequences
shown in Figure 5.52 and Figure 5.53 illustrate how the features used to
create the parts are ordered in relationships that reflect the design intent for
the parts.

Datum Planes and Surfaces
In engineering drawing, a datum is a theoretically exact point, axis, or
plane. A datum provides a reference surface, axis, or point used for
inspecting the manufactured part. Theoretically exact planes used in
modeling are called datum planes. They are planes used as a reference formodel geometry. You can also create datum axes and datum points in 3D
models. Features can be constrained and dimensioned relative to these
planes, axes, and points, even though they are not solid objects and add no
mass to the model. Some modeling packages provide a set of three mutually
perpendicular datum planes, located so that they pass through the origin of
the coordinate system, as a default. You typically may also create additional
datum planes at other orientations and locations.
Often, it is very useful to use a set of datum planes (three mutually
perpendicular planes) as the base feature in your drawing. In fact, most
software provides them as the default starting features. Figure 5.54 shows
the shaft support part with a set of datum planes used as the base feature.
images
5.54 Datum Planes. The three mutually perpendicular planes in this drawing serve as the base
feature for the model.
One of the benefits of starting with a set of datum planes is that they can
provide a set of normal surfaces that you can use to orient sketch geometry.
This is particularly helpful when there are no planar surfaces on the part
that you can use to build subsequent features easily. With a cylinder as the
base feature for the shaft support, for example, there is no flat surface to
which the end of the base plate can be constrained to be parallel. The datum
plane “Right Plane” in Figure 5.54 provides a reference to which the plate
is parallel.Whether or not you start with a set of datum planes as a base feature,
consider the surfaces that will serve as datum surfaces on your part. Parts
are inspected to see whether they were manufactured acceptably based on a
similar set of three mutually perpendicular, theoretically exact planes.
Measurements of the finished part are taken from surfaces coincident with
one of the datum planes. As you define your features consider the
dimensions that will determine whether the part will fit. How will the part
be measured after manufacture? If there is a surface from which
measurements will be taken, it can be advantageous to identify it as a datum
surface in your part (see Figure 5.55).
images
5.55 Datum Surface. Surface C on this fixture is a datum surface or reference location that will be
used to inspect the location of a part feature. (Courtesy of Mark Perkins.)
Like the base point in a sketch, a datum plane serves as a reference from
which the other features build. When you define a set of datum planes as
the starting point for your model, you will be well on your way when
deciding which datum surface to identify for use in inspecting the finished
part.
Datum surfaces can also be helpful when defining tolerances for features.
Defining your model using the dimensions that will be used to inspect the
finished part will make it easier to determine the impact of variations fromthe stated dimension that occur during manufacture. (You will learn more
about tolerances in Chapter 12.)
Datum planes also provide a common reference point for parts in an
assembly. When parts share a set of datum planes, it is easier to align the
part with other parts when you bring them together in an assembly model. If
you do not use a set of datum planes as a base feature, you can locate new
features from existing surfaces on the base feature.
Creating datum planes, lines, and points as base features can be used as a
strategy called “skeleton modeling” (see Figures 5.56–5.58). Because the
datums have no mass, they do not affect mass property calculations. They
are easy to model and often do not change. For example, if you create a
datum axis that is the centerline of the part, this is unlikely to change,
whereas the shape of the part might. Even when some parts are not fully
modeled or are represented only as a centerline, they can still be assembled
using the datums as references.

lines, and points, which have no mass. (Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)

5.57 Dimensions are added to the constrained sketch defining the basic size relationships. These
dimension values can easily be changed to try out different relationships. (Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)images
5.58 Parts can be assembled to, and even get their sizes directly from, the skeleton. This way parts
can be viewed as assembled, even though all parts are not yet modeled. (Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)
Datum planes and datum surfaces can be added and identified at any time,
but considering them as you plan your model will help you use them more
effectively in capturing design intent in your model.
5.9 Editing the Model
One of the biggest advantages of constraint-based modeling is that you can
edit the features after they are created. If you have several parts open at a
time in your software, you may have to identify which is the active part,
then select the feature you want to edit. Once you select the feature you
wish to edit, the dimensions for the feature are displayed in a way that lets
you change their values. Alternatively, you can also return to the original
sketch that you used to create the feature and modify the sketch. Figure 5.59
shows the shaft support drawing with a change being made to the overall
length of the part.
images
5.59 The length of the shaft support is changed by editing the dimension value and updating the
model.
Depending on how the model was created, you may have more or less
success in updating the model. For example, the baseplate that connects tothe cylinder (indicated in the figure) can be created many different ways.
Each way may have advantages or disadvantages for how the part will be
updated.
Figure 5.60 shows three ways the baseplate could be generated:
images images images
5.60 (a) Extruding upward; (b) extruding to both sides of a center plane; (c) extruding to the
cylinder from an offset plane. All these methods could be used to generate the plate feature for the
shaft support, but they update differently.
1. Sketch the shape of the bottom surface on a sketch plane aligned with
the bottom of the cylinder and extrude it upward.
2. Sketch the cross section on the midplane and extrude to both sides.
3. Sketch the rectangular end view on a plane offset parallel to the center
datum plane and extrude the plate to meet the cylinder feature.
There are several other ways, too. Each of these methods works about the
same when changing the length of the part. They vary if you decide to make
the plate wider than the cylinder. Often, when a feature is extruded to an
existing feature as in Figure 5.60c, the new feature cannot be updated so
that it is wider than the surface to which it is extruded. The boundary, or
end, of the feature is limited by the next surface. Where there is no portion
of the surface at which the feature may end, it will continue to infinity and
therefore be undefined.
Standard FeaturesCertain useful features are part of many engineering designs. Common
features often have specific manufacturing processes developed to form
them efficiently. For example, a counterbore is often used to create a recess
for a bolt head or other fastener. Specific tools like the one shown in Figure
5.61 make it easy to form this feature.
images
5.61 This counterbore tool on a milling machine makes a recess around the top of a hole. The
center of the tool fits inside the hole to keep the counterbore concentric.
Many constraint-based modeling programs use the same terminology for
these features as that used in manufacturing and design. Review the
standard feature types on the next page.
Working with Built-in Features
Many standard features, such as counterbored and countersunk holes,
fillets, lugs, slots, and others may be available in the constraint-based
modeling program as built-in or placed features. These features can be
placed with a dedicated command on part surfaces. Some features are
solids, and others are negative solids that are subtracted from the model (for
example, a cylindrical hole). The features have properties built into them
that the modeling software will preserve, just as it preserves the geometric
and size relationships you set.Many constraint-based modelers provide a number of options for quickly
placing holes, often through a “hole wizard” or other dialog box. Properties
that can often be set for holes are listed in Table 5.4.

A fillet is a common built-in feature that rounds the edge formed by two
surfaces. Typically, a fillet can be created by selecting the edges to befilleted (several can be selected at once) and specifying the radius of the
fillet. A round is another type of standard feature created in the same way,
usually using the same Fillet command. When the surfaces move or are
lengthened, the fillet or round adjusts automatically. Figure 5.64 shows a
typical fillet and a typical round with a uniform radius.
5.64 Fillet and Rounds
Sophisticated constraint-based modelers allow you to create uniform radius
fillets and rounds, chained fillets and rounds that blend around a corner of a
surface, constant-chord fillets and rounds, and variable-radius fillets and
rounds (shown in Figure 5.65) using different methods. A constant-chord
fillet is used in situations similar to Figure 5.65b, where a constant-radius
fillet would result in thicker material on the uphill and downhill side of the
blend. The constant-chord distance creates a fillet with a uniform amount of
added material. More sophisticated blends between surfaces are also
available in some software.5.65 Options for Fillets and Rounds
C0, C1, and C2 are terms used to describe the geometric continuity of
surface blends (see Figure 5.66). (You may also see the letter G used as a
designation for geometric continuity.)5.66 Surface Continuity. The iPhones above left were modeled with tangent surfaces: C1 continuity.
The smoother blends of the models on the right use C2 continuity. (Images courtesy of ©2016 Dassault
Systèmes SolidWorks Corporation.)
C0: Coincident surfaces meet but are not tangent. These are essentially
intersecting surfaces, not ones that have a fillet.
C1: Tangent surfaces meet and are tangent. This is the typical tangency
produced by Fillet commands, and is suitable for most rounded edges.
C2: Curvature continuous surfaces meet and are tangent, and where
surfaces blend, they share a common center of curvature. Surface blends
with this continuity do not have any abrupt change in radius. These
blends are important for styling of surfaces such as automobile hoods
and exterior plastic parts.
C3: The next level above C2, except that the rate of change for the
curvature is also continuous.
Complex Shapes
Complex shapes can often be made using special surface modeling
commands that create surfaces that cannot easily be made with regular
extrusion, revolution, sweeping, and blending. These surfaces can then be
added to the model (see Figure 5.67). Once a surface has been added to the
model and the edges completely matched (rather like being watertight), the
object then can be “solidified” into a solid, which allows mass property
calculations.5.67 The open-surface model in (a) is patched and then “solidified” into a solid model (b). (Courtesy
of Strategix Vision.)
Because the complex surface can slow down model regeneration, an
approximation of the surface may be used as a placeholder until later in the
refinement process.
5.10 Constraint-Based Modeling Modes
Most constraint-based modelers have three main modes that link together to
provide a full range of functionality in creating and documenting your
designs: part mode, which allows you to create individually manufactured
parts of a single material; assembly mode, which allows you to link
multiple parts together into assemblies (Figure 5.68) or subassemblies; and
drawing mode, which allows you to create orthographic, section, and
pictorial drawings to document the design.5.68 An Assembly Model of a Dynamometer (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)
5.69 A Drawing of the Dynamometer Assembly (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)
AssembliesAssembly capabilities in constraint-based modelers make concurrent
engineering feasible. Companies can use the single design database as the
hub of a collaborative environment for a cross-functional design team.
Planning the critical relationships that capture the design intent of the
assembly—just as would be done for each individual part—allows the
constraint-based assembly to be used to coordinate efforts of several
different individuals. The entire assembly and each part are stored in the
design database for members of the design and manufacturing team to view,
measure, or change (if authorized) while the parts are being designed.
The assembly provides a framework for the model. In the assembly, global
parameters can be used to build intelligent assemblies. For example, if
several parts assemble onto a shaft, the shaft diameter may be made a
global parameter. The hole sizes on the parts that fit onto the shaft may be
created by adding or subtracting a value from the global parameter for the
shaft diameter. If the shaft diameter is changed, all the parts that fit with it
may automatically be updated. Using global parameters can be an effective
way to coordinate the design effort for a team. You will learn more about
using assemblies to refine your design in Chapter 10.5.70 The parts that make up the iBike Pro cycling computer were modeled individually as solids,
then combined into a single assembly model to represent the finished product. The exploded view in
(a) shows the individual parts clearly; the assembled view in (b) shows how the parts will fit together.

Drawings from the Model
An advantage of solid modeling software is that drawings can be generated
from the solid model. Creating drawings using constraint-based modeling
software adds a significant dimension to this advantage: associativity.
Bidirectional Associativity
When a set of drawing views have been created from the model (Figure
5.71) and a change is made to the model, the drawing views will
automatically be updated because they are associated with the actual model.
Dimensions in most constraint-based modeling software control the sizes of
the model features. The process of dimensioning a drawing can beautomated because the software reports the dimension value for the entities
in the CAD database.
5.71 Associativity. The 1.50 dimension for the slot highlighted in green in the top view is changed
in the drawing to the new size, 2.00. (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)
If the size of a feature changes in the model, the value for the dimension in
the drawing is automatically updated to show the correct values. When this
is a one-way process—when changing the model causes the dimension
value to be updated on the drawing—the dimensions are said to be
associative. When this is a one-way process, changing the dimension valueon the drawing has no effect on the model geometry. In fact, it may break
the link between the dimension value and the model geometry.
Most constraint-based modelers are bidirectionally associative: changing a
dimension in the drawing changes the model geometry, and vice versa (see
Figures 5.71 and 5.72). Constraint-based modelers store and use the
dimensions and constraints to generate the model. When dimensions are
shown in a drawing, the values are the dimensions used to create the model.
Whether these dimensions are changed in the part or on the drawing, the
new values are stored in the database, and the model and all associated
drawings are updated to reflect the new dimension values. Bidirectional
associativity allows drawing changes to update the model, and model
changes to update the drawings.

and after the dimension on the drawing was changed to 2.00. (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)
Industry CaseConstraint-Based Modeling: Capturing Design Intent
When William Townsend was a Ph.D. student at MIT, he designed a four￾axis robot arm that simulates the motion of the human arm. This human￾scale dexterous arm works with the subsequently developed Barrett wrist
and robot hand produced and manufactured by Townsend’s engineering
firm, Barrett Technology. To prepare the design for larger-scale production,
the original 2D drawings were converted to constraint-based solid models,
which enhanced Barrett Technology’s ability to quickly make design
changes and evaluate the results. By redesigning the robot arm, the
company was able to make it the lightest one on the market and save 50%
over previous manufacturing costs.
To benefit from constraint-based modeling, it was important to design the
parts with the design goals in mind. “You need to keep your design intent in
mind. Even though the software is a powerful tool, if you tie up a feature or
overconstrain it, you are limiting the amount of flexibility you have in
changing it easily later,” said Brandon Larocque, project manager at Barrett
Technology.
The top plate of the BarrettHand is a good example of how Larocque
approaches constraint-based design (see Figure 5.73). The part has a total of
fourteen features and took about 30 minutes to model in SolidWorks. When
a new part is created, SolidWorks provides a default set of three orthogonal
planes that intersect at the origin. The user can add more planes, butSolidWorks allows any surface to be used as a sketch plane. Larocque
estimates that 80% to 90% of the parts he models do not need additional
sketch planes.
images
5.73 This rendered view of the BarrettHand clearly shows the top plate in relation to the rest of the
hand.
The top plate of the hand began as half of a symmetrical sketch that was
mirrored across the centerline (see Figure 5.74). The constraint-based
relations in the mirrored half of the part were set up so they would be the
same as those in the original half. To create the sketch, three radii were
dimensioned to form the curved end of the plate: one in each corner and a
larger one to form the curved end of the plate. The center of the largest
radius is constrained to always lie on a horizontal construction line inserted
into the base sketch. The other end-radii have tangency relationships where
they meet the large radius and the straight lines that define the other edges
of the plate. These tangency constraints were automatically created by
SolidWorks when the radii were sketched in place. The three radii were
constrained to be mutually tangent so the tool path generated by the model
would be a single smooth curve through the three radii. The only other
dimensions needed to define the part were those for the overall length of the
part and the rectangular shape at the top of the part. All distances
(dimensional constraints) were defined from the center of the part (whichalso coincided with the origin in SolidWorks). The sketch was then
extruded to become the base feature for the part.
5.74 The sketch for the base feature is symmetrical about the centerline. Dimensions are in SI units
with inch units in brackets.
When Larocque thinks about selecting a base feature, he chooses one that
will support additional features and reflect the way the part may be
modified and eventually built. “I think modeling in 3D is similar to the way
a machinist shapes a part. The modeling operations give you some intuition
about the steps required to make the part and how many different setups a
part will require. If you can make all of your features from the same surface
of a part, chances are the machinist will be able to make them from a single
setup as well. If you can form a part with a single revolution, you can
probably make the part on a lathe in a single setup. Each time you add asketching plane that is not normal or parallel to the default planes, you can
assume the part may require an additional setup in order to machine it.
Reducing a part’s design from four setups to three can reduce the machining
costs by 25%.” In the case of the top plate, all its features except the bevel
and the counterbores were created from the same side of the part.
Because the plate is symmetrical, its center point also served as the design
center of the part. The plate is designed to mate with two bearings set a
specified distance apart. Dimensioning the part about a point at the
intersection of the mirror line of the plate and a line through the center
points of the two bearing bores means that any change in the distance
between the bearings requires few changes to update the part.
The next step was to create the bevel around the outside of the base feature.
Using the mirror plane (across which the first sketch was mirrored) as the
sketching plane, Larocque sketched a triangular shape with a 30° angle (see
Figure 5.75). This sketch was the profile for the bevel. A contour was
sketched on the back surface of the plate to serve as the path for the
triangular profile. After selecting both sketches, he used a sweeping
operation to create the feature. SolidWorks prompted him to identify the
profile (the triangle), the path (the contour sketch), and the sweep operation
(a cut). The profile was dragged normal to the sweep path to cut the bevel
on the plate. A machinist cutting this feature into actual metal would
similarly use a 30° tapered mill to sweep out the same path defined in the
model.images
5.75 The triangular shape of the bevel is a sketch on the mirror plane that was swept along the
contour.
The next feature hollowed out the part. Sketching on the surface of the part
that lies on the original sketch plane, Larocque created half of the shape of
the area to be removed, dimensioned it from the centerline, and mirrored it
to create the complete outline. The sketch was then extruded to the
appropriate depth to be cut from the base feature (see Figure 5.76).
images
5.76 The sketch for hollowing out the plate included two distinct outlines that were extruded as a
single feature.
The fourth feature was a semicircular cutout to provide clearance for a
motor pinion (see Figure 5.77). This circle was sketched on the original
sketching plane, its diameter was dimensioned, and its center point was
constrained to the center of the part (which corresponds to the distance from
the centers of the bearings). Using a constraint to position the feature on the
part’s centerline guaranteed that the feature would stay centered even if the
overall size of the part changed. To form the feature, Larocque specified a
blind extrusion to a specified depth.
images
5.77 The sketch for the motor pinion cutout was constrained to the center of the part.With the part hollowed out, the new interior surface was used as the sketch
plane for the bosses that would be the bearing bores (see Figure 5.78). The
bosses could have been formed on the initial sketching plane in the same
operation that hollowed out the part, but their height would have been
constrained by the depth of the part. If the depth were to change, the height
of the bosses would, too. Using the new surface ensured that the relation of
the bosses to the inside surface of the plate would remain constant, even if
the depth of the surface changed.
images
5.78 The sketch for the bosses was drawn on the new surface created by the hollowing operation.
To create the bosses, Larocque created symmetrical 20-millimeter circles
with center points constrained to the horizontal centerline of the part. The
circles were extruded, and two new concentric circles were sketched on the
tops of the new features (see Figure 5.79). From the tops of the bosses,
Larocque extruded cuts back toward the bottom. Because the boss is to
serve as a bearing bore, the depth of the hole in the middle must correspond
to the width of the bearing, not the height of the boss. Extruding the hole
from the top of the boss means that the hole will remain at the same depth
even if the boss becomes taller or shorter. The same process was repeated to
make the two smaller bosses.
images
5.79 The bearing bores were sketched on top of the bosses.The next feature was a chamfer on the inside edges of the bearing bores.
SolidWorks allowed Larocque to multiselect all the bosses at once, then
insert a chamfer (see Figure 5.80). A chamfer is a built-in feature with its
own dialog box for setting its angle and depth. The single operation created
the four chamfers, all to the same specifications. They constitute a single
feature that cannot be decoupled into individual chamfers. Independent
control of each chamfer would require creating four separate features.
5.80 All four chamfers were added at once.
Another built-in feature, a fillet, was added next. Larocque selected the two
corners where the rectangular protrusion intersected the body of the part
and added both fillets with the same operation.
The H-shaped pocket at the top of the plate was sketched next as a
symmetrical feature. This feature is an alignment pocket that should move
with the bearing bores. Its location and radii were dimensioned from thecenter of the part (to coincide with the centers of the two 20-mm bosses),
and its length constrained to the centerline of the part (see Figure 5.81).
“Most of the features after the base feature are dimensioned from the
bearing bores because they are the defining characteristic of the part. I set
up a relationship between the bearing bores and the alignment pocket
because the alignment pocket determines where the bearings will fall.”
images
5.81 The alignment pocket sketch was dimensioned from the center of the part.
The final features were the six holes and the counterbores to accommodate
the fasteners to go into them. The first hole was given a diameter
dimension, then the other holes were constrained to be the same size as the
first (see Figure 5.82). All six were sketched on the sketch plane used for
the bevel contour and extruded with the “through all” setting so they will
always go all the way through the part, even if the part thickness changes.
From the same side of the part, the counterbores were added to the holes as
the final features. Larocque specified counterbores at the appropriate depth
that are concentric with the hole (see Figure 5.83).5.82 Only one of the holes displays a dimension here; the other five are constrained to the same
diameter as the first.
5.83 The counterbores were the last features added.
When asked about the degree to which he uses constraint-based relations,
Larocque explained, “We like to keep the model somewhat segmented sowe have more control over the updates, but we make sure to add relations
where they make sense. For example, constraining symmetrical parts to a
centerline as we did with the top plate of the hand can save enormous
amounts of time when the part can update automatically. This aspect of the
model was instrumental in our ability to make the BarrettHand lighter and
less costly to manufacture.”

Key considerations are the time required to model the part and the purposes
for which it will be used. A simpler method that provides all the needed
information is more cost-effective than one that takes longer to model.
However, time invested in a complete digital model of the product can pay
for itself if it is used to generate visuals that help shape the design, reduce
manufacturing difficulties, foster concurrent engineering—or promote the
product later.
The accuracy of the modeling method is another key consideration. What
types of analysis must be or could be completed with a model? What levelof accuracy will be required to interface with CAM programs?
As you have seen, 3D modeling packages that are strong in surface
modeling are needed to model the geometry of smoothly contoured features
such as the ergonomic mouse shown earlier in the chapter. Piping systems
and other structures of simple geometric shapes can sometimes be modeled
very effectively using 3D wireframe modeling. Many inexpensive CAD
packages support this type of modeling. However, a solid modeling package
is required to create a model that can be used to check parts for fit and
interference; calculate the weight of a final assembly from the many
individual parts; generate a rendered view of the assembly that can be used
in manufacturing, marketing, service and repair; and drive the computer￾aided machinery to manufacture parts. The same assembly model created
using constraint-based modeling methods would have the added advantage
of being updated automatically when key dimensions change. It would also
make it easy to create a family of similar parts.
Whether you choose the modeling package or learn to use the tools
provided by your employer, you should be aware of the strengths and
limitations of the software so you can use it most effectively.

Industry Case
Choosing the Right Method: Surface ModelingThe Stryker SmartPump tourniquet system continuously monitors and
controls tourniquet pressure during surgeries (Figure 5.84). When Kent
Swendseid, Design Director at Strategix Vision, designed the enclosure for
the product, he used surface modeling techniques to obtain the smooth
curves envisioned for the case and built-in handle.
images
5.84 A Concept Sketch for the “Smart Tourniquet”
Before these outside surfaces were modeled, the internal components and
user interface were worked out to determine the shape and volume required.
Concept sketches were done (including rough models in 3D) to show
various options for the enclosure. Once a concept was chosen and the
internal configuration was known, surface modeling started in earnest.
Swendseid used a modeling approach that works well for complex molded
assemblies: a “base part” controlling the overall shape and dimensions of
the assembly is modeled first, then the component parts are derived from
the base part. This way, if something in the design has to change, only the
base part has to be modified to alter the exterior. The derived parts are
updated accordingly. This approach also allows various parts to be modeled
in parallel by a team rather than a single designer.
The case concept was a clamshell of two large molded parts with a molded￾in handle. The first step was to identify key features, such as where andhow the two molded parts would come together, and where mounting
positions for things like the display would be. These were represented as
planes in the model. Shapes and contours important to the shape were also
created early in the modeling and are visible in the feature tree for the part
(see Figure 5.85). These changed as modeling progressed, but because the
model was built around them, it was simple to update.
images
5.85 The feature tree for the base part consists of planes and reference lines that other features are
derived from and constrained to.
The front face was modeled as a loft—a surface that morphs from one curve
to another. The curvature was controlled by either guide curves or tangency
constraints at the ends (Figure 5.86). Early surfaces are almost always
modeled larger than the face that will end up on the part to simplify
manipulation of the curvature—and to avoid unwanted edge effects.
images
5.86 The front surface lofts between guide curves.
The next surfaces added do not show up in the final model directly. These
“helper surfaces” can be used to control the angle where two surfaces meet
(Figure 5.87). To ensure that the surfaces of the mold will let go of the part
when it is ejected, the surface has to have what’s known as “draft”—the
surface has to sit at an angle to the direction the mold opens. Creating asimple helper surface at the parting plane provides a draft constraint to
which to tie a more complex surface: if the surface is tangent to a surface
with enough draft, it will have enough draft too. Helper surfaces are
trimmed off, deleted, or hidden when no longer needed.
images
5.87 Helper surfaces help position the surfaces and are trimmed off when no longer needed.
Additional faces were built using swept, extruded, and revolved surfaces to
define half of the symmetrical shape of the case. Using the symmetry does
more than save work; it also guarantees that the model will actually be
symmetrical. For a surface model, it also ensures that there will be no
visible artifact where the two parts join. This avoids distracting highlights
and waviness in the finished part.
In Figure 5.88, you can see that the part surfaces were modeled to extend
beyond their intersections with other surfaces, thus allowing the software to
calculate the intersections mathematically to create the edges between
surfaces. It also means that simpler profiles can be used to loft or sweep the
surfaces. The mathematics of surface modeling favors using the fewest
possible constraints, because more constraints require higher-order
polynomials to describe the surface. If the spline defining the intersection
were used to generate the surface, tiny perturbations in the driving
geometry could result in ripples or other undesired effects in the surface.5.88 Half the case is modeled to take advantage of the symmetry of the part.Trimming forms the boundary between surfaces. This operation can be used
to create hard edges, but in this case the shape required a rounded edge.
This requirement could be met with a fillet, but the designer wanted to
avoid the sudden change of curvature where the fillet meets the two
surfaces it joins. This is a common desire in product modeling, especially
with glossy surfaces that reveal the change of curvature as an unwanted
highlight instead of a smooth 3D curve. The designer also wanted to
“bulge” the rounded edge toward the top and bottom, which would have
required a variable-radius fillet—at the time, an unreliable feature.
To create the rounded edge, the front and side surfaces were trimmed to
helper surfaces that described the boundary (Figure 5.89, left) and the gap
was filled with another loft, which allowed the result to be curvature￾continuous. Note that the top and bottom of the two surfaces in Figure 5.89
(middle) still extend beyond where they will eventually end, again to
minimize the number of constraints on the fill surface.5.89 Trimming and Lofting a Surface to Create the Corner
The order in which operations are done affects modeling efficiency.
Sometimes it makes sense to leave trimming and joining surfaces to the
very end, and sometimes it makes sense to join them earlier to simplify
selecting them for other operations.
For example, the device mounts by fitting around a vertical pole behind it,
so the case needed an indentation to clear the pole. Because the pole
clearance surface crossed several others, modeling this feature was delayed
until the rest of the device had taken shape (see Figure 5.90).
5.90 Adding the Clearance Surface for the Mounting Pole
When it came time to add the handle opening, ergonomic concerns and
balance issues made it difficult to use the main parting plane of the base
part. The handle does not symmetrically straddle the main parting plane, sowhere the two halves of the clamshell would come together would be very
close to the front edge of the handle. Because this would make it
uncomfortable to hold the unit, the boundary of the part inside the handle
was shifted rearward toward the middle of the handle. The handle opening
was given its own parting plane.
The front opening for the handle area was then modeled in one feature
(Figure 5.91). The face at the front of the handle was deleted to open up the
edges, and those edges were captured as a compound curved profile. The
inner opening was sketched on the handle parting line plane, and a surface
was lofted between the two curves. The rear opening was handled similarly,
as were the transition surfaces from the front of the case to the opening for
the screen.
images
5.91 Modeling the Surface for the Front Half of the Handle Opening
Once the surface half is complete, it can be “closed.” This turns the surface
model into a solid model. Actually, a solid model is a surface model, just an
“airtight” one with no open edges.
With a symmetrical model, the easiest way to close the model is to knit
(join at the edges) a planar surface at the symmetry plane to the open edges
of the model (see Figure 5.92, middle). Some modelers then automaticallyassume the model is a solid, but some have to be told to check for edge gaps
and missing faces before changing the status of the body.
images
5.92 Closing the Model and Mirroring the Solid Part
Once the model is solidified, it can be mirrored, nonsymmetrical features
can be added, and the surface can be used in later design stages (see Figure
5.93). In some cases, it can make sense to mirror the surfaces themselves,
but that can increase the likelihood of small mathematical errors owing to
the more complex nature of the boundary.
images
5.93 Nonsymmetrical Detail Added to Back
Building a model from a base part allows detail work to be started even
before modeling of the base part is complete. As long as the surface can be
closed and a solid formed, that solid can be shelled and split up into
components. As additional features are added they are derived from the
base part geometry so they will be updated if the base part changes. Figure
5.94 shows this kind of detailing in the rear half of the assembly.

curved path. The resulting solid model allowed Brown to check the fit of the wire clamp. (Courtesy of

Chapter Summary
Now that you have completed this chapter you should be able to list the
qualities that models have that make them useful in the design process. You
should be able to describe four CAD modeling methods that you might use
to refine your design ideas. Not all modeling methods capture the same
amount of information about the parts or device. You should be able toselect the best modeling method to use for a particular design problem. The
exercises allow you to test your understanding of the modeling process, ask
you to apply a particular CAD modeling process to a design problem,
provide practice with your modeling package, and ask you to decide which
modeler you would choose to design a particular object.
You should be able to list advantages of constraint-based modeling over
solid modeling. You should be able to correctly use the term parent-child
relationships as applied to part features. Associativity between drawing
views and the 3D model is an key characteristic of sophisticated constraint￾based modeling programs. Selecting the base feature of the model is
important, as it is the first parent feature. The exercises ask you to
demonstrate your understanding of parent-child relationships and base
features by capturing design intent in a number of part models. They also
provide additional practice with your constraint-based modeling package.

ANSI/ASME Y14.3 Orthographic and Pictorial ViewsFront, Top, and Right-Side Views Generated from a 3D CAD Model (Courtesy of Big Sky Laser.)
Overview
A view of an object is called a projection. By projecting multiple views
from different directions in a systematic way, you can completely describe
the shape of 3D objects.
There are certain standard practices that you must know to create sketches
and documentation drawings that can be easily interpreted. For example,
you need to know which views to show, how they should be oriented inyour drawing, and how to represent key information such as edges,
surfaces, vertices, hidden lines, centerlines, and other crucial details.
The standard published in ANSI/ASME Y14.3 is common in the United
States, where third-angle projection is used. Europe, Asia, and many other
places use the first-angle projection system.
Understanding Projection
To make and interpret drawings, you need to understand projection and the
standard arrangement of views. You also need to be familiar with the
geometry of solid objects and be able to visualize a 3D object that is
represented in a 2D sketch or drawing. The ability to identify whether
surfaces are normal, inclined, or oblique in orientation can help you
visualize. Common features such as vertices, edges, contours, fillets, holes,
and rounds are shown in a standard way, which makes drawings simpler to
create and helps prevent them from being misinterpreted.
Views of Objects
A photograph shows an object as it appears to the observer but not
necessarily as it is. It cannot describe the object accurately, no matter what
distance or which direction it is taken from, because it does not show the
exact shapes and sizes of the parts. It would be impossible to create an
accurate 3D model of an object using only a photograph for reference
because it shows only one view. It is a 2D representation of a 3D object.Drawings are 2D representations as well, but unlike photos, they allow you
to record sizes and shapes precisely. In engineering and other fields, a
complete and clear description of the shape and size of an object is
necessary to be sure that it is manufactured exactly as the designer intended.
To provide this information about a 3D object, typically a number of
systematically arranged views are used.
The system of views is called multiview projection. Each view provides
certain definite information. For example, a front view shows the true shape
and size of surfaces that are parallel to the front of the object. An example
of a 3D object and its front view projection is shown in Figure 6.1. Figure
6.2 shows the same part and the six principal viewing directions. Figure 6.3
shows the same six views of a house.
6.1 Front View of an Object6.2 The Six Principal Views
6.3 Six Views of a House
The Six Standard ViewsAny object can be viewed from six mutually perpendicular directions, as
shown in Figure 6.2. These are called the six principal views.
You can think of the six views as what an observer would see by moving
around the object. As shown in Figure 6.3, the observer can walk around a
house and view its front, sides, and rear. You can imagine the top view as
seen by an observer from an airplane and the bottom, or worm’s-eye view,
as seen from underneath. The term plan may also be used for the top view.
The term elevation is used for all views showing the height of the building.
These terms are regularly used in architectural drawing and occasionally in
other fields.
To make drawings easier to read, the views are arranged on the paper in a
standard way. The views in Figure 6.3 show the American National
Standard arrangement. The top, front, and bottom views align vertically.
The rear, left-side, front, and right-side views align horizontally. To draw a
view out of place is a serious error and is generally regarded as one of the
worst mistakes in drawing. See Figure 6.4 for an illustration of how to
visualize the different views.6.4 Revolving the Object to Produce Views. You can experience different views by revolving an
object, as shown. (a) First, hold the object in the front view position. (b) To get the top view, tilt the
object toward you to bring the top of the object into your view. (c) To get the right-side view, begin
with the object’s front view facing you and revolve it to bring the right side toward you. To see views
of the rear, bottom, or left side, you would simply turn the object to bring those sides toward you.
Principal Dimensions
The three principal dimensions of an object are width, height, and depth
(Figure 6.5). In technical drawing, these fixed terms are used for
dimensions shown in certain views, regardless of the shape of the object.
The terms length and thickness are not used because they may be
misleading.6.5 The Principal Dimensions of an Object
The front view shows only the height and width of the object and not the
depth. In fact, any principal view of a 3D object shows only two of the three
principal dimensions; the third is found in an adjacent view. Height is
shown in the rear, left-side, front, and right-side views. Width is shown in
the rear, top, front, and bottom views. Depth is shown in the left-side, top,
right-side, and bottom views.
Projection Method
Figure 6.6 illustrates the front view of an object drawn using an
orthographic projection. Imagine a sheet of glass parallel to the front
surfaces of the object. This represents the plane of projection. The outline
on the plane of projection shows how the object appears to the observer. In
orthographic projection, rays (or projectors) from all points on the edges orcontours of the object extend parallel to each other and perpendicular to the
plane of projection. The word orthographic means “at right angles.”
6.6 Projection of an Object
Examples of top and side views are shown in Figure 6.7. Specific names are
given to the planes of projection. The front view is projected to the frontal
plane. The top view is projected to the horizontal plane. The side view is
projected to the profile plane.6.7 Horizontal and Profile Projection Planes
The Glass Box
One way to understand the standard arrangement of views on the sheet of
paper is to envision a glass box. If planes of projection were placed parallel
to each principal face of the object, they would form a box, as shown in
Figure 6.8. The outside observer would see six standard views (front, rear,
top, bottom, right side, left side) of the object through the sides of this
imaginary glass box.6.8 The Glass Box
To organize the views of a 3D object on a flat sheet of paper, imagine the
six planes of the glass box being unfolded to lie flat, as shown in Figure 6.9.
Think of all planes except the rear plane as hinged to the frontal plane. The
rear plane is usually hinged to the left-side plane. Each plane folds out away
from the frontal plane. The representation of the hinge lines of the glass box
in a drawing are known as folding lines. The positions of these six planes
after they have been unfolded are shown in Figure 6.10.6.9 Unfolding the Glass Box6.10 The Glass Box Unfolded
Carefully identify each of these planes and corresponding views with the
planes’ original position in the glass box.
In Figure 6.10, lines extend around the glass box from one view to another
on the planes of projection. These are the projectors from a point in one
view to the same point in another view. The size and position of the object
in the glass box does not change. This explains why the top view is the
same width as the front view and why it is placed directly above the front
view. The same relation exists between the front and bottom views.
Therefore, the front, top, and bottom views all line up vertically and are the
same width. The rear, left-side, front, and right-side views all line up
horizontally and are the same height.
Objects do not change position in the box, so the top view must be the same
distance from the folding line O/Z as the right-side view is from the folding
line O/Y. The bottom and left-side views are the same distance from their
respective folding lines as are the right-side and the top views. The top,
right-side, bottom, and left-side views are all the same distance from the
respective folding lines and show the same depth.
The front, top, and right-side views of the object shown in the previous
figures are shown in Figure 6.11a, but instead of a glass box, folding linesare shown between the views. These folding lines correspond to the hinge
lines of the glass box.
6.11 Views Shown with and without Folding Lines
The H/F folding line, between the top and front views, is the intersection of
the horizontal and frontal planes. The F/P folding line, between the front
and side views, is the intersection of the frontal and profile planes.
Although you should understand folding lines, particularly because they are
useful in solving problems in descriptive geometry, they are usually left off
the drawing, as in Figure 6.11b. Instead of using the folding lines as
reference lines for marking depth measurements in the top and side views,
you may use the front surface (A) of the object as a reference line. Note that
D1, D2, and all other depth measurements correspond in the two views as if
folding lines were used.
Spacing between ViewsSpacing between views is mainly a matter of appearance. Views should be
spaced well apart but close enough to appear related to each other. You may
need to leave space between the views to add dimensions.
Transferring Depth Dimensions
The depth dimensions in the top and side views must correspond point-for￾point. When using 2D CAD or instruments, transfer these distances
accurately.
You can transfer dimensions between the top and side views either with
dividers or with a scale, as shown in Figures 6.12a and 6.12b. Marking the
distances on a scrap of paper and using it like a scale to transfer the distance
to the other view is another method that works well when sketching.
6.12 Transferring Depth Dimensions
You may find it convenient to use a 45° miter line to project dimensions
between top and side views, as shown in Figure 6.12c. Because the miterline is drawn at 45°, depths shown vertically in the top view can be
transferred to be shown as horizontal depths in the side view and vice versa.
Measuring from a Reference Surface
To transfer a dimension from one view to a related view (a view that shares
that dimension), measure from a plane that shows on edge in both views as
in Figure 6.13.
6.13 Transferring Depth Dimensions from a Reference Surface
Necessary Views
Figure 6.14 shows that right- and left-side views are essentially mirror
images of each other, only with different lines appearing hidden. Hidden
lines use a dashed-line pattern to represent portions of the object that are notdirectly visible from that direction of sight. Both the right and left views do
not need to be shown, so usually the right-side view is drawn. This is also
true of the top and bottom views, and of the front and rear views. The top,
front, and right-side views, arranged together, are shown in Figure 6.15.
These are called the three regular views because they are the views most
frequently used.
6.14 Opposite Views Are Nearly Identical6.15 The Three Regular Views
A sketch or drawing should contain only the views needed to clearly and
completely describe the object. These minimally required views are referred
to as the necessary views. Choose the views that have the fewest hidden
lines and show essential contours or shapes most clearly. Complicated
objects may require more than three views or special views such as partial
views.
Many objects need only two views to clearly describe their shape. If an
object requires only two views, and the left-side and right-side views show
the object equally well, use the right-side view. If an object requires only
two views, and the top and bottom views show the object equally well,
choose the top view. If only two views are necessary and the top view and
right-side view show the object equally well, choose the combination that
fits best on your paper. Some examples are shown in Figure 6.16.6.16 Choice of Views to Fit Paper
Often, a single view supplemented by a note or by lettered symbols is
enough, as shown in Figure 6.17. Objects that can be shown using a single
view usually have a uniform thickness. This connecting rod is an exception.
It is possible to show it in a single view owing to the way it is dimensioned.
6.17 One-View Drawing of a Connecting Rod
Orientation of the Front View
Four views of a compact automobile are shown in Figure 6.18. The view
chosen for the front view in this case is the side, not the front, of the
automobile.6.18 Choice of Front View
The front view should show a large surface of the part parallel to the
front viewing plane.
The front view should show the shape of the object clearly.
The front view should show the object in a usual, stable, or operating
position, particularly for familiar objects.
When possible, a machine part is drawn in the orientation it occupies in
the assembly.
Usually, screws, bolts, shafts, tubes, and other elongated parts are drawn
in a horizontal position, as shown in Figure 6.19.6.19 A long part looks best oriented with the long axis horizontal on the sheet. (Courtesy of Dynojet
Research, Inc.)
CAD software can be used to generate orthographic views directly from a
3D model, as shown in Figure 6.20. The pictorial view of this model is
shown in Figure 6.21. When using CAD you still need to select a good
orientation so that the part shows clearly in the front view. The standard
arrangement of views shown in Figure 6.15 should be used. Do not be
tempted to rearrange the views of your CAD drawing to fit the sheet better,
unless you are using removed views.6.20 Computer-Generated Multiview Drawing from a CAD Model (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)6.21 Pictorial View of the CAD Model Shown in Figure 6.20 (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)First- and Third-Angle Projection
As you saw earlier in this chapter, you can imagine projecting views as
unfolding a glass box made from the viewing planes. There are two main
systems used for projecting and unfolding the views: third-angle
projection, which is used in the United States, Canada, and some other
countries, and first-angle projection, which is used primarily in Europe and
Asia. Difficulty in interpreting the drawing and manufacturing errors can
result when a first-angle drawing is confused with a third-angle drawing.
Because of the global nature of technical drawings, you should thoroughly
understand both methods. However, since it can be confusing to try to learn
both methods intermixed, this text presents third-angle projection
throughout. When you are comfortable with creating third-angle projection
drawings, revisit this section. You will see that the two drawing methods are
very similar, and you should be able to extend the same skills to either type
of drawing.
Third-Angle Projection
Figure 6.22a shows the concept of third-angle orthographic projection. To
avoid misunderstanding, international projection symbols have been
developed to distinguish between first-angle and third-angle projections on
drawings. The symbol in Figure 6.22b shows two views of a truncated cone.
You can examine the arrangement of the views in the symbol to determinewhether first- or third-angle projection was used. On international drawings
you should be sure to include this symbol.6.22 Third-Angle Projection
To understand the two systems, think of the vertical and horizontal planes
of projection, shown in Figure 6.22a, as indefinite in extent and intersecting
at 90° with each other; the four angles produced are called the first, second,
third, and fourth angles (similar to naming quadrants on a graph.) If the
object to be drawn is placed below the horizontal plane and behind the
vertical plane, as in the glass box you saw earlier, the object is said to be in
the third angle. In third-angle projection, the views are produced as if the
observer is outside, looking in.
Alternative Arrangements for Third-Angle Projection
Sometimes, drawing three views using the conventional arrangement wastes
space. (For example, see the wide, flat object in Figure 6.23a.) Using the
space on the paper efficiently may prevent the need to use a reduced scale.6.23 Position of Side View
For these cases, there is another acceptable arrangement of third-angle
projection views. Imagine unfolding the glass box as shown in Figure
6.23b. The views are arranged differently, with the right-side view aligned
with the top view. These views are still using third-angle projection.
In this case, the profile (side view) is hinged to the horizontal plane (top
view) instead of to the frontal plane (front view) so that the side view is
beside the top view when unfolded (Figure 6.23b). Notice that the side view
is rotated 90° from the orientation shown in the side view in Figure 6.23a in
this placement. Now you can directly project the depth dimension from the
top view into the side view.If necessary, you may place the side view horizontally across from the
bottom view (so the profile plane is hinged to the bottom plane of the
projection).
Similarly, the rear view may be placed directly above the top view or under
the bottom view. In this case, the rear plane is considered hinged to the
horizontal or bottom plane and rotated to coincide with the frontal plane.
First-Angle Projection
If the object is placed above the horizontal plane and in front of the vertical
plane, the object is in the first angle. In first-angle projection the observer
looks through the object to the planes of projection. The right-side view is
still obtained by looking toward the right side of the object, the front by
looking toward the front, and the top by looking down toward the top; but
the views are projected from the object onto a plane behind the object in
each case.
The biggest difference between third-angle projection and first-angle
projection is how the planes of the glass box are unfolded, as shown in
Figure 6.24. In first-angle projection, the right-side view is to the left of the
front view, and the top view is below the front view, as shown.6.24 First-Angle Projection. An object that is above the horizontal plane and in front of the vertical
plane is in the first angle. An observer looks through the object to the planes of projection.You should understand the difference between the two systems and know
the symbol that is placed on drawings to indicate which has been used.
Keep in mind that you will use third-angle projection throughout this book.
Projection System Drawing Symbol
The symbol shown in Figure 6.25 is used on drawings to indicate which
system of projection is used. Whenever drawings will be used
internationally, you should include this symbol in the title block area.
6.25 Drawing Symbols for First- and Third-Angle Projection
Hidden LinesOne advantage of orthographic views over photographs is that each view
can show the entire object from that viewing direction. A photograph shows
only the visible surface of an object, but an orthographic view shows the
object all the way through, as if it were transparent.
Thick, dark lines represent features of the object that are directly visible.
Dashed lines represent features that would be hidden behind other surfaces.
Figure 6.26 shows a part that has internal features. When a 3D view of this
model is rendered using a transparent material, as shown in Figure 6.27,
you can see the internal features. Figure 6.28 shows this part from the front
as it would be oriented in an orthographic drawing. The features that are
hidden from view are shown in orthographic views using the hidden line
pattern as shown in Figure 6.29.
6.26 Shaded Model with Hidden Features6.27 Transparent Model Showing Hidden Features
6.28 Front View of Transparent Model
6.29 Front View ProjectionWhenever possible, choose views that show features with visible lines. Use
hidden lines where they are needed to make the drawing clear.
Some practices for representing intersections of hidden lines with other
lines may be difficult to follow when using CAD. In CAD, adjust the line
patterns so that the hidden lines in your drawing have the best appearance
possible.
Centerlines
The centerline pattern is used to:
Show the axis of symmetry for a feature or part.
Indicate a path of motion.
Show the location for bolt-hole circles and other circular patterns.
The centerline pattern is composed of three dashes: one long dash on each
end with a short dash in the middle. In the drawing, centerlines are shown
thin and black. Because a centerline is not an actual part of the object, it
extends beyond the symmetrical feature as shown in Figure 6.30.6.30 Cylindrical Surfaces and Holes
The most common shape that needs a centerline is a cylindrical hole. Figure
6.30b shows centerlines in a drawing. In the circular view of a hole, the
centerline should form a cross to mark the center location. When a feature
is too small for the centerline pattern to be shown with the long-short-long
dash pattern, it is acceptable to use a straight line. You will learn more
about showing hidden lines and centerlines in the technique sections.6.31 Hidden Lines
6.1 Hidden Line Technique
You can save time and reduce clutter by leaving out hidden lines that aren’t
necessary as long as you are certain that the remaining lines describe the
object clearly and completely. If you omit unnecessary hidden lines, add a
note to let the reader know that the lines were left out intentionally and that
it is not an error in the drawing.
Sketch hidden lines by eye, using thin dark dashes about 5 mm long and
spaced about 1 mm apart. Hidden lines should be as dark as other lines in
the drawing, but should be thin.
When hidden lines intersect each other in the drawing, their dashes should
meet. In general, hidden lines should intersect neatly with visible lines at
the edge of an object. Leave a gap when a hidden line aligns with a visible
line, so that the visible line’s length remains clear.
6.2 Precedence of Lines
Visible lines, hidden lines, and centerlines often coincide on a drawing.
There are rules for deciding which line to show. A visible line always takes
precedence over and covers up a centerline or a hidden line when they
coincide in a view, as shown at A and B in Figure 6.32. A hidden line takes
precedence over a centerline, as shown at C. At A the ends of the centerlineare shown separated from the view by short gaps, but the centerline is
usually left off entirely. Figure 6.33 shows examples of correct and
incorrect hidden lines.
6.32 Precedence of Lines6.33 Correct and Incorrect Practices for Hidden Lines
TipWhen sketching, accent the beginning and end of each dash by pressing
down on the pencil. Make hidden lines as tidy as you can so they are easy
to interpret. Be sure to make hidden line dashes longer than gaps so they
clearly represent lines. Your CAD system may have limitations that make it
impractical to comply with these requirements. If so, strive for hidden lines
that are clear and easy to interpret.
6.3 Centerlines
Centerlines (symbol: ) are used to indicate symmetrical axes of objects or
features, bolt circles, and paths of motion as shown in Figure 6.34.
Centerlines are useful in dimensioning. They are not needed on unimportant
rounded or filleted corners or on other shapes that are self-locating.6.34 Centerlines
6.4 Laying Out a Drawing
If you use 2D CAD, you can move the views later, keeping them in
alignment, so you do not need to give as much attention to placement of the
views in the beginning as if you were laying them out by hand. When using
3D CAD to generate views, you should still plan how the sheet will show
the information clearly and select the necessary views to best represent the
shape of the part. Although you can easily change the scale of a CAD
drawing after it is created, placing the dimensions and views on the sheet
requires some planning. If you consider the purpose of the drawing, the
planned scale, and the space that will be required for adding notes and
dimensions, you will save the time of having to rearrange their placement
later.
Step by Step
Hand LayOut of a Metric Three-View DrawingDetermine space desired between the front and right-side views (C),
say 32 mm. Add this space to the sum of the length of the views that will be
aligned along the long edge of the sheet (108 + 58 + 32 = 198). To set
equal distances to the paper edge, subtract this total from the sheet width,
then divide the remaining number by two (280 − 198 = 82, and 
82 ÷ 2 = 41). Do the same for the views to be aligned along the short side
of the paper, selecting a desired space between the views. Space D need not
match C. Remember to leave space for dimensions as you plan your sheet.
Set off vertical and horizontal spacing measurements with light tick
marks along the edge of the sheet as shown. Locate centerlines from these
spacing marks, and construct arcs and circles.Construct the views, drawing horizontal, vertical, and then inclined
construction lines in the order shown above.Add hidden lines and darken final lines.
6.5 Developing views from 3D Models
For most 3D software, creating orthographic views from the model is
simple. Two basic steps are required: selecting a location on the page where
the orthographic view will be placed and selecting the viewing direction.
Adding more orthographic views is even easier, as they may be
automatically placed in relation to the initial view.
Even if your CAD package does not automate the creation of orthographic
drawing views to this extent, creating orthographic views directly from the
3D model still offers an advantage. Even people trained in orthographic
projection of views have difficulty visualizing complex orthographic viewscorrectly all the time—and the views can be time-consuming to create.
Using the 3D object to develop the views helps get the projection right.
When you are selecting which views to show, keep in mind the same
practices that make a good sketch:
Show the shape of the object clearly in the front view, which is placed in
a central location on the drawing sheet (see Figure 6.35).
6.35 Orthographic Views and Shaded Pictorial View Generated from the Part Model (Courtesy of
Dynojet Research, Inc.)For objects with uniform thickness, use a single view and specify the
thickness in a note (see Figure 6.36).
6.36 This object is fully defined with a single view and a note. (Courtesy of Implemax Equipment Co.,
Inc.)
For complicated parts, show at least two drawing views in the standard
arrangement to make it easy to interpret the views. The reader is not as
familiar with the shape of the part as you are. Place additional views on a
second drawing sheet if necessary; it is preferred to have all the views on
one sheet if they are clear. When multiple sheets are used, indicate this in
the title block with a note such as “Sheet 1 of 3.”
Make the drawing clear and easy to interpret. Use different line
thicknesses to make the object stand out clearly.
Show the object at a size so that its features are visible, or include an
enlarged detail view at a larger scale (see Figure 6.37).6.37 Drawing of an Injection-Molded Part with Sections and Enlarged Details (Courtesy of Dynojet
Research, Inc.)
Except for enlarged details, show all views at the same scale.
Clearly note the difference in scale for enlarged detail views.
Show only as many views as necessary. Do not add unnecessary views.
They confuse the reader. At times additional views are needed for clear
placement of dimensions. You can simplify views by leaving out hidden
lines that do not add to the interpretation of the view. If you leave out
lines, it is a good idea to label the view as a partial view.
Placing the Views
As you plan the views to be included, allow for plenty of white space on the
drawing. Leave room for dimensions between the views, and separate the
views from one another with white space. The space between drawingviews does not have to be equal, yet the views should appear to be related.
Do not space them too far apart. If there is not enough white space in your
drawing, or if the views are too small to see the details clearly, consider
using a larger sheet size (see Figure 6.38).
6.38 Spacing Drawing Views
Isometric Views
Including isometric views in detail drawings helps others easily interpret
the drawing. Isometric views are often shown in the upper right-hand area
of the drawing, as there is often room there. The isometric view does not
have to be at the same scale as the other views. Often, a smaller scale is just
as clear and fits on the sheet better. It is not necessary to indicate the scale
of the isometric view on the drawing. Figure 6.39 shows an example of an
isometric view added to a part drawing. Remember that hidden lines are not
usually shown in isometric views. Most modern CAD packages have preset
isometric viewing directions that you can select for the model.6.39 The isometric view provides an easy visual reference for the part described in the orthographic
views.
6.6 Visualization
Along with having an understanding of the system for projecting views, you
must be able interpret multiple views to picture the object that they show. In
addition to being an indispensable skill to help you capture and
communicate your ideas, technical sketching is also a way for others to
present their ideas to you.Even experienced engineers, technicians, and designers can’t always look at
a multiview sketch and instantly visualize the object represented. You will
learn to study the sketch and interpret the lines in a logical way to piece
together a clear idea of the whole. This process is sometimes called
visualization.
Surfaces, Edges, and Corners
To effectively create and interpret multiview projections, you have to
consider the elements that make up most solids. Surfaces form the
boundaries of solid objects. A plane (flat) surface may be bounded by
straight lines, curves, or a combination of the two.
Practice Visualizing
It takes practice to envision flat representations as 3D objects. Take a
moment to examine the views shown in Figure 6.40 and try to picture the
object. (See solution on page 258).6.40 Three Views of an Object
6.7 Views of Surfaces
A plane surface that is perpendicular to a plane of projection appears on
edge as a straight line (Figure 6.41a). If it is parallel to the plane of
projection, it appears true size (Figure 6.41b). If it is angled to the plane of
projection, it appears foreshortened or smaller than its actual size (Figure
6.41c). A plane surface always projects either on edge (appearing as a
single line) or as a surface (showing its characteristic shape) in any view. It
can appear foreshortened, but it can never appear larger than its true size in
any view.6.41 Projections of Surfaces
There are terms used for describing a surface’s orientation to the plane of
projection. The three orientations that a plane surface can have to the plane
of projection are normal, inclined, and oblique. Understanding these terms
will help you picture and describe objects.
Tip
Using Numbers to Identify Vertices
Add lightly drawn numbers to your sketches to keep track of each vertex
on the surface you are considering. Each vertex is unique on the part, so
each numbered vertex will appear only once in each view. Sometimes two
vertices will line up one behind the other, as in Figure 6.41a. When this
happens you can list them in order with the closest first, as in 1, 2, or
sometimes it is useful to put numbers for the closest visible vertex outside
the shape, and the farthest hidden vertex inside the shape outline.
6.8 Normal SurfacesA normal surface is parallel to a plane of projection. It appears true size
and true shape on the plane to which it is parallel, and it appears as a true￾length vertical or a horizontal line on adjacent planes of projection. Figure
6.42 shows an illustration of normal surfaces.
6.42 Normal Surfaces
6.9 Inclined Surfaces
An inclined surface is perpendicular to one plane of projection but inclined
(or tipped) to adjacent planes. An inclined surface projects on edge on the
plane to which it is perpendicular. It appears foreshortened on planes to
which it is inclined. An inclined surface is shown in Figure 6.43. The
degree of foreshortening is proportional to the inclination. Although the
surface may not appear true size in any view, it will have the same
characteristic shape and the same number of edges in the views in which
you see its shape.6.43 Inclined Surface
Tip
Practice identifying normal surfaces on CAD drawings. You can download
orthographic views of subjects that show many normal surfaces from
several websites.
6.10 Oblique Surfaces
An oblique surface is tipped to all principal planes of projection. Because it
is not perpendicular to any projection plane, it cannot appear on edge in any
standard view. Because it is not parallel to any projection plane, it cannot
appear true size in any standard view. An oblique surface always appears as
a foreshortened surface in all three standard views. Figures 6.44 and 6.45
show oblique surfaces.6.44 Oblique Surface
6.45 Adding an Oblique Surface to an Isometric Sketch
6.11 Edges
The intersection of two plane surfaces of an object produces an edge, which
shows as a straight line in the drawing. An edge is common to two surfaces,
forming a boundary for each. If an edge is perpendicular to a plane of
projection, it appears as a point; otherwise it appears as a line. If it is
parallel to the plane of projection, it shows true length. If it is not parallel, itappears foreshortened. A straight line always projects as a straight line or as
a point. The terms normal, inclined, and oblique describe the relationship of
an edge to a plane of projection.
6.12 Normal Edges
A normal edge is a line perpendicular to a plane of projection. It appears as
a point on that plane of projection and as a true-length line on adjacent
planes of projection (Figure 6.46).
6.46 Projections of a Normal Edge
6.13 Inclined Edges
An inclined edge is parallel to one plane of projection but inclined to
adjacent planes. It appears as a true-length line on the plane to which it is
parallel and as a foreshortened line on adjacent planes. The true-length viewof an inclined line always appears as an angled line, but the foreshortened
views appear as either vertical or horizontal lines (Figure 6.47).
6.47 Projections of an Inclined Edge
6.14 Oblique Edges
An oblique edge is tipped to all planes of projection. Because it is not
perpendicular to any projection plane, it cannot appear as a point in any
standard view. Because it is not parallel to any projection plane, it cannot
appear true length in any standard view. An oblique edge appears
foreshortened and as an angled line in every view (Figure 6.48).6.48 Projections of an Oblique Edge
6.15 Parallel Edges
When edges are parallel to one another on the object, they will appear as
parallel lines in every view, unless they align one behind the other. This
information can be useful when you are laying out a drawing, especially if
it has a complex inclined or oblique surface that has parallel edges. Figure
6.49 shows an example of parallel lines in drawing views.
6.49 Parallel Lines6.16 Angles
If an angle is in a normal plane (a plane parallel to a plane of projection), it
will show true size on the plane of projection to which it is parallel (Figure
6.50). If an angle is in an inclined plane, it may be projected either larger or
smaller than the true angle, depending on its position. The 45° angle is
shown oversize in the front view in Figure 6.50b, and the 60° angle is
shown undersize in both views in Figure 6.50c.
images
6.50 Angles
A 90° angle will project as true size, even if it is in an inclined plane,
provided that one leg of it is a normal line.
In Figure 6.50d, the 60° angle is projected oversize, and the 30° angle is
projected undersize. Try this on your own using a 30° or 60° triangle as a
model, or even the 90° corner of a sheet of paper. Tilt the triangle or paper
to look at an oblique view.
6.17 Vertices
A corner, or point, is the common intersection of three or more surfaces,
which is called a vertex on the part. A point appears as a point in every
view. An example of a point on an object is shown in Figure 6.51.images
6.51 Views of a Point
6.18 Interpreting Points
A point located in a sketch can represent two things:
A vertex
The point view of an edge (two vertices lined up one directly behind the
other)
6.19 Interpreting Lines
A straight visible or hidden line in a drawing or sketch has three possible
meanings, as shown in Figure 6.52:
images
6.52 Interpreting Lines
An edge (intersection) between two surfaces
The edge view of a surface
The limiting element of a curved surface
Because no shading is used on orthographic views, you must examine all
the views to determine the meaning of the lines. If you were to look at only
the front and top views in Figure 6.52, you might believe line AB is theedge view of a flat surface. From the right-side view, you can see that there
is a curved surface on top of the object.
If you look at only the front and side views, you might believe the vertical
line CD is the edge view of a plane surface. The top view reveals that the
line actually represents the intersection of an inclined surface.
6.20 Similar Shapes of Surfaces
If a flat surface is viewed from several different positions, each view will
show the same number of sides and a similar shape. This consistency of
shapes is useful in analyzing views. For example, the L-shaped surface
shown in Figure 6.53 appears L-shaped in every view in which it does not
appear as a line. A surface will have the same number of sides and vertices
and the same characteristic shape whenever it appears as a surface. Note
how the U-shaped, hexagonal, and T-shaped surfaces in Figure 6.54 are
recognizable in different views.

6.54 Similar Shapes
Practice VisualizingLook at the top view (a) and then examine some of the various objects it
could represent. As you practice interpreting views, you will get better at
visualizing 3D objects from projected views.
Notice that the top view alone does not provide all the information, but it
does tell you that surfaces A, B, and C are not in the same plane. There are
many possibilities beyond those shown.
6.21 Interpreting Views
One method of interpreting sketches is to reverse the mental process used in
projecting them. The views of an angle bracket are shown in Figure 6.55a.
images
6.55 Visualizing from Given Views
The front view (Figure 6.55b) shows the object’s L-shape, its height, and its
width. The meanings of the hidden lines and centerlines are not yet clear,
and you do not know the object’s depth.The top view (Figure 6.55c) shows the depth and width of the object. It also
makes it clear that the horizontal feature is rounded at the right end and has
a round hole. A hidden line at the left end indicates some kind of slot.
The right-side view (Figure 6.55d) shows the height and depth of the object.
It reveals that the left end of the object has rounded corners at the top and
clarifies that the hidden line in the front view represents an open-end slot in
a vertical position.
Each view provides certain definite information about the shape of the
object, and all are necessary to visualize it completely.
Step by Step
Reading a Drawing
images
Visualize the object shown by the three views at left. Because no lines
are curved, the object must be made up of plane surfaces.
The shaded surface in the top view is a six-sided L-shape. Because you do
not see its shape in the front view—and every surface appears either as its
shape or as a line—it must be showing on edge as a line in the front view.The indicated line in the front view also projects to line up with the vertices
of the L-shaped surface.
Because we see its shape in the top view and because it is an angled line in
the front view, it must be an inclined surface on the object. This means it
will show its foreshortened shape in the side view as well, appearing L￾shaped and six-sided. The L-shaped surface in the right-side view must be
the same surface that was shaded in the top view.
images
The front view shows the top portion as a triangular surface, but no
triangular shapes appear in either the top or the side view. The triangular
surface must appear as a line in the top view and in the side view.
Sketch projection lines from the vertices of the surface where you see its
shape. The same surface in the other views must line up along the
projection lines. In the side view, it must be the line indicated. That can help
you to identify it as the middle horizontal line in the top view.
imagesThe trapezoidal surface shaded in the front view is easy to identify,
but there are no trapezoids in the top and side views. Again, the surface
must be on edge in the adjacent views.
On your own, identify the remaining surfaces using the same
reasoning. Which surfaces are inclined, and which are normal? Are there
any oblique surfaces?
If you are still having trouble visualizing the object, try picturing the views
as describing those portions of a block that will be cut away, as illustrated
below.
images
6.22 Models
One of the best aids to visualization is an actual model of the object.
Models don’t necessarily need to be made accurately or to scale. They may
be made of any convenient material, such as modeling clay, soap, wood,
wire, or Styrofoam, or any material that can easily be shaped, carved, or
cut. Some examples of soap models are shown in Figure 6.56.

6.56 Soap ModelsRules for Visualizing from a Drawing: Putting It All Together
Reading a multiview drawing is like unraveling a puzzle. When you
interpret a drawing, keep these things in mind:
The closest surface to your view must have at least one edge showing as
a visible line.
A plane surface has a similar shape in any view or appears on edge as a
straight line.
Lines of the drawing represent either an intersection between two
surfaces, a surface perpendicular to your view that appears “on edge,” or
the limiting element of a curved surface.
No two adjacent areas divided by a visible line in an orthographic view
can be the same plane in the actual object. Areas not adjacent in a view
may lie in the same plane on the object.
If a line appears hidden, a closer surface is hiding it.
Your interpretation must account for all the lines of the drawing. Every
line has a meaning.
Tip
Making a Model
Try making a soap or clay model from projected views:
imagesFirst, look at the three views of the object. Make your block of clay to the
same principal dimensions (height, width, and depth) as shown in the
views.
images
images
Score lines on the frontal surface of your clay block to correspond with
those shown on the front view in the drawing. Then do the same for the top
and right-side views.
images
Slice straight along each line scored on the clay block to get a 3D model
that represents the projected views.
6.23 Projecting a Third View
Ordinarily, when you are designing a product or system, you have a good
mental picture of what it will look like from different directions. However,
skill in projecting a third view can be useful for two reasons. First, views
must be shown in alignment in the drawing and projected correctly. Second,practice in projecting a third view from two given views is an excellent way
to develop your visual abilities.
Numbering the vertices on the object makes projecting a third view easy.
Points that you number on the drawing represent points on the object where
three surfaces come together to form a vertex (and sometimes a point on a
contour or the center of a curve).
Once you have located a point in two drawing views, its location in the
third view is known. In other words, if a point is located in the front and top
view, its location in the side view is a matter of projecting the height of the
point in the glass box from the front view and the depth of the point in the
glass box from the top view.
To number the points or vertices on the object and show those numbers in
different views, you need to be able to identify surfaces on the object. Then,
project (or find) the points in each new view, surface by surface. You can
use what you know about edges and surfaces to identify surfaces on the
object when you draw views. This will help you interpret drawings created
by others as well as project your own drawings correctly.
Step by Step
Manually Projecting a Third ViewThe figure below is a pictorial drawing of an object to be shown in three
views. It has numbers identifying each corner (vertex) and letters
identifying some of the major surfaces. You are given the top and front
view. You will use point numbers to project the side view.
images
To number points effectively, first identify surfaces and interpret the
views that are given. Start by labeling visible surfaces whose shapes are
easy to identify in one view. Then, locate the same surface in the adjacent
view. (The surfaces on the pictorial object have been labeled to make it
easier.)
images
Surface A in the front view is a normal surface. It will appear as a
horizontal line in the top view. The two rectangular surfaces B and C in the
top view are a normal surface and an inclined surface. They will show as a
horizontal line and an inclined line in the front view, respectively.
imagesAfter identifying the surfaces, label the vertices of a surface that has
an easily recognized shape, in this case, surface A.
Label its vertices with numbers at each corner as shown. If a point is
directly visible in the view, place the number outside the corner.
If the point is not directly visible in that view, place the numeral inside the
corner. Using the same numbers to identify the same points in different
views will help you project known points in two views to unknown
positions in a third view.
images
Continue, surface by surface, until you have numbered all the vertices
in the given views as shown. Do not use two different numbers for the same
vertex.
imagesTry to visualize the right-side view you will create. Then, construct
the right-side view point by point, using very light lines. Locate point 1 in
the side view by drawing a light horizontal projection line from point 1 in
the front view. Use the edge view of surface A in the top view as a
reference plane to transfer the depth location for point 1 to the side view as
shown.images
imagesProject points 2, 3, and 4 in a similar way to complete the vertical
end surface of the object.
images
imagesProject the remaining points using the same method, proceeding
surface by surface.
images
imagesUse the points that you have projected into the side view to draw
the surfaces of the object as in this example.
If surface A extended between points 1-3-7-9-5 in the front view where you
can see its shape clearly, it will extend between those same points in every
other view.
images
When you connect these points in the side view, they form a vertical line.
This makes sense, because A is a normal surface. As is the rule with normal
surfaces, you will see its shape in one standard view (the front in this case)and it will appear as a horizontal or vertical line in the other views.
Continue connecting vertices to define the surfaces on the object, to
complete the third view.
imagesInspect your drawing to see if all the surfaces are shown, and
darken the final lines.
Consider the visibility of surfaces. Surfaces that are hidden behind other
surfaces should be shown with hidden lines.

an example of how a single orthographic view can be difficult to interpret. (Ship Arriving Too Late to Save

6.24 Becoming a 3D Visualizer
To the untrained person, orthographic projections might not convey the idea
of a 3D shape, but with some practice you should now be able to look at
projected front, top, and right-side views and envision that they represent
the width, depth, and height of an object. Understanding how points, lines,
and surfaces can be interpreted and how normal, inclined, or obliquesurfaces appear from different views helps you interpret orthographic views
to form a mental image of the object.
Understanding how orthographic views represent an object gives you the
power to start capturing your own concepts on paper in a way that others
can interpret. Keep in mind the idea of an unfolded “glass box” to explain
the arrangement of views. This clarifies how the views relate to one another
and why you can transfer certain dimensions from adjacent views. Using
standard practices to represent hidden lines and centerlines helps you
further define surfaces, features, and paths of motion.
The better you understand the foundation concepts of projected views, the
more fluent you will be in the language of 3D representation and the skill of
spatial thinking, regardless of whether you sketch by hand or use CAD.

Step by Step
Using A Miter Line
Given two completed views, you can use a miter line to transfer the depths
and draw the side view of the object shown at right.
images imagesLocate the miter line a convenient distance away from the object to
produce the desired spacing between views.
images
Sketch light lines projecting depth locations for points to the miter
line and then down into the side view as shown.
images
Project the remaining points.
images
Draw the view by locating each vertex of the surface on the projection
line and across the miter line.
To move the right-side view to the right or left, move the top view upward
or downward by moving the miter line closer to or farther from the view.
You don’t need to draw continuous lines between the top and side views via
the miter line. Instead, make short dashes across the miter line and project
from these. The 45° miter-line method is also convenient for transferring a
large number of points, as when plotting a curve.images

Chapter Summary
Orthographic drawings are the result of projecting the image of a 3D
object onto one of six standard planes of projection. The six standard
views are often thought of as an unfolded glass box. The arrangement of
the views in relation to one another is important. Views must line up
with adjacent views, so that any point in one view projects to line up
with that same point in the adjacent view. The standard arrangement of
views shows the top, front, and right side of the object.
Visualization is an important skill. You can build your visual abilities
through practice and through understanding terms describing objects.
For example, surfaces can be normal, inclined, or oblique. Normal
surfaces appear true size in one principal view and as an edge in the
other two principal views. Inclined surfaces appear as an edge in one ofthe three principal views. Oblique surfaces do not appear as an edge in
any of the principal views.
Choice of scale is important for representing objects clearly on the
drawing sheet.
Hidden lines are used to show the intersections of surfaces, surfaces that
appear on edge, and the limits of curved surfaces that are hidden from
the viewing direction.
Centerlines are used to show the axis of symmetry for features and paths
of motion, and to indicate the arrangement for circular patterns.
Creating CAD drawings involves applying the same concepts as in paper
drawing. The main difference is that drawing geometry is stored more
accurately using a computer than in any hand drawing. CAD drawing
geometry can be reused in many ways and plotted to any scale as
necessary.

ANSI/ASME Y14.3 Orthographic and Pictorial ViewsMany consumer products, such as the robotic vacuum cleaner pictured here, use durable affordable
plastic parts. The lifecycle of the product is something to keep in mind. Is there a path for reusing or
recycling the plastic used, or for upgrading the product, or will it end in a landfill?

Overview
An object with molded plastic parts like the one shown above has curved
surfaces on inside and outside corners to make it easier to remove the part
from the mold. There are a number of practices for showing curved surfaces
in your drawings.
Learning the names of typical features and hole types that are used in part
design and how they are represented in drawing views will make it easier
for you to communicate about designs and to understand their
documentation requirements.At times, conventional practices are used that are not standard orthographic
projections. This is to make it easier to represent or interpret objects in
drawings. An example is revolving certain features when it adds to the
clarity of the drawing. Another example is showing “breaks” when a part
does not fit well on the sheet because of its long shape, or to avoid
unnecessary detail.
There is an art to creating drawings that show the information clearly and
provide all the detail necessary to manufacture it. People can read drawings
most easily when views, dimensions, and lines are placed in logical
locations that aid in the reader’s comprehension of the part and the design
intent for the part.
Practices for 2D Documentation Drawings
Now that you are familiar with the basics of orthographic projection and
visualizing objects from the information presented in orthographic views,
you are ready to make and read more complex 2D drawings. Although you
might sketch complex designs by hand, it is more likely that you would
create these types of drawings using CAD, either as 2D CAD drawings, or
as 2D CAD drawings generated from a 3D solid model.
Sometimes, practices used to create drawings with 3D CAD differ from
those used to create hand-drawn or 2D CAD drawings. You mustunderstand the standards and practices for creating good drawings even
when using 3D CAD. The software will not do everything for you.
Common Manufactured Features
Certain features are a part of many engineering designs. Learning their
names and shapes, as shown in Figure 7.1 and detailed in Table 7.1, helps
you visualize and communicate about them. Some CAD systems may even
have prebuilt features that you can place onto a 3D part to create them
quickly.
7.1 Commonly Manufactured FeaturesTable 7.1 Common Manufactured Features
Feature Example
Fillet: A rounded interior blend between surfaces; used,
for example, to strengthen adjoining surfaces or to allow
a part to be removed from a mold
Round: A rounded exterior blend between surfaces; used
to make edges and corners easier to handle, improve
strength of castings, and allow for removal from a mold
Counterbore: A cylindrical recess around a hole, usually
to receive a bolt head or nut
Countersink: A cone-shaped recess around a hole, often
used to receive a tapered screw headFeature Example
Spotface: A shallow recess like a counterbore, used to
provide a good bearing surface for a fastener
Boss: A short raised protrusion above the surface of a
part, often used to provide a strong flat bearing surface
Lug: A flat or rounded tab protruding from a surface,
usually to provide a method for attachment
Flange: A flattened collar or rim around a cylindrical part
to allow for attachment
Chamfer: An angled surface, used on a cylinder to make
it easier to start into a hole, or a plate to make it easier to
handleFeature Example
Neck: A small groove cut around the diameter of a
cylinder, often where it changes diameter
Keyway/Keyseat: A shaped depression cut along the axis
of a cylinder or hub to receive a key, used to attach hubs,
gears, and other parts to a cylinder so they will not turn
on it
Knurl: A pattern on a surface to provide for better
gripping or more surface area for attachment, often used
on knobs and tool handles
Bushing: A hollow cylinder that is often used as a
protective sleeve or guide, or as a bearing
Conventional RepresentationsStandard orthographic projections don’t always show complex shapes as
clearly and simply as you may wish, so certain alternative practices,
referred to as conventions, are accepted. Although “convention” is usually a
general term for an accepted method, in the case of technical drawing it
refers particularly to a simplified representation that enhances economy and
clarity in a drawing. Although conventional representations do deviate from
true orthographic projection, their methods of simplification are generally
recognized and accepted. (See ASME Y14.3.) In other words, conventions
are like rules for breaking the rules.
Intersections and Tangencies
To represent complex objects, multiview drawings use standard methods for
depicting the way planar and curved surfaces meet. A plane surface can
intersect or be tangent to a contoured surface, as shown in Figures 7.2 and
7.3. When a plane surface intersects the contoured surface, a line is drawn
to represent the edge formed by that intersection. When the plane surface is
tangent to the contoured surface, no line or a thin phantom line pattern is
drawn where the surfaces meet, depending on whether the phantom line is
needed to aid in visualization.7.2 Intersecting and Tangent Surfaces
7.3 Orthographic Views of Intersecting and Tangent SurfacesRemoved Views
It is not always possible to show all the drawing views in alignment on the
sheet. This is particularly true of civil and architectural drawings where the
size and complexity of the object make it hard to show the level of detail
necessary and still fit the views on one sheet. When this is the case, a
removed view can be used. There are two different ways to indicate the
viewing direction for removed views. One is to use a view indicator arrow
to show the direction of sight, as shown in Figure 7.4a. The other is to use a
viewing-plane line, as shown in Figure 7.4b. Clearly label the removed
view.7.4 Indicating Removed Views
7.1 Visualizing and Drawing Complex Cylindrical Shapes
The illustrations in Figure 7.5 show how to visualize cylindrical features
being cut from a rectangular block (prism). Compare each illustration
showing the material being removed with the drawing.7.5 Visualizing and Drawing Cylindrical Shapes
In Figure 7.5a there is no line where the contoured surface of the rounded
top joins the straight planar sides. The top view appears as a rectangle. The
centerline for the rounded top is shown in all three views. Consider these
questions as you look at Figure 7.5a:
In this drawing, how many views are necessary?
Which views are repetitive?
Is the centerline required to locate the rounded top?In Figure 7.5b, the material for the center hole is removed. Then, hidden
lines are added to the top and side view showing the limiting elements of
the cylindrical hole. As you look at Figure 7.5b note:
In the front view the hole appears round.
The centerlines in the drawing locate the hole as well as the rounded top,
since they are concentric.
In Figure 7.5c the counterbored holes are created. As you look at Figure
7.5c ask yourself:
How many lines are used to show the counterbore in the side and top
views?
How many views are necessary?
In Figure 7.5d a portion of the top surface is removed. Notice how those
lines appear in the top and side views. How many views are necessary now?
In Figures 7.5a and 7.5b only one view is required.
In Figure 7.5c, the side view or top view or a note specifying the depth of
the counterbore is needed. The counterbore is five lines.
In Figure 7.5d the top or side view or a note is required. The side view is
probably a better choice, because it shows more about the shape than the
top view.7.2 Cylinders When Sliced
Cylinders are often machined to form plane or other types of surfaces.
Figure 7.6a shows a single machined cut that created two normal surfaces.
Normal surfaces appear true shape in the view where the line of sight is
perpendicular to the surface. In the two other views that normal surface
appears on edge. The back half remains unchanged.
7.6 Showing Views of Cylinders with Planar Surfaces Cut Away
In Figure 7.6b, two stepped cuts form four normal surfaces. Note that
surface 7–8 (top view) is through the center of the cylinder, producing in
the side view line 21–24 and in the front view surface 11–14–16–15, which
is equal in width to the diameter of the cylinder. Surface 15–16 (front view)
shows in the top view as 7–8–Arc 4. Surface 11–14 (front view) shows in
the top view as 5–6–Arc 3–8–7–Arc 2.Figure 7.6c shows a part with two coaxial cylindrical features, which is cut
to form a normal surface parallel to the axis of the cylinders.
STEP by STEP
Plotting Curves by Hand
Example 1Steps 1–3 apply to both illustrated examples.
Given the front and right-side view, project the correct view of the
curve into the top view. Break up the curve into several points and locate
them in the adjacent view.
Project the points along projection lines into the top view from the
front view. Transfer the depth from the side view, using the back surface as
a reference plane.
Draw the curve through the points.
Example 27.3 Cylinders and Ellipses
If a cylinder is cut by an inclined plane, as shown in Figure 7.7a, the
inclined surface is bounded by an ellipse. This ellipse will appear as a circle
in the top view, as a straight line in the front view, and as an ellipse in the
side view. Note that circle 1 appears circular in the top view regardless of
the angle of the cut. If the cut is at 45° from horizontal, it would also appear
as a circle in the side view.7.7 Elliptical Surfaces on Cylinders
When a circular shape is shown inclined in another view and projected into
the adjacent view as shown in Figure 7.7b, it will appear as an ellipse, even
though the shape is a circle. The inclined ellipse in Figure 7.7c is not shown
true size and shape in any of the standard views given. You will learn in
Chapter 9 how to create auxiliary views to show the true size and shape of
inclined surfaces like these.
7.4 Intersections and Tangencies
Where a curved surface is tangent to a plane surface (Figure 7.8a) no line is
drawn, but when it intersects a plane surface, as in Figure 7.8b, a definite
edge is formed.7.8 Intersections and Tangencies
Figure 7.8c shows that when curves join each other or plane surfaces
smoothly (i.e., they are tangent) a line is not drawn to show where they
come together. If a combination of curves creates a vertical surface, as in
Figure 7.8d, the vertical surface is shown as a line (here in the top view).
When plane surfaces join a contoured surface, a line is not shown if they are
tangent, but is shown if they intersect. Figures 7.8e–h show examples of
planes joining contoured surfaces.
Intersections of Cylinders
Figure 7.9a shows an example of a small cylinder intersecting a large
cylinder. When the intersection is small, its curved shape is not plotted
accurately because it adds little to the sketch or drawing for the time it
takes. Instead it is shown as a straight line.7.9 Intersections of Cylinders
When the intersection is larger, it can be approximated by drawing an arc
with the radius the same as that of the large cylinder, as shown in Figure
7.9b.
Large intersections can be plotted accurately by selecting points along the
curve to project, as shown in Figure 7.9c.
Tip
Using CAD tools you can locate the center and points on the major and
minor axis and use the CAD software’s ellipse tool to draw the whole
ellipse through the points. Then, trim off the extra portion.
A similar technique works when using a template.
When the cylinders are the same diameter, their intersections appear as
straight lines in the adjoining view, as shown in Figure 7.9d. When you areusing 3D modeling, the accurate intersection of the surfaces is typically
represented (see Figure 7.10).

To Show or Not to Show: Tangent Surfaces in Solid ModelsWhen you are creating solid models of contoured surfaces, it can be very
useful to show the “tangent edges” where the contoured surface intersects
the model. These lines that depict where the contoured surface ends and
where the planar surface begins are not typically drawn in orthographic
drawing views, unless the drawing might be confusing without them. When
it is necessary to show the tangent edges, use a phantom line for them.
Using a phantom line to show the tangent edges of the model in the
pictorial view is often necessary on parts that have many fillets and rounds;
otherwise, the view generated by the software may not show the part
clearly.
Most CAD software allows you to set the display of tangent edges both for
the entire drawing and for individual views.
Even when you are creating drawings using a CAD system you should
follow standard drawing conventions. Knowing your CAD software well is
important so that you can manage settings like those for tangent edges to
show your drawing clearly.7.5 Fillets and Rounds
A rounded interior corner is called a fillet. A rounded exterior corner is
called a round (Figure 7.11a). Sharp corners are usually avoided in
designing parts to be cast or forged because they are difficult to produce
and can weaken the part.
7.11 Rough and Finished Surfaces
Two intersecting rough surfaces produce a rounded corner (Figure 7.11b). If
one of these surfaces is machined, as shown in Figure 7.11c, or if both
surfaces are machined, as shown in Figure 7.11d, the corner becomes sharp.
In drawings, a rounded corner means that both intersecting surfaces are
rough. A sharp corner means that one or both surfaces are machined. Do not
shade fillets and rounds on multiview drawings. The presence of the curved
surfaces is indicated only where they appear as arcs, unless it is done to call
attention to them.3D CAD software varies in its ability to create complex blends for fillets
and rounds. Figure 7.12 shows a CAD model with complex fillets. Figure
7.13 shows complex 3D CAD rounds.
7.12 Fillets on a CAD Model (Courtesy of Ross Traeholt.)7.13 Rounds on a CAD Model of a Design for a Three-Hole Punch (Courtesy of Douglas Wintin.)
7.6 Runouts
Small curves called runouts are used to represent fillets that connect with
plane surfaces tangent to cylinders, as shown in Figures 7.14a–d. The
runouts should have a radius equal to that of the fillet and a curvature of
about one eighth of a circle, as shown in Figure 7.15c. Figures 7.14e–n
show more examples of conventional representations for fillets, rounds, and
runouts.7.14 Conventional Fillets, Rounds, and Runouts
7.15 Runouts
Runouts from different filleted intersections will appear different owing to
the shapes of the horizontal intersecting members. In Figures 7.14e and
7.14f, the runouts differ because the top surface of the web is flat in Figure
7.14e, whereas the top surface of the web in Figure 7.14f is considerably
rounded.When two different sizes of fillets intersect, the direction of the runout is
dictated by the larger fillet, as shown in Figures 7.14g and 7.14j.
7.7 Conventional Edges
Rounded and filleted intersections eliminate sharp edges and can make it
difficult to present the shape clearly. In some cases, as shown in Figure
7.16a, the true projection may be misleading. There is a conventional way
of showing rounded and filleted edges for the sake of clarity. Added lines
depicting rounded and filleted edges, as shown in Figures 7.16b and 7.16c,
give a clearer representation, even though it is not the true projection.
Project the added lines from the intersections of the surfaces as if the fillets
and rounds were not present.
images
7.16 Conventional Representation of a Rail
Figure 7.17 shows top views for each given front view. The first set of top
views have very few lines, even though they are the true projection. The
second set of top views, where lines are added to represent the rounded and
filleted edges, are quite clear. Note the use of small Y shapes where
rounded or filleted edges meet a rough surface. If an edge intersects a
finished surface, no Y shape is shown.

7.8 Necessary Views
What are the absolutely minimum views required to completely define an
object?
As you have already seen, sometimes only a single view with a note about
the part’s thickness is enough to define the shape (Figure 7.18). Sometimes
two views are required (Figure 7.19). For complex parts three or more
views may be required (Figure 7.20).
images
7.18 One-View Drawing

7.19 Two-View Drawing
images
7.20 Three-View Drawing
In each set of views shown in Figure 7.21, three views are shown, but only
two of the three are required.images
7.21 Three-View Drawings Showing Unnecessary Views Eliminated
When deciding which views to show, keep in mind the following:
Show sufficient views to completely describe the shape.
Show the right-hand view instead of the left-hand view if both show the
object equally well.
Choose the top view rather than the bottom view.
Show long parts horizontally on the sheet for two reasons: (1) they fit
better; (2) they tend to appear even longer when shown vertically.
Make it your goal to communicate the information clearly. If an
additional view helps toward this goal, show it. Keep in mind that
drawings are easier to read and update if they are simpler, rather than
more complex.
7.9 Partial Views
A view may not need to be complete to show what is necessary to clearly
describe the object. This is called a partial view and is used to save
sketching time and make the drawing less confusing to read. You can use a
break line to limit the partial view, as shown in Figure 7.22a, or limit a view
by the contour of the part shown, as shown in Figure 7.22b. If the view is
symmetrical, you can draw a half-view on one side of the centerline, asshown in Figure 7.22c, or break out a partial view, as shown in Figure
7.22d. The half-views should be the near side, as shown.
images
7.22 Partial Views
When you are drawing a partial view, do not place a break line where it will
coincide with a visible or hidden line, as this may cause the drawing to be
misinterpreted.
Occasionally, the distinctive features of an object are on opposite sides. In
either complete side view there will be a considerable overlapping of
shapes. In cases like this, two side views are often the best solution, as
shown in Figure 7.23. The views are partial views, and certain visible and
hidden lines have been omitted for clarity.
images
7.23 Partial Side Views
Showing Enlarged Details
Figure 7.24 shows drawing details clearly by including detail views drawn
at a larger scale. When adding a detail, draw a circle around the features
that will be included in the detail as shown in Figure 7.24 (top). Place the
detail view on the sheet as you would a removed view. Label successivedetails with the word DETAIL followed by a letter, as in DETAIL A,
DETAIL B, and so on, and note the scale for the detail below its name.
images
7.24 Enlarged Detail
Enlarged details are easy to generate using CAD software.
Conventional Breaks
To shorten the view of a long object, you can use break lines as shown in
Figure 7.25. Figure 7.26 shows two views of a garden rake. When the long
handle of the rake is shown to scale, the details of the drawing are small and
hard to read. Using a break to leave out a portion of the handle allows the
scale for the ends to be increased to show the details clearly.
images
7.25 Conventional Break
images
7.26 Conventional breaks allow for increased scale to show detail.
7.10 Alignment of Views
Always draw views in the standard arrangement shown in Figure 7.27 to be
sure that your drawings are not misinterpreted. Figure 7.27a shows an offsetguide that requires three views. Their correct arrangement is shown in
Figure 7.27b. The top view should be directly above the front view, and the
right-side view directly to the right of the front view—not out of alignment,
as in Figure 7.27c, unless absolutely necessary and then the viewing
directions must be clearly labeled in a pictorial view.
images
7.27 Alignment of Views for Third-Angle Projection
Never draw the views in reversed positions, with the bottom over the front
view or the right side to the left of the front view, as shown in Figure 7.27d.
Even though the views do line up with the front view, this arrangement
could be misread.
Figure 7.28 shows three views in the correct alignment, but this drawing
has a poor choice for the front view. The front view should show the shape
of the object clearly. One way to consider this is that the front view shows
the most information about the material that would have to be removed
from a block.
images
7.28 Three Views in Correct Alignment but Poor Choice of Front View
After design sketches are completed, you will usually follow them with
detailed CAD models and drawings. In CAD drawings, you should applythe same rules for arranging views, clearly depicting the subject of the
drawing, using the proper line patterns and lineweights, and following all
the necessary standards as used in drawings created by hand.
Tip
Because CAD makes it easy to move whole views, it is tempting to place
views where they fit on the screen or plotted sheet and not in the standard
or alternative projected arrangement. This is not acceptable, unless you
label the viewing direction and show a removed view. Use removed views
only when they are really necessary and be sure to label them clearly.
7.11 Removed Views
A removed view is a complete or partial view removed to another place on
the sheet so that it is no longer in direct projection with any other view, as
shown in the upper left corner of Figure 7.29. A removed view may be used
to show a feature of the object more clearly, possibly to a larger scale, or to
save drawing a complete regular view. A viewing-plane line is used to
indicate the part being viewed. The arrows at the corners show the direction
of sight. The removed views should be labeled View A–A or View B–B and
so on; the letters refer to those placed at the corners of the viewing-plane
line. A view indicator arrow can also be used to show the viewing direction
for the removed view, as shown in Figure 7.30. Be sure to label theremoved view clearly and provide its scale if it is different from the overall
drawing scale.
images
7.29 Removed View Using Viewing-Plane Line
images
7.30 Removed View Using View Indicator Arrow
Architectural drawings often cannot fit even two standard views on the
sheet. The sheets are typically labeled to indicate the standard views, as in
Figure 7.31. Views are labeled, for example, “Plan” for the top view, “East
Elevation” for the side view seen from the east compass direction, and so
forth. Additional views use a viewing-plane line or arrow to indicate the
direction of sight.
images
7.31 Architectural Drawing with Views Labeled (Courtesy of CH2M HILL.)
In large civil drawings and other complex drawings such as the electrical
drawing in Figure 7.32, one entire view may not be able to be shown clearly
on a single sheet. For projects that extend sheet to sheet, match lines are
often drawn showing how one sheet matches to the previous one.
images7.32 A Portion of a Building System Electrical Drawing Using Match Lines (Courtesy of CH2M HILL.)
7.12 Right-Hand and Left-Hand Parts
Often, parts function in pairs of similar opposite parts, but opposite parts
can rarely be exactly alike. For example, the right-front fender of an
automobile cannot be the same shape as the left-front fender. A left-hand
part is not simply a right-hand part turned around; the two parts are mirror
images and are not interchangeable.
On sketches and drawings a left-hand part is noted as LH, and a right-hand
part as RH. In Figure 7.33a, the part in front of the mirror is a right-hand
part, and the image shows the left-hand part. No matter how the object is
turned, the mirror image will show the left-hand part. Figures 7.33b and c
show left-hand and right-hand drawings of the same object.
images
7.33 Right-Hand and Left-Hand Parts
Ordinarily you draw only one of two opposite parts and label the one that is
drawn with a note, such as LH PART SHOWN, RH OPPOSITE. If the
opposite-hand shape is not clear, you should make a separate sketch or
drawing to show it clearly and completely.
7.13 Revolution ConventionsRegular multiview projections are sometimes awkward, confusing, or
actually misleading. For example, Figure 7.34a shows an object that has
three triangular ribs, three holes equally spaced in the base, and a keyway.
The right-side view is a regular projection, but is not recommended—the
lower ribs appear in a foreshortened position, the holes do not appear in
their true relation to the rim of the base, and the keyway is projected as a
confusion of hidden lines.
images
7.34 Revolution Conventions
The method shown in Figure 7.34c is preferred because it is simpler to read
and requires less time to sketch. Each of the features mentioned has been
revolved in the front view to lie along the vertical centerline, from which it
is projected to the correct side view.
Figures 7.34d and 7.34e show regular views of a flange with several small
holes. The hidden holes are confusing and take unnecessary time to show.
Figure 7.34f shows the holes revolved for clarity.
Figure 7.35 shows a regular projection with a confusing foreshortening of
its inclined arm. In Figure 7.35b, the lower arm is revolved to line up
vertically in the front view so that it projects the true length in the side view
and makes the object’s symmetry clear.images
7.35 Revolution Conventions
Revolutions like these are frequently used in connection with sectioning.
Revolved sectional views are called aligned sections.
In views generated from 3D CAD models, revolving the features to show
their true size is not required, but it is preferred, especially in hand-drawn
and 2D CAD drawings.

Chapter SummaryIrregular curves can be plotted by identifying points on the object. The
points can be projected to approximate the boundaries of the curved
surface.
Drawing conventions define usual practices for the representation of
features such as holes, bosses, ribs, webs, lugs, fillets, and rounds.
Use the same main practices to arrange drawing views on the sheet for
both hand-drawn and CAD drawings. Show and label enlarged details
and removed views. Use partial views and leave out hidden lines as long
as the object is shown clearly.
When curved and planar surfaces intersect, an edge is formed that is
represented by a line in the drawing. When curved and planar surfaces
are tangent, no edge is formed, so no line is needed. If the drawing is not
clear without it, use a phantom line to show tangencies.
Common types of holes are through, blind, countersunk, counterbored,
and spotfaced.
Fillets, rounds, and runouts are special types of tangent contours formed
on parts with rounded edges.
When necessary for clarity, features are sometimes shown in a revolved
position using revolution conventions.
Break lines can be used to leave out a section of a part where it is
uniform or repetitive. Often, this is done to enlarge the scale of the
remaining portions of the part so that details can be seen clearly.
Review Questions1. If the top view of an object shows a drilled through hole, how many
hidden lines will be necessary in the front view to describe the hole?
How many if the hole is countersunk? Counterbored?
2. If a plane surface intersects a contoured surface, should you show a line
in the drawing to represent that intersection? What about when the plane
is tangent?
3. What is a fillet? A round? A lug? A boss? Knurling?
4. How do you show right-hand and left-hand parts?
5. Which is easier, creating an enlarged detail by hand or using a CAD
system?

Overview
Technical drawings often represent a single part with a complex interior
structure, or many different parts in a mechanical assembly, building,bridge, toy, or other product. When you are creating a drawing, if the
interior structure cannot be shown clearly by using hidden lines, you should
use a section view to reveal the internal features of the part.
To visualize a section view, think of slicing through the object as if you
were cutting through an apple or melon. This familiar cutaway view—
looking onto the cut portion of the object—is called a section view, or
sometimes a cross section.
Special conventions, some that depart from the practices you have learned
for orthographic projection, are used to make section views easier to
understand. 3D CAD modeling software often cannot generate section
views that meet all these special conventions, so current practice allows for
direct sections of the 3D model. 2D and 3D CAD users need to understand
section views thoroughly to use them effectively.
Selecting the section view that best shows the drawing information is a skill
that takes practice.
Understanding Sections
Section views are used for three main purposes:
To document the design and manufacture of single parts that are
manufactured as one piece.
To document how multiple parts are to be assembled or built.To aid in visualizing the internal workings of a design.
Sections of Single Parts
If you have ever cut a melon in half, you have created a full section in real
life (Figure 8.1). To visualize a section of a single part is no different. Think
of the part as being sliced through by the cutting plane, as if the plane were
a giant cleaver. Once the object is cut, the closer half is pulled away,
showing the inside construction of the part.
8.1 Full Section of a Melon
Full SectionsWhen the part is cut fully in half, the resulting view is called a full section,
as shown in Figure 8.2. Figure 8.3 shows a technical drawing of the part
from Figure 8.2 that does not use a section view. Notice how confusing all
the hidden lines look. Figure 8.4 shows the same drawing, but this time the
right-side view is replaced with a right section view. Now it is much easier
to understand.
8.2 Slicing a Single Part8.3 Front and Right-Side Views. Parts with a lot of interior detail may have so many hidden lines
that their views are confusing.8.4 Front and Right-Side View in Full Section. Using a section view makes it easier to see interior
details.
In a drawing with a section view, the missing half is imagined to be
removed and is not actually shown removed in any view except the section
view. A line called the cutting-plane line provides the information
necessary for understanding where the part was cut. The arrows at the ends
of the cutting-plane line indicate the direction of sight for the section view.
In the section view, the areas that would have been in actual contact with
the cutting plane (refer to the example shown in Figure 8.2) are shown with
section lining. Those areas are crosshatched with thin parallel section lines.
The Cutting Plane
The cutting plane is shown in a view adjacent to the section view, in this
case the front view. In this view, the cutting plane appears edgewise as a
thick dashed line—the cutting-plane line.
The arrows at the ends of the cutting-plane line indicate the direction of
sight for the section view, as shown in Figure 8.4. The arrows point toward
the section being viewed as shown in Figures 8.4 and 8.5, not away from it,
as in Figure 8.6.8.5 Cutting-plane Line Indicates Direction of Sight
8.6 Arrows should not point to removed portion.Lines behind the Cutting Plane
The now-exposed visible edges of the object behind the cutting plane are
shown, but they are not crosshatched with section lining, because they were
not cut. Figure 8.7 shows an example of object edges exposed by the cutting
plane appearing as visible lines in the section view. In a full section, the
location of the cutting plane is obvious from the section itself, so the
cutting-plane line is often omitted. You will learn about other section types
that require the cutting-plane line to be understood later in this chapter.
Cutting-plane lines should be used wherever necessary for clarity.
8.7 Some previously hidden edges of the part are visible in the section view.
Step by Step
Visualizing a Full Section
Choose a Cutting PlaneThis illustration shows a collar to be sectioned. To produce a clear
section showing both the counterbored recess and the smaller hole near the
top of the object, choose a cutting plane that will pass through the vertical
centerline in the front view, and imagine the right half of the object
removed.
Identify the Surfaces
The pictorial drawing of the remaining half is shown at right. The first
step in projecting the section view is making sure that you interpret the
object correctly. Identifying the surfaces on the object can help.Surfaces R, S, T, U, and V have been labeled on the given views and the
pictorial view.
Which surface is R in the front view?
Which surface is U in the top view?
Are they normal, inclined, or oblique surfaces?
Can you identify the counterbored recess in each view?
Draw the Section View
To draw the section view, omit the portion of the object in front of the
cutting plane. You will be drawing only the portion that remains.Determine which are solid parts of the object the cutting plane will pass
through. Hint: The outside of an object can never be a hole; it must be
solid, unless the cutting plane passes through a slot to the exterior.
The points that will be projected to create the section view have been
identified for you in the example shown.The three surfaces produced by the cutting plane are bounded by points 
1 − 2 − 3 − 4 and 5 − 6 − 7 − 8 − 9 − 10 and 13 − 14 − 12 − 11.
These are shown hatched.
Each sectioned area is completely enclosed by a boundary of visible lines.
In addition to the cut surfaces, the section view shows all visible parts
behind the cutting plane.
No hidden lines are shown. However, the corresponding section shown in
this step is incomplete, because visible lines are missing.
Project the Visible LinesFrom the direction the section is viewed, the top surface (V) of the
object appears in the section as a visible line (12 − 11 − 16 − 15).
The bottom surface of the object appears similarly as 
14 − 13 − 7 − 6 − 3 − 2. The bottom surface of the counterbored recess
appears in the section as line 19 − 20.Also, the back half of the counterbored recess and the drilled hole appear as
rectangles in the section at 19 − 20 − 15 − 16 and 3 − 4 − 5 − 6. These
points must also be projected. The finished view is shown at right.
Notice that since all cut surfaces are part of the same object, the hatching
must all run in the same direction.
8.1 Placement of Section Views
Section views can replace the normal top, front, side, or other standard
orthographic views in the standard view arrangement. Figure 8.8 shows an
example. In this drawing, the front view of the object is shown in section.
Only two views are necessary. The front view is shown as a section view,
and the cutting-plane line is shown in the right-side view.8.8 Section views can replace standard orthographic views. (Courtesy of Wood’s Power-Grip. Co. Inc.)
In Figure 8.9a, the object is cut through with a plane parallel to the front
view. The front half of the object is imagined removed. The resulting full
section may be referred to as the “front view in section” because it occupies
the front view position.
8.9 Front and Top Views in Section
In Figure 8.9b, the cutting plane is a horizontal plane (which would appear
as a line in the front view). The upper half of the object is imagined
removed. The resulting full section is shown in place of the top view.
When adding a section view to your drawing, keep in mind that your
purpose is to document and convey information about your design and
show the information in the way that best achieves this objective.
8.2 Labeling Cutting PlanesIn Figure 8.10, two cutting planes are shown, one a plane parallel to the
front view and the other a plane parallel to the side view, both of which
appear edgewise in the top view. Each section is completely independent of
the other and drawn as if the other were not present.
8.10 Front and Side Views in Section
For section A–A, the front half of the object is imagined removed. The back
half is then viewed in the direction of the arrows for a front view, and the
resulting section is a front view in section.For section B–B, the right half of the object is imagined removed. The left
half is then viewed in the direction of the arrows for a right-side view, and
the resulting section is a right-side view in section. The cutting-plane lines
are preferably drawn through an exterior view (in this case the top view, as
shown) instead of a section view.
The cutting-plane lines in Figure 8.10 are shown for purposes of illustration
only. They are generally omitted in cases where the location of the cutting
plane is obvious.
8.3 Line Precedence
When a cutting-plane line coincides with a centerline, the cutting-plane line
takes precedence. When the cutting-plane line would obscure important
details in the view, just the ends of the line outside the view and the arrows
can be shown as in Figure 8.11. When you do this, be sure to leave a small
but visible gap between the lines of the view and the small portion of the
cutting-plane line.8.11 The cutting-plane line takes precedence over the centerline unless it obscures important detail.
8.4 Rules for Lines in Section Views
When creating section views follow these general rules:
Show edges and contours that are now visible behind the cutting plane;
otherwise a section will appear to be made up of disconnected and
unrelated parts. (Occasionally, visible lines behind the cutting plane may
be omitted, particularly from those generated from 3D models.)
Omit hidden lines in section views. Section views are used to show
interior detail without a confusion of hidden lines, so add them only if
necessary to understand the part.
Sometimes hidden lines are necessary for clarity and should be used in
such cases, especially if their use will make it possible to omit a view
(Figure 8.12d).8.12 Right and Wrong Lines in Section Views
A sectioned area is always completely bounded by a visible outline—
never by a hidden line, because in every case the cut surfaces will be the
closest surface in the section view and therefore their boundary lines will
be visible (Figure 8.12e).
In a section view of an object, the section lines in all hatched areas for
that object must be parallel, not as shown in Figure 8.12f. The use of
section lining in opposite directions is an indication of different parts, as
when two or more parts are adjacent in an assembly drawing.
A visible line can never cross a sectioned area in a view of a single part.
This would be impossible on the full section of a single part because the
section lines are all in the same plane. A line across it would indicate a
change of plane (Figure 8.12g). In an assembly section, this would be
possible. You will learn about assemblies later in the chapter.
Tip
Learning the rules for section lining saves time. Extra hidden lines and
hatching that is denser than necessary take longer to draw and make
drawings slower to print. They also make drawings harder to read.Tip
In CAD, when views can be placed by projection from a 3D model, saving
time by omitting a view is not a big concern, but saving space on the
drawing sheet by leaving out a view often may be.
8.5 Cutting-Plane Line Style
Figure 8.13a shows the preferred style of line to use for the cutting-plane
line. It is made up of equal dashes, each about 6 mm (1/4
′′
) long ending in
arrowheads. This form works especially well for drawings. The alternative
style, shown in Figure 8.13b, uses alternating long dashes and pairs of short
dashes and ends with arrowheads. This style has been in general use for a
long time, so you may still see it on drawings. Both lines are drawn the
same thickness as visible lines. The arrowheads at the ends of the cutting￾plane line indicate the direction in which the cutaway object is viewed (as
was shown in Figure 8.5).8.13 Cutting-Plane Lines (Full Size)
Use capital letters at the ends of the cutting-plane line when necessary to
help the drawing’s reader match each cutting-plane line to its section view.
Figure 8.10 showed an example where the cutting plane is labeled and the
resulting section view is labeled to match. This most often occurs in the
case of multiple sections or removed sections, which are discussed later in
the chapter.
An alternative method for showing the cutting plane is to draw the cutting￾line pattern and then draw reference arrows pointing to it in the direction of
sight (Figure 8.14a).8.14 Alternative Methods for Showing a Cutting Plane
Especially on architectural drawings, the center of the cutting-plane line is
often left out and stylized arrows are used to identify the cutting plane
(Figure 8.14b).
The arrows on the cutting-plane lines are made larger than the dimension
arrowheads to call attention to the location of sections and removed views.
Make the arrows 1.4 times the drawing letter height. Make the view label
text 1.4 times the drawing letter height also. For example, an 8.5′′×11′′
drawing uses text that is .125′′(1/8
′′
) tall as a minimum, so for this sheet
size, use arrows on the cutting plane .175′′ (about 3/16
′′
, or about 4.5 mm)
tall (Figure 8.13).
Visualizing Cutting-Plane Direction
Correct and incorrect relations between cutting-plane lines and
corresponding section views are shown in Figure 8.15.8.15 Correct and Incorrect Cutting-Plane Line Placement
8.6 Section-Lining Technique
The correct method of drawing section lines is shown in Figure 8.16a.
When drawing by hand, use a sharp, medium-grade pencil (H or 2H) to
draw uniformly thin section lines, or hatching (a term meaning closely
spaced parallel lines). There should be a marked contrast between the thin
section lines and the thick visible outlines of the part.8.16 Correct and Incorrect Section-Lining Technique
Draw section lines at 45° from horizontal unless they would be parallel or
perpendicular to major edges of the part, in which case use a different
angle. Figure 8.16b shows an example of section lines drawn at a different
angle to prevent them from being parallel or perpendicular to visible
outlines.Space the lines as evenly as possible by eye (for most drawings, about 
2.5mm(1/10
′′) apart). The spacing interval depends on the size of the
drawing or of the sectioned area, with larger drawings having wider
spacing. In a smaller drawing the spacing interval may be as small as 
1.5mm(1/16 ′′); in a large drawing, it may be 3mm(1/8 ′′) or more. As a
rule, space the lines as generously as possible, yet close enough to clearly
distinguish the sectioned areas.
Keep extension lines and dimension values off sectioned areas. If there is
no alternative, omit the section lines behind the dimensions (Figure 8.16c).
Tip
Beginners tend to draw section lines too close together. This is tedious and
makes small inaccuracies in spacing obvious. After the first few lines, look
back repeatedly at the original spacing to avoid gradually increasing or
decreasing the intervals between the lines.
Section Lining Large Areas
When adding section lines to a large area, use outline sectioning, where the
center portion of the hatched area is left blank to save time and make the
view more legible, as shown in Figure 8.17.8.17 Outline Sectioning (Courtesy of Associated Construction Engineering.)
Section-Lining Symbols
Section-lining symbols (Figure 8.18) may be used to indicate specific
materials. These symbols represent general material types only, such as cast
iron, brass, and steel. Because there are so many different types of materials
(there are hundreds of types of steel, for example), a general name or
symbol is not enough. A detailed specification listing the material must be
lettered in the form of a note or in the title strip.8.18 Symbols for Section Lining
The general-purpose section lining (which is the same as that for cast iron)
may be used to represent any material on the detail drawing for a single
part.
Using different section-lining patterns helps you distinguish different
materials, especially on assembly drawings, but it is acceptable to use the
general-purpose symbol shown at different angles for different parts.
Section Lining in CAD
CAD programs usually include libraries that allow you to select from a
variety of section-lining patterns, making it easy to use different patterns,angles, and scales for the spacing of the pattern. When using CAD software
to hatch an area in the drawing, be careful to specify a scale that relates to
the printed drawing scale for that sheet. Otherwise, the hatching may turn
out so dense that the object appears to be filled in solid, or so sparse that
you do not see any hatching (Figure 8.19).
8.19 Incorrect Hatching in a CAD Drawing
8.7 Half SectionsSymmetrical objects can be shown effectively using a special type of
section view called a half section (Figure 8.20). A half section exposes the
interior of half of the object and the exterior of the other half. This is done
by removing one quarter of the object. Half sections are not widely used to
create detail drawings showing how to make a single part because it can be
difficult to show all the dimensions clearly when some internal features are
only partly shown in the sectioned half (Figure 8.20b).
8.20 Half Section
In general,
Omit hidden lines from both halves of a half section, whenever possible.
Use a centerline to divide the sectioned half and the unsectioned half, as
shown in Figure 8.20b.Half-section drawings are most useful in showing an assembly where it is
often necessary to show both internal and external construction in one
drawing view and usually without dimensioning. A broken-out section may
be preferred in some cases.
8.8 Broken Out Sections
It often happens that only a partial section of a view is all that is needed to
expose interior shapes. Such a section, limited by a break line, is called a
broken out section.
In Figure 8.21, a full or half section is not necessary, and a small broken out
section is sufficient to explain the construction.8.21 Broken Out Section
In Figure 8.22, a half section would have caused the removal of half the
keyway. The keyway is preserved by breaking out around it. In this case,
the section is limited partly by a break line and partly by a centerline in the
drawing.
8.22 Break around KeywaySteam Launch Engine, Modeled Actual Size and Sectioned to Illustrate Assembly and Function. This
CAD model was created by William L. Gould from an 1879 “drafting exercise handbook.” (©

8.9 Revolved SectionsThe shape of the cross section of a bar, arm, spoke, or other elongated
object can be shown in the longitudinal view by using a revolved section.
To create a revolved section, first imagine a cutting plane perpendicular to
the centerline or axis of the object, as shown in Figure 8.23a. Next, revolve
the plane 90° about a centerline at right angles to the axis, as shown in
Figures 8.23b and c.
8.23 Using the Cutting Plane in Revolved Sections
The visible lines adjacent to a revolved section may be broken out if
desired, as shown in Figure 8.24.
8.24 Conventional Breaks Used with Revolved Sections
When you superimpose the revolved section over the top of the view, be
sure that any original lines of the view covered by the revolved view are
removed (Figure 8.25a).8.25 Common Errors in Drawing Revolved Sections
Show the true shape of the revolved section, regardless of the direction of
the lines in the view (Figure 8.25b).
Figure 8.26 shows examples of how revolved sections look in a drawing.
8.26 Revolved Sections
8.10 Removed SectionsA removed section (Figure 8.27) is one that is not in direct projection from
the view containing the cutting plane—that is, it is not positioned in
agreement with the standard arrangement of views. Be sure to keep the
section in its normal orientation and do not turn it a different direction on
the sheet. If you must rotate the view, use a rotation arrow as shown in
Figure 8.28 and note the angle the view was rotated.
8.27 Removed Section8.28 Rotation Arrow Symbol. Use this to label a view that has been rotated (h = letter height in
the drawing).
Removed sections should be labeled, such as section A–A and section B–B,
corresponding to the letters at the ends of the cutting-plane line (Figure
8.27). They should be arranged in alphabetical order from left to right on
the sheet. Section letters should be used in alphabetical order, but letters I,
O, and Q should not be used because they are easily confused with the
numeral 1 or zero. Figure 8.29 shows several removed sections.8.29 Removed Sections
A removed section is often a partial section, in which only a portion of the
section view is drawn. Removed sections are frequently drawn to an
enlarged scale (Figure 8.29) to show detail and provide space for
dimensions. When using an enlarged scale be sure to indicate the scale
below the section view’s title, as in Figure 8.27.
A removed section should be placed so that it no longer lines up in
projection with any other view. It should be separated clearly from the
standard arrangement of views (see Figure 8.30). Whenever possible,removed sections should be on the same sheet as the regular views. If a
section must be placed on a different sheet, cross-references should be
given on the related sheets. A note should be given below the section title,
such as
8.30 Architectural Drawing Showing Labeled Removed Section Views (Courtesy of Locati Architects.)
Section B-B on Sheet 4, Zone A3
A similar note should be placed on the sheet on which the cutting-plane line
is shown, with a leader pointing to the cutting-plane line and referring to thesheet on which the section will be found. Sometimes it is convenient to
place removed sections on centerlines extended from the section cuts
(Figure 8.31).
8.31 Removed Sections on Centerlines
8.11 Offset Sections
In sectioning complex objects, it is often desirable to show features that do
not lie in a straight line by “offsetting” or bending the cutting plane. These
are called offset sections.
In Figure 8.32a the cutting plane is offset in several places to include the
hole at the left end, one of the parallel slots, the rectangular recess, and one
of the holes at the right end. The front portion of the object is then imaginedto be removed (Figure 8.32b). The path of the cutting plane is shown by the
cutting-plane line in the top view (Figure 8.32c), and the resulting offset
section is shown in the front view.
8.32 Offset Section
The offsets or bends in the cutting plane are all 90°.
The bends in the cutting plane are never shown in the section view.
Figure 8.32 also illustrates how hidden lines in a section eliminate the need
for an additional view. In this case, an extra view would be needed to show
the small boss on the back if hidden lines were not shown.
Figure 8.33 shows an example of multiple offset sections. Notice that the
visible background shapes appear in each section view without the use of
hidden lines. It is also acceptable to show only the cut portion, but theviews are easier to interpret when the lines that are visible behind the
cutting plane are shown.
8.33 Three Offset Sections
8.12 Ribs in Section
To avoid giving a false impression of thickness and solidity, ribs, webs, gear
teeth, and other similar flat features are not hatched with section lining even
though the cutting plane slices them. For example, in Figure 8.34, the
cutting plane A–A slices through the center of the vertical web, or rib, and
the web is not sectioned (Figure 8.34b). Thin features are not hatched even
though the cutting plane passes lengthwise through them. The incorrect
section is shown in Figure 8.34c. Note the false impression of thickness or
solidity resulting from section-lining the rib.8.34 Web in Section
If the cutting plane passes crosswise through a rib or any thin member, as in
section B–B, section-line the feature in the usual manner, as in the top view
of Figure 8.34a.
If a rib is not sectioned when the cutting plane passes through it flatwise, it
is sometimes difficult to tell whether the rib is actually present, as, for
example, ribs A in Figure 8.35a and b. It is difficult to distinguish spaces B
as open spaces and spaces A as ribs. In such cases, double-spaced section
lining of the ribs should be used (Figure 8.35c). This consists simply of
continuing alternate section lines through the ribbed areas, as shown.8.35 Alternate Sectioning
8.13 Aligned Sections
When parts with angled elements are sectioned, the cutting plane may be
bent to pass through those features. The plane and features are then
imagined to be revolved into the original plane. For example, Figure 8.36
shows an aligned section. The cutting plane was bent to pass through the
angled arm and then revolved to a vertical position (aligned), from where it
was projected across to the section view.8.36 Aligned Section
The angle of revolution should always be less than 90° for an aligned
section.
Do not revolve features when the clarity of your drawing is not improved.
In the exercises later in the chapter, you will see examples of when
revolution should not be used.
In Figure 8.37 the cutting plane is bent to include one of the drilled and
counterbored holes in the section view. The correct section view in Figure
8.37b gives a clearer and more complete description than does the section in
Figure 8.37c, which is shown without any bend in the cutting plane.8.37 Aligned Section
In Figure 8.38a, the projecting lugs are not section-lined for the same
reason that the ribs are not sectioned. In Figure 8.38b, the projecting lugs
are located so that the cutting plane passes through them crosswise;
therefore, they are section-lined.
8.38 Aligned SectionAnother example involving rib sectioning and aligned sectioning is shown
in Figure 8.39. In the circular view, the cutting plane is offset in circular-arc
bends to include the upper hole and upper rib, the keyway and center hole,
the lower rib, and one of the lower holes. These features are imagined to be
revolved until they line up vertically and are then projected from that
position to obtain the section shown in Figure 8.39b. Note that the ribs are
not section-lined. If a regular full section of the object were drawn without
using the conventions discussed here, the resulting section (Figure 8.39c)
would be incomplete and confusing and would take more time to draw.
Showing the actual section is acceptable when it is generated from a 3D
model. When doing so, take care to provide clear views that can be
interpreted by the reader.
8.39 Symmetry of RibsIn sectioning a pulley or any spoked wheel (Figure 8.40a), it is standard
practice to revolve the spokes if necessary (if there are an odd number) and
not to section-line the spokes (Figure 8.40b). If the spoke is hatched, the
section gives a false impression of continuous metal (Figure 8.40c). If the
lower spoke is not revolved, it will be foreshortened in the sectional view,
in which it presents an “amputated” and a misleading appearance.
8.40 Spokes in Section
Figure 8.40 also illustrates correct practice in omitting visible lines in a
sectional view. Notice that spoke B is omitted in Figure 8.40b. If it is
included, as shown in Figure 8.40c, the spoke is foreshortened, difficult and
time-consuming to draw, and confusing to the reader of the drawing.
8.14 Partial ViewsIf space is limited on the paper or to save time, partial views may be used
with sectioning (Figure 8.41). Half views are shown in Figures 8.41a and b
in connection with a full section and a half section, respectively. In each
case the back half of the object in the circular view is shown, to remove the
front portion of the object and expose the back portion in the section.
8.41 Partial Views
Another method of drawing a partial view is to break out much of the
circular view, retaining only those features that are needed for minimum
representation (Figure 8.41c).
8.15 Intersections in Sections
Whenever an intersection is small or unimportant in a section, it is standard
practice to disregard the true projection of the figure of intersection, as
shown in Figures 8.42a and c. Larger intersections may be projected, as
shown in Figure 8.42b, or approximated by circular arcs, as shown for the
smaller hole in Figure 8.42d. Note that the larger hole K is the samediameter as the vertical hole. In such cases the curves of intersection
(ellipses) appear as straight lines, as shown.
8.42 Intersections
8.16 Conventional Breaks and SectionsCross-hatching is often added when showing a conventional break.
Conventional breaks are used to shorten the view of an object that is too
long to show clearly at one scale on the drawing sheet. Figure 8.43 shows
examples of hatching on conventional breaks. The parts to be broken must
have the same section throughout, or if they are tapered, they must have a
uniform taper.
8.43 Conventional breaks often show cross-hatching to show the cut material.
The breaks used on cylindrical shafts or tubes are often referred to as “S￾breaks” and are usually drawn by eye, although S-break templates are
available.
8.17 Assembly Sections
Section views are often used to create assembly drawings. Figure 8.44
shows an orthographic drawing for an assembly. Notice that the hatching on
different parts varies; it has a different hatch pattern or is hatched at a
different angle. On the same part, the hatching is always at the same angle
to help you recognize the parts easily. Solid features that do not have
interior structure are not hatched. You will learn more about these types of
drawing in Chapter 14.8.44 Assembly Section (Courtesy of Wood’s Power-Grip Co., Inc.)
Cad at Work
Computer Techniques for Sections
2D and 3D sectional views can be created using CAD. Most CAD systems
have a “hatch” command to generate the section lining and hatch patterns to
fill an area automatically. A wide variety of hatch patterns are generally
available to show materials such as steel, bronze, sand, concrete, and many
more.
Creating a full-section view from a 3D model is generally very easy. You
often need to define only the cutting plane, viewing direction, scale, and
where to place the view on the sheet. Often, the hatching for the cut
surfaces is generated automatically. Sectioned views other than full sections
can be more difficult to create. When you create an angled cutting plane
line for a section view, Autodesk Inventor automatically generates the
aligned section. Use this feature only when appropriate, such to show theinternal structure of an angled feature. To create good section drawings, you
should have a clear understanding of the standards for showing section
views.

Chapter Summary
Now that you have finished this chapter, you should be able to:
Show internal details of objects without the need for hidden lines by
using section views.
Imagine a variety of objects cut apart along a cutting-plane line.Show section lining (hatching) to indicate the solid parts of the object
that would be cut by the cutting plane.
Check that you are not showing hidden lines where they are no longer

imagined cut.

Refer to the following standard:ANSI/ASME Y14.3 Orthographic and Pictorial Views
Auxiliary View Drawing. This switch mount uses an auxiliary view to show the true size of the
inclined surface. (Courtesy of Big Sky Laser.)
Overview
Inclined planes and oblique lines do not appear true size or true length in
any of the principal planes of projection. When it is necessary to show the
true length of an oblique line or the true size of an inclined plane, an
auxiliary view must be created. The principles for creating auxiliary views
are the same whether you are using traditional drawing, sketching, or CAD:a line of sight and reference plane are defined. With traditional drawing, the
view is manually created along line-of-sight projectors. With CAD drawing,
the computer generates the view automatically if a 3D model of the object
was originally created.
Even if you are going to be using a CAD system to generate auxiliary
views, it is important to understand the theory of developable surfaces.
Some surfaces cannot be developed or “flattened out” to make an exact flat
pattern for creating parts from sheet metal, cardboard packaging, or fabric.
For example, a sphere can only be approximated. Understanding
development methods can aid you in using your CAD software to the fullest
extent.Understanding Auxiliary Views
Auxiliary views are useful for both design and documentation. Many
objects are shaped so that their principal faces are not parallel to the
standard planes of projection. For example, in Figure 9.1a the base of the
design for the bearing is shown in its true size and shape, but the rounded
upper portion is at an angle, so it does not appear true size and shape in anyof the three regular views. When creating a drawing for documentation, you
will often need to show the true size and shape of surfaces and angles.
Likewise, you may need to create true-size flat patterns for sheet metal,
packaging, and other purposes.
9.1 Regular Views and Auxiliary Views
To show the true circular shapes, use a direction of sight perpendicular to
the plane of the curve, to produce a view as shown in Figure 9.1b. The
result is an auxiliary view: an orthographic view that is not a standard
projection. This view, together with the top view, completely describes the
object. The front and right-side views are not necessary.
The Auxiliary Plane
The object shown in Figure 9.2a has an inclined surface (P) that does not
appear in its true size and shape in any regular view. To show the inclined
surface true size, the direction of sight must be perpendicular to the inclined
plane. Or using the glass box model, the auxiliary plane is aligned parallelto the inclined surface P to give a true-size view of it. The auxiliary plane
in this case is perpendicular to the frontal plane of projection and hinged to
it. It is angled to the horizontal (top) and profile (side) viewing planes.
9.2 An Auxiliary View
The horizontal and auxiliary planes are unfolded into the plane of the front
view, as shown in Figure 9.2b. Drawings do not show the planes of the
glass box, but you can think of folding lines (H/F and F/A) representing the
hinges that join the planes. The folding lines themselves are usually omitted
in the actual drawing.
Inclined surface P is shown in its true size and shape in the auxiliary view.
Note that both the top and auxiliary views show the depth of the object. One
dimension of the surface is projected directly from the front view, and the
depth is transferred from the top view.The locations of the folding lines depend on the size of the glass box and
the location of the object within it. If the object is farther down in the box,
distance Y is increased. If the object is moved back in the box, distances X
increase but are still equal. If the object is moved to the left inside the glass
box, distance Z is increased.
Primary Auxiliary Views
Any view obtained by orthographic projection onto a plane other than the
horizontal, frontal, and profile projection planes is an auxiliary view. A
primary auxiliary view is projected onto a plane that is perpendicular to one
of the principal planes of projection and is inclined to the other two. Figure
9.3 shows examples of primary auxiliary views.9.3 Primary Auxiliary Views
Visualizing an Auxiliary View as a Revolved Drawing
Figure 9.4a is a drawing showing top, front, and auxiliary views. Figure
9.4b shows the drawing revolved, as indicated by the arrows, until theauxiliary view and the front view line up horizontally. Although the views
remain exactly the same, the names of the views are changed if drawn in
this position. The auxiliary view now becomes a right-side view, and the
top view becomes an auxiliary view. Sometimes it is easier to visualize and
draw an auxiliary view when revolved to the position of a regular view in
this manner. In any case, it should be understood that an auxiliary view is
basically like any other view.9.4 Revolving a Drawing
Classification of Auxiliary Views
Auxiliary views are named for the principal dimension shown in the
auxiliary view. For example, the auxiliary views in Figure 9.5 are depthauxiliary views because they show the object’s depth. Any auxiliary view
projected from the front view, also known as a front adjacent view, is a
depth auxiliary view.
9.5 Depth Auxiliary Views
Similarly, any auxiliary view projected from the top view, also known as a
top adjacent view, is a height auxiliary view; and any auxiliary view
projected from a side view, also known as a side adjacent view, is a width
auxiliary view.
Depth Auxiliary Views
An infinite number of auxiliary planes can be hinged perpendicular to the
frontal plane (F) of projection. Five such planes are shown in Figure 9.5a.
The horizontal plane is included to show that it is similar to the others. All
these views show the object’s depth and therefore are all depth auxiliary
views.The unfolded auxiliary planes, shown in Figure 9.5b, show how depth
dimensions are projected from the top view to all auxiliary views. The
arrows indicate the directions of sight.
The complete drawing, with the outlines of the planes of projection omitted,
is shown in Figure 9.5c. Note that the front view shows the height and the
width of the object, but not the depth. The principal dimension shown in an
auxiliary view is the one not shown in the adjacent view from which the
auxiliary view was projected.
Height Auxiliary Views
An infinite number of auxiliary planes can be hinged perpendicular to the
horizontal plane (H) of projection. Several are shown in Figure 9.6a. The
front view and all these auxiliary views show the height of the object.
Therefore, all these auxiliary views are height auxiliary views.
9.6 Height Auxiliary ViewsThe unfolded projection planes are shown in Figure 9.6b, and the complete
drawing is shown in Figure 9.6c. Note that in the top view, the only
dimension not shown is height.
Width Auxiliary Views
An infinite number of auxiliary planes can also be hinged perpendicular to
the profile plane (P) of projection. Some are shown in Figure 9.7. The front
view and all these auxiliary views are width auxiliary views.
9.7 Width Auxiliary Views
The unfolded planes are shown in Figure 9.7b, and the complete drawing is
shown in Figure 9.7c. In the right-side view, from which the auxiliary views
are projected, the only dimension not shown is width.
Successive Auxiliary ViewsPrimary auxiliary views are projected from one of the principal views. In
Figure 9.8, auxiliary view 1 is a primary auxiliary view projected from the
top view.
9.8 Successive Auxiliary Views
From primary auxiliary view 1 a secondary auxiliary view 2 can be drawn,
then from it a third auxiliary view 3, and so on. An infinite number of such
successive auxiliary views may be drawn. However, secondary auxiliary
view 2 is not the only one that can be projected from primary auxiliary view
1. As shown by the arrows around view 1, an infinite number of secondary
auxiliary views, with different lines of sight, may be projected. Any
auxiliary view projected from a primary auxiliary view is a secondary
auxiliary view. Furthermore, any succeeding auxiliary view may be used to
project an infinite series of views from it.
In this example, folding lines are more convenient than reference-plane
lines. In auxiliary view 1, all numbered points of the object are the same
distance from folding line H/V1
 as they are in the front view from foldingline H/F. These distances, such as distance a, are transferred from the front
view to the auxiliary view.
To draw the secondary auxiliary view 2, ignore the front view and focus on
the sequence of three views: the top view, view 1, and view 2. Draw light
projection lines parallel to the direction of sight desired for view 2. Draw
folding line V1/V2 perpendicular to the projection lines and at any
convenient distance from view 1. Transfer the distances measured from
folding line H/V1
 to locate all points in view 2. For example, transfer
distance b to locate points 4 and 5 from folding line V1/V2. Connect points
to draw the object and determine visibility. The closest corner (11) in view
2 will be visible, and the one farthest away (1) will be hidden, as shown.
To draw views 3, 4, and so on, use a similar process. Remember to use the
correct sequence of three views.
Secondary Auxiliary Views
A secondary auxiliary view is projected from a primary auxiliary view onto
a plane that is inclined to all three principal projection planes. As shown in
Figure 9.9, a part that has an oblique surface often requires a second
auxiliary view to show that surface’s true size and shape. In this case, the
primary auxiliary view shows the oblique plane on edge.9.9 Second Auxiliary View, Showing the True Size of the Top Oblique Surface
Reference Planes
In the auxiliary view shown in Figure 9.10c, the folding line represents the
edge view of the frontal plane of projection. In this case, the frontal plane is
used for transferring distances—that is, depth measurements—from the top
view to the auxiliary view.9.10 An Auxiliary View
Instead of using one of the planes of projection, you can use a reference
plane parallel to the plane of projection that touches or cuts through the
object. For example, in Figure 9.11a, a reference plane is aligned with the
front surface of the object. This plane appears on edge, as a line, in the top
and auxiliary views. Measurements are made from the reference lines. The
depth dimensions in the top view and auxiliary views are equal. The
advantage of the reference-plane method is that fewer measurements are
required, because some points of the object lie in the reference plane. Make
the reference plane using light lines similar to construction lines.9.11 Position of the Reference Plane
You can use a reference plane that coincides with the front surface of the
object, as shown in Figure 9.11a. When an object is symmetrical, it is useful
to select the reference plane to cut through the object, as shown in Figure
9.11b. This way you have to make only half as many measurements to
transfer dimensions because they are the same on each side of the reference
plane. You can also use the back surface of the object, as shown in Figure
9.11c, or any intermediate point that would be advantageous.
Tip
If you are using 2D CAD, you can draw half of the view and then mirror
the object.
Position the reference plane so it is convenient for transferring distances.
Remember the following:1. Reference lines, like folding lines, are always at right angles to the
projection lines between the views.
2. A reference plane appears as a line in two alternate views, never in
adjacent views.
3. Measurements are always made at right angles to the reference lines or
parallel to the projection lines.
4. In the auxiliary view, all points are at the same distances from the
reference line as the corresponding points are from the reference line in
the alternate view, or the second previous view.
Step by Step
Projecting an Auxiliary ViewThe object has been numbered in the pictorial view to aid in keeping track
of the vertices. To create an auxiliary view of surface A, follow these steps.
Draw two views of the object and determine the direction of sight
needed to produce a view that will show the true size of surface A.Next, sketch projection lines parallel to the direction of sight.
Establish a reference plane. In this case the back surface of the object will
work well. The reference lines in the top and auxiliary views are at right
angles to the projection lines. These are the edge views of the reference
plane, RP.
The auxiliary view of surface A will be true size and shape because
the direction of sight is perpendicular to that surface. Transfer depth
measurements from the top view to the auxiliary view. Each point in the
auxiliary view will be on its projection line extended from the front view.
The point will be the same distance from the reference line in the top view
to the corresponding reference line in the auxiliary view. Finish projecting
points 5 and 8.Draw surface A true size in the auxiliary view by connecting the
vertices in the same order as they are shown connecting in the top view 
(1 − 7 − 8 − 5 − 2 − 1).Complete the auxiliary view by adding other visible edges and surfaces of
the object. Each numbered point in the auxiliary view lies on its projection
line from the front view and is the same distance from the reference line as
it is in the top view. Note that two surfaces of the object appear as lines in
the auxiliary view.9.1 Using Triangles to Sketch Auxiliary Views
You can use two triangles to quickly draw parallel and perpendicular lines
for “accurate” sketches.
Place two triangles together so that the 90° corners are on the outside, as
shown in Figure 9.12.
9.12 Triangles Being Used to Help Sketch Auxiliary Views
Slide them on your drawing until the outer edge of one triangle is along
the line to which you want to sketch parallel.
Hold down the triangle and slide the other along it.
Draw parallel lines along one edge of the triangle. Draw perpendicular
lines along the other edge.This technique works well as an addition to freehand sketching when you
want to show an auxiliary view.
9.2 Using Grid Paper to Sketch Auxiliary Views
You can use grid paper to help sketch auxiliary views by orienting the lines
of the grid paper underneath your vellum or other semitransparent drawing
sheet so that the grid is parallel to the inclined edge in the drawing, as
shown in Figure 9.13. Use the grid to help sketch lines parallel and
perpendicular to the edge in question.
9.13 Sketching Auxiliary Views Using Grid Paper
Step by Step
Showing an Inclined Elliptical Surface True SizeGiven the front and side views shown, use these steps to project an
auxiliary view showing the true size of the elliptical surface.
Because this is a symmetrical object, use a reference plane through
the center of the object, as shown.
Select points on the circle in the side view.Locate the same points on the inclined surface and the left-end
surface.
Given Views
Project each point to the auxiliary view along its projection line. In
this case, the direction of sight is perpendicular to the edge view of the
inclined surface. This will produce an auxiliary view showing the true
shape of that surface.Transfer distances from the side view to the auxiliary view. Because
the object is symmetrical, two points can be located with each
measurement, as shown for points 1–2, 3–4, and 5–6. Project enough points
to sketch the curves accurately.Because the major and minor axes are known, you can quickly create
similar ellipses using CAD by locating the major and minor axes or the
center and axes. For hand sketching, you may want to use an ellipse
template.
9.3 Using CAD to Create Auxiliary Views
Most CAD systems allow you to rotate the grid or to create a new
coordinate system (often called a user coordinate system) so that it aligns
with the inclined surface. If you are using 3D CAD, you can create true-size
auxiliary views by viewing the object perpendicular to the surface you want
to show true size (see Figure 9.14).9.14 CAD software provides tools for generating auxiliary views. (Courtesy of SolidWorks Corporation.)
9.4 Circles and Ellipses in Auxiliary Views
Circular shapes appear elliptical when viewed at an angle other than 90°
(straight on to the circular shape). This is frequently the case when
constructing auxiliary views (Figure 9.15).
9.15 Circles Projected as Ellipses in Auxiliary Views
9.5 Hidden Lines in Auxiliary Views
Generally, hidden lines should be omitted in auxiliary views, unless they are
needed to clearly communicate the drawing’s intent. Note the use of hidden
lines in Figure 9.16.9.16 Omit hidden lines from auxiliary views whenever possible.
Tip
Your instructor may ask you to show all hidden lines for visualization
practice, especially if the auxiliary view of the entire object is shown.
Later, when you are familiar with drawing auxiliary views, omit hidden
lines when they do not add needed information to the drawing.
Step by Step
Plotting Curves Manually in an Auxiliary ViewUse the following steps to manually create an auxiliary view that shows the
true size and shape of an inclined cut through a piece of molding. The
method of plotting points is similar to that explained for the ellipse.
Identify some points along the curve shown in the side view. Locate
those same points in the front view.
Locate the reference plane. Draw projectors perpendicular to the
inclined surface in the front view and project the points into the auxiliary
view.Finish projecting all of the points on the inclined surface and draw its
true shape in the auxiliary view.9.6 Partial Auxiliary Views
Using an auxiliary view often makes it possible to omit one or more regular
views, but auxiliary drawings are time consuming to create and may even
be confusing because of the clutter of lines.
Partial views are often sufficient and easier to read. Figure 9.17 shows
partial regular views and partial auxiliary views. Usually, a break line is
used to indicate the imaginary break in the views. Do not draw a break line
coinciding with a visible line or hidden line.So that partial auxiliary views (which are often small) do not appear “lost”
and unrelated to any view, connect them to the views from which they
project, either with a centerline or with one or two thin projection lines as
shown in Figure 9.17.
9.17 Partial Views
9.7 Half Auxiliary Views
If an auxiliary view is symmetrical, and if it is necessary to save space on
the drawing or to save time, a half auxiliary view may be drawn, as shown
in Figure 9.18. In this case, half of a regular view is also shown, since the
bottom flange is also symmetrical. Note that in each case the near half is
shown.9.18 Half Views
9.8 Reverse Construction
To complete the regular views, it is often necessary to first construct an
auxiliary view where critical dimensions will be shown true size. For
example, in Figure 9.19a, the upper part of the right-side view cannot be
constructed until the auxiliary view is drawn. First, points are established on
the curves and then projected back to the front view.9.19 Reverse Construction
In Figure 9.19b, the 60° angle and the location of line 1–2 in the front view
are given. To locate line 3–4 in the front view and lines 2–4, 3–4, and 4–5
in the side view, you must first construct the 60° angle in the auxiliary view
and project it back to the front and side views, as shown.
9.9 Auxiliary Sections
An auxiliary section is simply an auxiliary view in section (see Figure
9.20). A typical auxiliary section is shown in Figure 9.22. In this example,
there is not sufficient space for a revolved section, although a removed
section could have been used instead of an auxiliary section. Note the
cutting-plane line and the terminating arrows that indicate the direction of
sight for the auxiliary section. In an auxiliary section drawing, the entire
portion of the object behind the cutting plane may be shown, or the cut
surface alone may be shown.9.20 Auxiliary SectionsThe cutting-plane line indicates both the location of the cutting plane and
the direction of sight for the auxiliary section. Figures 9.21 and 9.22 show
examples of this. Notice that the auxiliary section is shown in alignment.
Typically, a centerline is extended to locate the auxiliary sections or a few
projection lines are shown in the drawing for this purpose.
9.21 Secondary Auxiliary View—Partial Views9.22 Auxiliary Section
9.10 Viewing-Plane Lines and Arrows
When the drawing sheet is too crowded to show the auxiliary view in direct
projection you can use a viewing-plane line or a viewing direction arrow to
indicate the direction of sight for the auxiliary view.
A viewing-plane line and a cutting-plane line look essentially the same. The
arrows on either end of the line point in the direction of sight for the
removed view. The ends of the line are labeled with letters, starting with A,
then B, and so on. The auxiliary view, when placed in a removed location,
should still be shown in the same orientation it would have if it were
aligned in projection. Figure 9.23a shows a removed auxiliary view and
viewing-plane line.9.23 Using a Viewing-Plane Line to Show the Direction of Sight for an Auxiliary View.
Alternatively, a centerline can be extended to indicate the viewing direction.
A viewing direction arrow for a removed auxiliary view is essentially the
same as for any other removed view. Show an arrow pointing in the
direction of sight for the removed auxiliary view. Label the removed view
and place it in the same orientation it would have when projected, or if it is
rotated, show a rotation arrow and specify the amount of rotation.
A centerline can be extended from a hole or other symmetric feature to
indicate the alignment of the auxiliary view, as shown in Figure 9.23b.
Viewing direction arrows are particularly useful when showing a second
auxiliary view in a drawing that is created from a 3D CAD model. Often,
the primary auxiliary view is not necessary and can be left out if a viewing
direction arrow is shown indicating the direction of sight for the second
auxiliary view. An example of this use of a viewing direction arrow in a
CAD drawing is shown in Figure 9.24.9.24 Using a Viewing Direction Arrow to Show the Direction of Sight for an Auxiliary View
9.11 Uses of Auxiliary Views
Generally, auxiliary views are used to show the true shape or true angle of
features that appear distorted in the regular views. Auxiliary views are often
used to produce views that show the following:
1. True length of line
2. Point view of line
3. Edge view of plane
4. True size of plane
You can use the ability to generate views that show the specific items listed
to solve a variety of engineering problems. Descriptive geometry is the term
for using accurate drawings to solve engineering problems. An accurate
CAD drawing database can be used to solve many engineering problems
when you understand the four basic views from descriptive geometry. Using
3D CAD, you can often model objects accurately and query the database for
lengths and angles. Even so, you will often need the techniques describednext to produce views that will help you visualize, create, or display 3D
drawing geometry.
9.12 True Length of a Line
As shown in Figure 9.25, a line will show true length in a plane of
projection that is parallel to the line. In other words, a line will show true
length in an auxiliary view where the direction of sight is perpendicular to
the line. To show a line true length, make the fold line parallel to the line
you want to show true length in the auxiliary view. Whenever a line is
parallel to the fold line between two views, it will be true length in the
adjacent view.9.25 True Length of a LineTip
The Need to Show the True Length of a Line in CAD
The slope of a guy wire can be determined when you see its true length. Foreshortened views do not
show the actual angle.
Whether you are using 2D or 3D CAD or creating a sketch or drawing by
hand, it is often necessary to create a view that shows a certain line true
length. For example, a line must appear true length if you want to find its
slope.
When you are working in a 3D CAD program, it is generally easy to list
the true length of a line or an edge; but knowing the dimension is not the
same as being able to show it on a drawing so that others can correctly
interpret it.To annotate the dimension on a drawing view where the line in question is
shown true length you must understand how to create a view that is parallel
to the line.
If you use 2D CAD, you will use the same methods explained in this
chapter. If you use 3D CAD, reading about how to show a line at true
length will help you understand how to create a plane parallel to that line in
3D CAD.
Understanding when a line is true length and when it is foreshortened in a
view is also helpful in developing your ability to accurately visualize a 3D
object from a 2D drawing.

Choose the direction of sight to be perpendicular to line 1–2 (front
view).Draw the H/F folding line between the top and front views, as shown.
Draw the F/V1 folding line parallel to line 1–2 and any convenient
distance from line 1–2 (front view).Draw projection lines from points 1, 2, and 3 to begin creating the
auxiliary view.Transfer points 1 and 2 to the auxiliary view at the same distance from
the folding line as they are in the top view, and along their respective
projection lines. The hip rafter (line 1–2) is shown true length in the
auxiliary view.
Also, triangle 1–2–3 in the auxiliary view shows the true size and shape of
that portion of the roof because the direction of sight for the auxiliary view
is perpendicular to triangle 1–2–3.
9.13 Point View of a Line
As shown in Figure 9.26, a line will show as a point view when projected to
a plane perpendicular it. To show the point view of a line, choose the
direction of sight parallel to the line where it is true length.9.26 Point View of a Line
Showing the Point View of a Line
Refer to Figure 9.27 for the following steps:9.27 Point View of a Line1. Choose the direction of sight to be parallel to line 1–2x.
2. Draw folding line H/F between the top and front views, as shown.
3. Draw folding line F/A perpendicular to line 1–2 where it is true length,
and any convenient distance from line 1–2 (front view).
4. Draw projection lines from points 1 and 2 to begin creating the auxiliary
view.
5. Transfer points 1 and 2 to the auxiliary view at the same distance from
the folding line as they are in the top view and along their respective
projection lines. They will line up exactly with each other to form a point
view of the line.
Tip
Viewing a Line as a Point
Draw a line in a plane—for example, a straight line on a sheet of paper.
Then, tilt the paper to view the line as a point. You will see that when the
line appears as a point, the plane containing it appears as a line. (Because
your paper will end up being viewed on edge, it may be a little hard to see
the line when it is oriented correctly.)9.14 Edge View of a Plane
As shown in Figure 9.28, a plane will show on edge in a plane of projection
that shows a point view of any line that lies entirely within the plane. To get
the point view of a line, the direction of sight must be parallel to the linewhere it is true length. To show the edge view of a plane, choose the
direction of sight parallel to a true-length line lying in the plane.
9.28 Edge View of a Surface
Finding the edge view of a plane is a useful tool for the following types of
problems:
Finding the shortest line from a point to a plane. The shortest line will be
perpendicular from the point to the plane. This is easiest to show in a
view showing the plane on edge.
Finding the slope of a plane. When you are working in a 3D CAD
program, it is easy to create a view from any direction. Understanding
how to choose a direction that will produce the most useful view for
your purposes is easier yet when you understand these basic principles.Even though you can use CAD inquiry tools to quickly determine the
angle between planes, often you may need to document the angle of a
plane in a view showing the plane on edge.
Showing the Edge View of a Plane
Refer to Figure 9.29 for the following steps:9.29 Edge View of a Plane1. Choose the direction of sight to be parallel to line 1–2 in the front view
where it is already shown true length.
2. Draw folding line H/F between the top and front views, as shown.
3. Draw folding line F/A perpendicular to true-length line 1–2 and any
convenient distance.
4. Draw projection lines from points 1, 2, and 3 to begin creating the
auxiliary view.
5. Transfer points 1, 2, and 3 to the auxiliary view at the same distance
from the folding line as they are in the top view and along their
respective projection lines. Plane 1–2–3 will appear on edge in the
finished drawing.
9.15 True Size of an Oblique Surface
As shown in Figure 9.30, a plane will show true size when the plane of
projection is parallel to it.9.30 True Size of an Oblique Surface
To show the true size view of a plane, choose the direction of sight
perpendicular to the edge view of the plane.
Showing the true size of a surface continues from the method presented for
showing inclined surfaces true size, where the edge view is already given.
But to show an oblique surface true size, you need first to show the oblique
surface on edge and then construct a second auxiliary view to show it true
size.
Showing the True Size and Shape of an Oblique Surface
To show the true size and shape of an oblique surface, such as surface 1–2–
3 in Figure 9.31, create a second auxiliary view. In this example foldinglines are used, but you can achieve the same results for all of the preceding
examples using reference lines.9.31 True-Size View of an Oblique Surface
1. Draw the auxiliary view showing surface 1–2–3 on edge, as explained
previously.
2. Create a second auxiliary view with the line of sight perpendicular to the
edge view of plane 1–2–3 in the primary auxiliary view. Project lines
parallel to the arrow. Draw folding line A1/A2 perpendicular to these
projection lines at a convenient distance from the primary auxiliary view.
3. Draw the secondary auxiliary view. Transfer the distance to each point
from folding line F/A1
 to the second auxiliary view—for example,
dimensions d1, d2, and d3. The true size TS of the surface 1–2–3 is
shown in the secondary auxiliary view, because the direction of sight is
perpendicular to it.
Figure 9.32 shows an example of the steps to find the true size of an oblique
surface. The first step, illustrated in Figure 9.32a, shows the oblique surface
on edge. Figure 9.32b establishes the direction of sight perpendicular to the
edge view. The final true size view of the surface is projected in Figure
9.32c.9.32 True Size of Oblique Surface—Folding Line Method
Figure 9.33 shows a similar example using the reference-plane method.9.33 True Size of an Oblique Surface—Reference-Plane Method
9.16 Dihedral Angles
The angle between two planes is called a dihedral angle. Auxiliary views
often need to be drawn to show dihedral angles true size, mainly for
dimensioning purposes. In Figure 9.34a, a block with a V-groove is shown
where the dihedral angle between inclined surfaces A and B is shown true
size in the front view.9.34 Dihedral Angles
In Figure 9.34b, the V-groove on the block is at an angle to the front surface
so that the true dihedral angle is not shown. Assume that the actual angle is
the same as in Figure 9.34a. Does the angle appear larger or smaller than in
Figure 9.34a?
To show the true dihedral angle, the line of intersection (in this case 1–2)
must appear as a point. Because the line of intersection for the dihedral
angle is in both planes, showing it as a point will produce a view which
shows both planes on edge. This will give you the true-size view of the
dihedral angle.
In Figure 9.34a, line 1–2 is the line of intersection of planes A and B. Now,
line 1–2 lies in both planes at the same time; therefore, a point view of this
line will show both planes as lines, and the angle between them is the
dihedral angle between the planes. To get the true angle between two
planes, find the point view of the line of intersection of the planes.In Figure 9.34c, the direction of sight is parallel to line 1–2 so that line 1–2
appears as a point, planes A and B appear as lines, and the true dihedral
angle is shown in the auxiliary view.
Figure 9.35 shows a drawing using an auxiliary view to show the true angle
between surfaces.
9.35 Using an Auxiliary View to Show the True Angle between Surfaces (Dihedral Angle)
Understanding Developments and Intersections
A development is a flat representation or pattern that when folded together
creates a 3D object (Figure 9.36). An intersection is the result of two
objects that intersect each other (Figure 9.37). Sheet metal construction is
the most common application for developments and intersections. Adevelopment of surfaces, such as those found in sheet metal fabrication, is a
flat pattern that represents the unfolded or unrolled surface of the form. The
resulting flat pattern gives the true size of each connected area of the form
so that the part or structure can be fabricated. Auxiliary views are a primary
tool for creating developments, but many specialized software packages are
available to automate creating developments and intersections. You can also
apply what you have learned about auxiliary views to create developments
and intersections using your CAD system.

9.37 Intersecting Prisms
Surface TerminologyThe following terminology describes objects and concepts used in
developments and intersections:
A ruled surface is one that may be generated by sweeping a straight line,
called the generatrix, along a path, which may be straight or curved (Figure
9.38). Any position of the generatrix is an element of the surface. A ruled
surface may be a plane, a single-curved surface, or a warped surface.
9.38 Ruled Surface
A plane is a ruled surface that is generated by a line, one point of which
moves along a straight path while the generatrix remains parallel to its
original position. Many geometric solids are bounded by plane surfaces
(Figure 9.39).9.39 Plane Surfaces
A single-curved surface is a developable ruled surface; that is, it can be
unrolled to coincide with a plane. Any two adjacent positions of the
generatrix lie in the same plane. Examples are the cylinder (Figure 9.40)
and the cone.
images
9.40 Single-Curved Surface
A double-curved surface is generated by a curved line and has no straight￾line elements (Figure 9.41). A surface generated by revolving a curved line
about a straight line in the plane of the curve is called a double-curved
surface of revolution. Common examples are the sphere, torus, ellipsoid,
and hyperboloid.
9.41 Double-Curved Surface
A warped surface is a ruled surface that is not developable. Some examples
are shown in Figure 9.42. No two adjacent positions of the generatrix lie in
a flat plane. Warped surfaces cannot be unrolled or unfolded to lie flat.
Many exterior surfaces on an airplane or automobile are warped surfaces.images
9.42 Warped Surfaces
Developable Surfaces
A developable surface may be unfolded or unrolled to lie flat. Surfaces
composed of single-curved surfaces, of planes, or of combinations of these
types are developable.
Warped surfaces and double-curved surfaces are not directly developable.
They may be developed by approximating their shape using developable
surfaces. If the material used in the actual manufacturing is sufficiently
pliable, the flat sheets may be stretched, pressed, stamped, spun, or
otherwise forced to assume the desired shape. Nondevelopable surfaces are
often produced by a combination of developable surfaces that are then
formed slightly to produce the required shape. Figure 9.43 shows examples
of developable surfaces.
images
9.43 Development of Surfaces
Principles of Intersections
Accurate drawings showing the intersections of planes and solids are
needed for openings in roof surfaces for flues and stacks; openings in wall
surfaces for pipes, chutes, and so on; and the building of sheet metalstructures such as tanks and boilers. In such cases, you generally need to
determine the true size and shape of the intersection of a plane and one of
the more common geometric solids. Figure 9.44 shows an example in which
you would need to determine the intersection of a solid and a plane to create
the correctly shaped opening in the vertical prism—the main flue—where
the horizontal prism joins it.
images
9.44 Intersecting Prisms
For solids bounded by plane surfaces, you need find only the points of
intersection of the edges of the solid with the plane and to join these points,
in consecutive order, with straight lines.
For solids bounded by curved surfaces, it is necessary to find the points of
intersection of several elements of the solid with the plane and to trace a
smooth curve through these points. The intersection of a plane and a
circular cone is called a conic section. Some typical conic sections are
shown in Figure 9.45.
images
9.45 Conic Sections
9.17 DevelopmentsThe development of a surface is that surface laid out on a plane. Practical
applications of developments occur in sheet metal work, stone cutting,
pattern making, packaging, and package design. See Figure 9.46.
images
9.46 Flat Pattern for a Root Beer Package (Courtesy of Kessler Brewing Co.)
Single-curved surfaces and the surfaces of polyhedra can be developed.
Developments for warped surfaces and double-curved surfaces can only be
approximated.
In sheet metal layout, extra material must be provided for laps and seams. If
the material is heavy, the thickness may be a factor, and the crowding of
metal in bends must be considered. Stock sizes must also be taken into
account and layouts made to economize on material and labor. In preparing
developments, it is best to put the seam at the shortest edge and to attach the
bases at edges where they match; this will minimize processing such as
soldering, welding, and riveting.
It is common to draw development layouts with the inside surfaces up. This
way, all fold lines and other markings are related directly to inside
measurements, which are the important dimensions in all ducts, pipes,
tanks, and vessels. In this position they are also convenient for use in the
fabricating shop. See Sections 10.6 and 11.43 for more information about
sheet metal bends.Finding the Intersection of a Plane and a Prism and Developing the
Prism
To create flat patterns for sheet metal, packaging, and other purposes, you
must first determine the true size of the surface. The true size and shape of
the intersection of a plane and a prism is shown in the auxiliary view in
Figure 9.47. The length AB is the same as AB in the front view, and the
width AD is the same as AD in the top view.
9.47 Auxiliary View Showing True Size and Shape of the Intersection of a Plane and a Prism
Step by StepDeveloping a Prism
images
These are the steps for creating the development for the prism shown here.
Draw the stretchout line, which represents the axis along which the
part is unfolded or unrolled. On the stretchout line, transfer the true sizes of
faces 1–2 and 2–3, which are shown true length in the top view. Remember
that a line appears true length when the view is perpendicular to the line. In
other words, when a line is parallel to the fold line between views, the line
is true length in the adjacent view.
images
Where two surfaces join, draw perpendiculars to the stretchout line
and transfer the true height of each respective edge. The front view shows
the true heights in this case. Project the heights from the front view, as
shown. Complete the development of these surfaces using straight lines to
join the points you have plotted. Identify other surfaces that are connected
to these and attach their true sizes to the development of the lower base and
the upper base. Use an auxiliary view to find the true size of the surface and
then draw it in place.images
When you finish, you will have drawn the development of the entire
prism, as shown. If needed, add tabs so that there is material to connect the
surfaces when folded up.
images
Finding the Intersection of a Plane and a Cylinder and Developing the
Cylinder
The intersection of a plane and a cylinder is an ellipse whose true size is
shown in the auxiliary view of Figure 9.48. The steps for developing a
cylinder are as follows:9.48 Plane and Cylinder
Draw elements of the cylinder. It is usually best to divide the base of the
cylinder into equal parts, shown in the top view and then projected into
the front view.
In the auxiliary view, the widths BC, DE, and so on, are transferred from
the top view at 2–16, 3–15, respectively, and the ellipse is drawn through
these points. The major axis AH shows true length in the front view, and
the minor axis JK shows true length in the top view. You can use this
information to quickly draw the ellipse using CAD.Draw the stretchout line for the cylinder. It will be equal to the
circumference of the base, whose length is determined by the formula
πd.
Divide the stretchout line into the same number of equal parts as the
circumference of the base, and draw an element through each division
perpendicular to the line.
Transfer the true height by projecting it from the front view, as shown in
Figure 9.48b.
Draw a smooth curve through the points A, B, D, and so on.
Draw the tangent lines and attach the bases as shown in Figure 9.48b.
9.18 Hems and Joints for Sheet Metal and Other Materials
Figure 9.49 shows a wide variety of hems and joints used in fabricating
sheet metal parts and other items. Hems are used to eliminate the raw edge
as well as to stiffen the material. Joints and seams may be made for sheet
metal by bending, welding, riveting, and soldering and for package
materials by gluing and stapling.
images
9.49 Sheet Metal Hems and Joints
You must add material for hems and joints to the layout or development.
The amount you add depends on the thickness of the material and the
production equipment. A good place to find more information is frommanufacturers. They can be extremely helpful in identifying specifications
related to the exact process that will be used to make the part.
9.19 More Examples of Developments and Intersections
Developing a Plane and an Oblique Prism
The intersection of a plane and an oblique prism is shown in Figure 9.50a.
Where the plane is normal to the prism formed by plane WX (called a right
section) it appears as a regular hexagon, as shown in the auxiliary view
labeled “Right section.” The oblique section cut by horizontal plane YZ is
shown true size in the top view.
images
9.50 Plane and Oblique Prism
The development for this oblique prism is shown in Figure 9.50b. Use the
right section to create stretchout line WX. On the stretchout line, set off the
true widths of the faces 1–2, 2–3, and so on, which are shown true size in
the auxiliary view. Draw perpendiculars through each division. Transfer the
true heights of the respective edges, which are shown true size in the front
view. Join the points A, B, C, and so on with straight lines. Finally, attach
the bases, which are shown in their true sizes in the top view, along an edge.
Developing a Plane and an Oblique CylinderThe development of the intersection of a plane and an oblique cylinder is
similar to that for a plane and an oblique prism, as shown in Figure 9.51.
images
9.51 Plane and Oblique Circular Cylinder
Developing a Plane and a Pyramid
The intersection of a plane and a pyramid is a trapezoid, as shown in Figure
9.52.
images
9.52 Plane and Pyramid
Developing a Plane and a Cone
The intersection of a plane and a cone is an ellipse, as shown in Figure 9.53.
If a series of horizontal cutting planes are passed perpendicular to the axis,
each plane will cut a circle from the cone that will show as true size and
shape in the top view. Points in which these circles intersect the original
cutting plane are points on the ellipse. Because the cutting plane is shown
on edge in the front view (Figure 9.53a), all these piercing points can be
projected from there to the others, as shown in Figure 9.53b.
images
9.53 Plane and ConeTo develop the lateral surface of a cone, think of the cone as a pyramid
having an infinite number of edges. The development is similar to that for a
pyramid.
Developing a Hood and Flue
The development of a hood and flue is shown in Figure 9.54. Because the
hood is a conical surface, it may be developed as shown in Figure 9.53. The
two end sections of the elbow are cylindrical surfaces. The two middle
sections of the elbow are cylindrical surfaces, but their bases are not
perpendicular to the axes, so they will not develop into straight lines.
images
9.54 A Hood and Flue
Develop them similar to an oblique cylinder. Make auxiliary planes AB and
DC perpendicular to the axes so they cut right sections from the cylinders,
which will develop into the straight lines AB and CD in the developments.
Arranging the developments as shown allows the elbow to be constructed
from a rectangular sheet of metal without wasting material. The patterns are
shown in the right top portion of Figure 9.54 as they will be separated after
cutting.
9.20 Transition PiecesA transition piece is one that connects two different-shaped, different￾sized, or skewed position openings. In most cases, transition pieces are
composed of plane surfaces and conical surfaces, as shown in Figure 9.55.
You will learn about developing conical surfaces by triangulation next.
Triangulation can also be used to develop, approximately, certain warped
surfaces. Transition pieces are used extensively in air conditioning, heating,
ventilating, and similar construction.
images
9.55 Transition Pieces
Ductwork Parts
images
Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems often use
ductwork to transfer air through the system. The standard parts shown
above are made of 26 gauge galvanized steel and can be purchased “off the
shelf.” When ducts must connect at odd angles to fit into existing spaces,
custom designed developments and intersections are required.
9.21 TriangulationTriangulation is simply a method of dividing a surface into a number of
triangles and transferring them to the development. To find the development
of an oblique cone by triangulation, divide the base of the cone in the top
view into any number of equal parts and draw an element at each division
point, as shown in Figure 9.56. Find the true length of each element. If the
divisions of the base are comparatively small, the lengths of the chords may
be used in the development to represent the lengths of the respective arcs.
Because the development is symmetrical, it is necessary to lay out only half
the development, as shown at the right side of Figure 9.56.
images
9.56 Development of an Oblique Cone by Triangulation
9.22 Developing a Transition Piece Connecting Rectangular
Pipes on the Same Axis
The transition piece can be a frustum of a pyramid that connects rectangular
pipes on the same axis, as shown in Figure 9.57. As a check on the
development, lines parallel on the surface must also be parallel on the
development.
images
9.57 Development of a Transition Piece—Connecting Rectangular Pipes on the Same Axis
9.23 Developing a Plane and a SphereThe intersection of a plane and a sphere is a circle. The diameter of the
circle depends on where the plane is located. Any circle cut by a plane
through the center of the sphere is called a great circle. If a plane passes
through the center and is perpendicular to the axis, the resulting great circle
is called the equator. If a plane contains the axis, it will cut a great circle
called a meridian.
The surface of a sphere is double curved and is not developable, but it may
be developed approximately by dividing it into a series of zones and
substituting a portion of a right-circular cone for each zone. If the conical
surfaces are inscribed within the sphere, the development will be smaller
than the spherical surface, but if they are circumscribed about the sphere,
the development will be larger. If the conical surfaces are partly inside and
partly outside the sphere, the resulting development is closely approximate
to the spherical surface. This method of developing a spherical surface, the
polyconic method, is shown in Figure 9.58a. It is used on government maps
of the United States.
images
9.58 Approximate Development of a Sphere
Another method of making an approximate development of the double￾curved surface of a sphere is to divide the surface into equal sections with
meridian planes and substitute cylindrical surfaces for the spherical
sections. The cylindrical surfaces may be inscribed within the sphere,circumscribed about it, or located partly inside and partially outside. This
method, the polycylindric method (sometimes called the gore method) is
shown in Figure 9.58b.
images
9.59 Auxiliary View and Revolution Compared
9.24 Revolution
Revolution, like auxiliary view projection, is a method of determining the
true length and true size of inclined and oblique lines and planes. To create
the auxiliary view, imagine that the object remains stationary and a new
viewing plane is added as shown by the arrow in Figure 9.59a. Surface A
shows true size and shape in the auxiliary view.
The same view of the object can be obtained by moving the object with
respect to the viewing planes, as shown in Figure 9.59b. Here the object is
revolved until surface A appears in its true size and shape in the right-side
view. Revolution determines true length and true size without creating
another view. Instead, revolution positions an object in space to create
standard views that show the true size and shape of the inclined or oblique
surface.
Axis of RevolutionImagine the axis of revolution to be perpendicular to the front plane of
projection in Figure 9.59b. The axis of revolution appears as a point in this
view. The object revolves but does not change shape in this view. In the
adjacent views in which the axis of revolution, if it were drawn, would
show as a line in true length, the dimensions of the object that are parallel to
the axis of revolution do not change. Other dimensions may appear
foreshortened.
Creating a Revolved Drawing
To make a drawing using revolution to show the true size of a surface, use
the following procedure:
1. Select the view that has the feature of interest, such as the inclined
surface showing as an edge, that you want to revolve to produce a true￾size feature in the adjacent view.
2. Select any point at any convenient position on or outside that view about
which to draw the view revolved either clockwise or counterclockwise.
That point is the end view, or point view, of the axis of revolution.
3. Draw this first view on the plane of projection. This is the only view that
remains unchanged in size and shape.
4. Project the other views from this view using standard orthographic
projection techniques.
9.25 Primary and Successive RevolutionsThe axis of revolution is usually perpendicular to one of the three principal
planes of projection. A primary revolution is one in which the object is
revolved about an axis perpendicular to the horizontal, frontal, or profile
planes of projection. Successive revolutions are drawings that use multiple
revolutions of the same object to produce a final revolved drawing with the
desired result. Figure 9.60 shows an example. As you can imagine, this is
accomplished in one step using CAD.
images
9.60 Successive Revolutions of a Prism
9.26 True Length of a Line: Revolution Method
A line (edge) appears true length when it is parallel to one of the planes of
projection. In Figure 9.61a, line AB (an element of the cone) is oblique to
the planes of projection. Line AB appears foreshortened, not true length. If
AB is revolved about the axis of the cone until it coincides with either of the
contour elements (for example, ABR), it will be shown in its true length in
the front view because it will then be parallel to the front plane of
projection.
images
9.61 True Length of a Line—Revolution MethodIn Figure 9.61b, to show the edge of the pyramid CD true length, it is
revolved about the axis of the pyramid until it is parallel to the frontal plane
of projection and therefore shows true length in the front view. In Figure
9.61c, line EF is shown true length in the front view because it has been
revolved about a vertical axis until it is parallel to the front plane of
projection.
The true length of a line may also be found by constructing a right triangle
or a true-length diagram (Figure 9.61d) with the base of the triangle equal
to the top view of the line, for example, the distance from E to F in the top
view in c, drawn as XF in d; and the height of the triangle equal to the
projected height, XE, of the line taken from the front view. The hypotenuse
of the triangle is equal to the true length of the line.
Cad at Work
Creating Auxiliary Views Using 3D CAD
3D CAD can be used to generate any view in one or two steps, eliminating
the need to project auxiliary views and revolve views manually. It is still
very important to have a clear understanding of which line of sight will
produce a true-size view or a view that shows a true dihedral angle. When a
view from a CAD screen is measured or dimensioned, if the surface or
angle is not true size, the automatic dimension from the CAD system may
be that of the apparent, or projected, distance. Incorrectly dimensioneddihedral angles can be an error in CAD drawings created by inexperienced
operators. Drawings should show angles true size where they are
dimensioned or note it clearly if this is not the case.
Solid modeling techniques can be used to create accurate intersections
between various solids. Some CAD programs have commands for creating
transition pieces that blend solids of two differing shapes, for example, a
sweep/join operation. Not all CAD software is capable of producing
developments (flat patterns) of surfaces. Some surfaces, such as spheres or
tori, can only be approximated by a flattened shape.

Chapter Summary
An auxiliary view can be used to create a projection that shows the true
length of a line or true size of a plane.
An auxiliary view can be directly produced using CAD if the original
object was drawn as a 3D model.
Folding lines or reference lines represent the edge views of projection
planes.
Points are projected between views parallel to the line of sight and
perpendicular to the reference lines or folding lines.
A common use of auxiliary views is to show dihedral angles true size.
Curves are projected to auxiliary views by plotting them as points.A secondary auxiliary view can be constructed from a previously drawn
(primary) auxiliary view.
The technique for creating the development of a solid is determined by
the basic geometric shape. Prisms, pyramids, cylinders, and cones have
their own particular development techniques.
The intersection of two solids is determined by plotting the intersection
of each surface and transferring the intersection points to each
development.
Cones and pyramids use radial development. Prisms and cylinders use
parallel development.
Truncated solids, cones, and pyramids are created by developing the
whole solid and then plotting the truncated endpoints on each radial
element.
Transition pieces are developed by creating triangular surfaces that
approximate the transition from rectangular to circular. The smaller the
triangular surfaces, the more accurate the development.
Revolution moves an object in space, to reveal what would normally be
an auxiliary view of the object in a primary view (top, front, right side).
The main purpose of revolution is to reveal the true length and true size

Overview
Look at the objects around you: your pen, watch, phone, chair, and light
fixtures. All of these things have been transformed from various rawmaterials and assembled into the items you see. Some items, such as plastic
coat hangers, forks, nails, bolts, and metal brackets are made of a single
part. However, most objects are assembled from several parts made from
different materials.
Assembly modeling shows how parts fit and function in the final product.
Considering the design intent of the entire assembly makes it easier to work
with others concurrently and to model complex and ever changing designs
effectively.
An understanding of basic manufacturing processes helps you design
affordable products. Communicate with the manufacturing team early in the
design process and work together to ensure your models and drawings
provide the necessary information.
Tools such as spreadsheets, equation solvers, motion simulation, and finite
element software allow you to use model data to check for fit and
interference issues, perform tolerance studies, perform failure and vibration
analysis, determine stress concentrations, deflections, shear forces, bending
moments, heat transfer properties, and natural frequencies, and make many
other calculations. Parts can be checked at a range of sizes to see if they
interfere with others in the assembly. Test results feed back into model
changes, and the revised model is used for further testing.Rapid prototyping allows you to create physical parts to test the fit, feel,
and function of parts, or even produce usable parts through rapid
manufacturing.
Design for Manufacture, Assembly, Disassembly, and Service
Design and manufacturing are interrelated, not separate, activities. Each
part or component of a product must be designed so that it meets design
requirements and specifications, and can be manufactured economically and
efficiently. This improves productivity and allows a manufacturer to remain
competitive.
This area is termed design for manufacture (DFM). DFM is a
comprehensive approach to producing goods that integrates the design
process with materials, manufacturing methods, process planning,
assembly, testing, and quality assurance. Effectively implementing DFM
requires a fundamental understanding of the characteristics, capabilities,
and limitations of materials, manufacturing processes, and related
operations, machinery, and equipment. This includes such considerations as
variability in machine performance, dimensional accuracy and surface
finish of the workpiece, processing time, and the effect of processing
method on part quality.
You must be able to assess the impact of design modifications on
manufacturing process selection, assembly, inspection, tools and dies, andproduct cost. Establishing quantitative relationships is essential for
optimizing the design for ease of manufacturing and assembly at minimum
product cost (also called producibility). Computer-aided design,
engineering, manufacturing, and process planning techniques, using
powerful computer programs, allow such analysis. Expert systems provide
capabilities to expedite the traditional iterative process in design
optimization.
After individual parts have been manufactured, they have to be assembled
into a product. Assembly is an important phase of the overall manufacturing
operation and requires consideration of the ease, speed, and cost of putting
parts together. Also, many products must be designed so that disassembly is
possible, enabling the products to be taken apart for maintenance, servicing,
or recycling of their components. Because assembly operations can
contribute significantly to product cost, design for assembly (DFA) as well
as design for disassembly are now recognized as important aspects of
manufacturing. Typically, a product that is easy to assemble is also easy to
disassemble. Design for service, ensuring that individual parts or
subassemblies in a product are easy to reach and service, is another piece of
the puzzle.(Copyright Dmitry Kalinovsky/Shutterstock.)
Methodologies and computer software (CAD) for DFA utilize 3D
conceptual designs and solid models. In this way, subassembly and
assembly times and costs are minimized while maintaining product integrity
and performance; the system also improves the product’s ease of
disassembly. Combining design for manufacture and design for assembly
into the more comprehensive design for manufacture and assembly
(DFMA) recognizes the inherent interrelationships between design and
manufacturing.There are several methods of assembly, such as using fasteners or adhesive,
or by welding, soldering, and brazing, each with its own characteristics and
requiring different operations. The use of a bolt and nut, for example,
requires preparation of holes that must match in location and size. Hole
generation requires operations such as drilling or punching, which take
additional time, require separate operations, and produce scrap. In contrast,
products assembled with bolts and nuts can be taken apart and reassembled
with relative ease.
Parts can also be assembled with adhesives. This method, which is being
used extensively in aircraft and automobile production, does not require
holes. However, surfaces to be assembled must match properly and be
clean, because joint strength is adversely affected by the presence of
contaminants such as dirt, dust, oil, and moisture. Unlike mechanically
fastened parts, adhesively joined components, as well as those that are
welded, are not usually designed to be taken apart and reassembled, hence
are not suitable for the important purposes of recycling individual parts of
the product.
Parts may be assembled by hand or by automatic equipment and robots. The
choice depends on factors such as the complexity of the product, the
number of parts to be assembled, the protection required to prevent damage
or scratching of finished surfaces of the parts, and the relative costs of labor
and machinery required for automated assembly.Sometimes seemingly small decisions and variations in the design can add
to the cost of the part. Even a small amount per part can be important when
thousands or millions of the part will be produced. During the process of
designing a part, communicate with the people responsible for having it
manufactured and work together to produce the best design possible.
The processes used to manufacture parts may change over the production
lifetime of a part. As a device becomes more and more accepted by
consumers and production volumes increase owing to demand, it may
become cost-effective to produce the device in new ways. Molded plastics,
cast parts, machined parts, and sheet metal parts are common low-cost
production methods. Design and modeling for these types of parts will alert
you to issues you should consider and investigate as you model parts.10.1 Car Bodies Crushed for Recycling (Huguette Roe/Shutterstock)
10.1 Assembly Models
Individual part files make up a large part of the digital database for a
design. Parts within the database may be organized by levels. At the highest
level, all the parts are shown in the final assembly. (Figure 10.2 shows the
many individual parts in a coffee brewer assembly.) Within a large
assembly, subgroups may be broken out into subassemblies. Subassemblies
are groups of parts that fit together to create one functional unit, often one
that can be pre-assembled in some fashion to fit into the assembly as a unit.
Breaking a design into levels can make it easier to divide tasks among
different groups working on the same project. It can help in presenting,managing, and understanding large, complex assemblies. Some
subassemblies may even be reused in other designs as a unit.10.2 The exploded view of the Zuma coffee brewer in (a) shows the individual parts that make up
the assembly, shown assembled in (b). Each part is stored in its own part file and linked through
external references to the dynamic assembly model. (Courtesy of VKI Technologies, a division of Keurig, Canada,
Inc.)
You can combine individual parts into assemblies using your 3D CAD
software in different ways. One method is to insert copies of your solid
parts into a single assembly model. Assemblies that are created by copying
3D solid parts like these are static assemblies; that is, they do not change to
reflect alterations in the individual parts. Because there is no link
established between the part files and the assembly, if the individual parts
are changed, they must be recopied or reinserted into the assembly model to
update it. The two are completely separate, and changes made to either one
will not affect the other. In contrast, in a dynamic assembly, parts are
imported into the assembly through a linking process that allows the
software to update the assembly as individual part files are modified.
Constraint-Based AssembliesConstraint-based assemblies rely on subassembly and part files to be
available for you to view them or make changes to the assembly. If you lose
the file for a part, it will not show up in the assembly.
The associativity built into many constraint-based modelers may allow you
to make changes to parts while viewing the assembly model or to alter a
model by making changes to a drawing view. These changes update and
modify the individual part files. This two-way updating capability is
illustrated in Figure 10.3.
10.3 The links between part and assembly files are analogous to the bidirectional associativity
between model and drawing. A change made to part A in the assembly updates the part file, and vice
versa.With constraint-based modeling software, you use assembly constraints to
create the relationships between parts. The first part you add to the
assembly is the parent part. As you add parts, you specify the constraints
between the parent part and the added child part that reflect the design
intent for the assembly. Mating parts have features that should fit together
in an assembly. For example, if you want two holes to line up, you can use
an assembly constraint to align them. If a part changes, it will still be
oriented in the assembly so that the holes align.
Choosing the Parent Part
Constraint-based assemblies differ in the parent-child relationships that are
built into the model. The first part that is added to the assembly acts as the
parent part for other added parts, just as the base feature is the parent for
any other features in the part model. These parent-child relationships are
critical. If the parent is moved, the children move along with it. This can be
a great advantage: if one of the parts in the assembly moves or changes, the
child parts move to update their positions relative to it.
If you delete a part that is the parent of some other part in the assembly,
then the location of the child part is undefined. As the modeling software
tries to generate the assembly from the parts and relationships stored in the
database, undefined locations require you to redefine the placement of the
child parts and may, in the worst case, cause the file to fail to open or the
software to crash.One strategy is to use a standard set of datum planes as the first part in your
assembly so that all other parts are children of this blank part that never
changes (see Figure 10.4). Using a set of datum planes as the parent part in
the assembly also helps fix your assembly on the coordinate system.
Assemblies that are not fixed on the coordinate system may move in
undesired ways when you are later trying to animate assembly motions.
10.4 Assembly Datums. Using assembly datums and establishing logical parent-child relations are
key to assemblies that are updated easily. (Courtesy of Mark Perkins.)
When choosing the parent part to start out your assembly:Consider adding a blank set of datum planes as the first part in the
assembly, particularly if your modeler does not already start with
assembly datums. These can often be handy even for small tasks like
reorienting subassembly parts. Additional datums are rarely detrimental.
Manage the display of the datums to hide them when they are not
needed.
Start with major parts to which other parts connect.
Start with key parts that are unlikely to be eliminated from the design or
to be drastically changed.
Mate the first part to datum planes to fix it on the coordinate system, so
that it does not move.
Assemble functional units into subassemblies first before adding them to
the main assembly.
Assembly Constraints
Different software packages offer a similar set of constraint options.
Become familiar with those available to you in your software. Table 10.1 on
page 422 lists some of the common assembly constraints and their
definitions.
Table 10.1 Common Assembly Constraints.

another
Offset An option for an assembly
constraint that allows you to

Flip An option for an assembly
constraint that allows you to

for a plane, axis, or other entity
Just as feature relationships are important to the way you create a model,
assembly relationships can make your assembly model work for you.Consider the following as you add parts to the assembly:
Use constraints to orient the new part that reflect relationships that will
persist in the assembly.
Think about the mechanism and the types of connections that parts
should have to be a working device.
Leave fasteners until last and insert them in manageable groups.
You can create a subassembly in much the same way that you create an
assembly: by making an assembly of the subassembly components. This
subassembly can be added to the main assembly in the same way you add a
part. Organizing the model so that it comes together as it will on the
assembly line aids in visualizing assembly difficulties. If a group of
components are likely to be changed or replaced, linking all the subparts to
a main component can make it easy to substitute an alternative design for
that group of parts.
Spotlight
Dynamic Assemblies: The Zuma Brewer
Dynamic assemblies provide an advantage to design teams sharing files
over a network. The assembly model brings together individual part design
with the overall product effort. Most systems let you dynamically update
your view of a part in the assembly even while someone else is activelychanging it. This keeps the assembly current and ensures that the part you
are designing fits with the other parts in the assembly.
Many benefits of constraint-based modeling directly related to assembly
capabilities. VKI Technologies’ single-cup coffee brewers require many
moving parts and sophisticated electronics all contained in a compact, easy￾to-use coffee maker. Using constraint-based modeling helped them fit the
many components into smaller machines while reducing design time almost
50%.
The Zuma brewer assembly pulled together 62 different parts, shown in
Figure 10.5. The assembly allowed the designer to be sure the components
fit compactly yet did not interfere with one another. Moving parts were
rotated through their range of motion in the assembly model to analyze and
eliminate conflicts with other parts.10.5 The 62 individual parts in the assembly model of the Zuma brewer are shown in a wireframe
view. (Courtesy of VKI Technologies, a division of Keurig, Canada, Inc.)
A big advantage of an assembly model is its role as a virtual prototype. For
the Zuma brewer, the ability to visualize parts in 3D and evaluate them for
fit with other parts almost eliminated the need to create physical models of
the parts. When the brewer design was complete, the model was used to
generate molds for the 15 plastic parts in the brewer. When the first realmolded parts were available, they fit together well enough to make a
functional brewer. In the past, with many parts and a limited amount of
time, it was not uncommon for fit problems to be discovered after
manufacture, not before.
Managing Assembly Files
The links between files that make dynamic assemblies possible also make it
important to manage your files effectively. Use directory structures and
naming conventions to keep your files organized. The extra time it takes to
name and store your file in the appropriate directory can save hours of
searching for the file at a later date.
File management is especially important when you are working in a design
team using networked computers. Manage your files so that everyone can
easily find them. Without good communication and an organized system for
storing files, it is not unusual for one engineer to spend considerable time
modifying a part only to have the latest modification not be used in the
assembly because it was stored in the wrong directory.
It can happen that two different people modify the same part, undoing each
other’s changes. If you work as part of a team, make it clear who has the
responsibility for changing different parts. One person should have
“ownership” and the ability to make changes to the part file. If a change inanother part requires a change to a part for which you are responsible, you
should be notified of the changes so you can update your part accordingly.
Some systems allow other team members to work with the file in read-only
mode. This way, everyone can view the part, and perhaps even indicate
changes, but changes are not made until the owner of the part approves
them. This prevents different designers from concurrently changing the
part.
Your software may manage how files are linked or externally referenced
and how others access the files (see Figure 10.6). As you create assembly
models, be aware of these options and how your work group uses them.
Some companies invest in Product Data Management (PDM) systems that
organize the design database and control the work flow process.10.6 The SolidWorks Pack and Go feature lets you gather the assembly, parts, drawings, and other
model information to copy or move a project, without losing the linked files. If you did not use this
feature, you would need to remember to copy or move each of the individual files to open the
assembly file. (Image courtesy of ©2016 Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks Corporation.)
10.2 Assemblies and Design
To work efficiently and concurrently, it is important that each designer be
clear on the design intent so that problems of fit are minimized at later
stages. Constraint-based modeling software also allows you to start with an
assembly framework that can be used to define the design intent or
parameters for individual parts and to help coordinate the work of different
team members.With this method, parts are designed so they link to a framework that
defines major relationships in the assembly. This may be a skeleton using
lines, arcs, curves, and points to show the assembly relationships. When
you create the framework for each part up front, all parts do not have to be
finished before they can be assembled. Parts can be assembled onto the
skeleton at any stage of completion. Allowing the assembly to evolve as the
parts are designed and refined allows each designer to see the parts the
others are creating—or at least the critical relationships between parts—by
looking at the assembly.
Top-down design starts the design by examining the function of the entire
system, breaking that down into subassemblies or component groups based
on their major functions, and, finally, defining each part that must be
manufactured and assembled to create the design.
Bottom-up design starts at the part level, sizing individual components and
building the design up from them. This is typically the approach used when
components are standardized parts.
Middle-out design combines these two methods: some major standardized
parts are used in the assembly to begin the design. The new components are
designed to fit with these parts and function in the overall assembly.
An example of middle-out design is the Romulus Predator prototype, which
was planned to combine racing capability with everyday street driving(Figure 10.7). This vehicle was never intended for mass production; the
design and production costs would be recouped from a small manufacturing
run. The design team used commercially available components such as
brakes, steering column, steering wheel, and engine components to keep
development costs down. These off-the-shelf parts were modeled in 3D and
added to the assembly model. The custom parts were designed to work with
these stock parts.

of the Predator was taken from the surface model created in ICEM Surf. (Courtesy of Mark Gerisch.)
Layout Drawings
Traditionally, top-down design uses layout drawings to show the
relationships between major functional items in the design. Layout
drawings are especially useful when the product or system being designed
has to fit with existing equipment. By defining the critical distances for fitwith the existing equipment, the layout drawing documents the size
constraints for the new equipment.
A typical layout drawing is shown in Figure 10.8. Note that the drawing is
not complete in every detail but shows the major centerlines, sizes, and
relationships between parts.

Assembling to a Skeleton
A wireframe skeleton in a 3D model serves the same purpose as a layout
drawing. It is a framework on which the individual components can belocated. Figure 10.9 shows a skeleton model used to control the location
and position of parts in the assembly model of a clamp.10.9 (a) Skeleton model for the clamp assembly; (b) parts assembled onto the skeleton; (c)
changing dimensions of the skeleton controls the positions in the assembly; (d) resulting change in
the assembly. (Courtesy of Mark Perkins.)
To create a skeleton model, first define the critical dimensions in your
assembly. What dimensions are fixed—because of a physical space
requirement, sizing requirement, or some other relationship? What
dimensions are likely to change later in the design process? How will each
part relate to the others in the assembly? Begin your skeleton as a part
model made up of a constraint-based framework of 3D planes, lines, curves,
and points that identify the basic relationships between parts in the
assembly.Figure 10.10a shows a skeleton model created for a laser printer. The
dimensions between the planes, lines, points, and other entities making up
the skeleton can be changed as needed as the design evolves to preserve the
interfaces between parts. Changing the dimensions of the skeleton also
allows the clearances and interferences between parts to be checked when
the device is in different positions. By establishing this framework initially,
each designer can upload a part to the assembly at any time to see how it
will operate within the constraints established by the framework. Because
the skeleton is made up of lines, planes, points, and other entities that do not
have volume, using a skeleton will not change the mass property analysis
for the assembly.10.10 Printer Assembly. (a) The skeleton model for this laser printer subassembly establishes a 3D
framework for relationships between parts or groups of parts. (b) As parts are designed, their center
points or edges are matched to the datum planes and axes of the skeleton. (c) In the completed
subassembly all the parts are matched to their locations. (d) The completed printer assembly is
shown with the covers removed. (e) The finished printer assembly. (Courtesy of Xerox Corporation.)
Global Parameters
A global parameter is one that is the same across multiple parts. You can
use global parameters to control the size of a feature so that mating features
can be resized as a group.
Consider the fit between the mating parts shown in Figure 10.11. The holes
on the mounting brackets and tray must align and must be roughly the same
size so that a machine screw will fit through both parts. By creating a globalparameter for the size of the hole, called in this case Hole_Size, you can
change the size of the hole feature on both the brackets and the tray at once.10.11 (a) The holes in the brackets and tray are defined by the global parameter Hole_Size that has
the value .50 to fit a .50-diameter round head machine screw. (b) The holes in both parts are changed
to .25 by updating the global Hole_Size parameter value.
Global parameters can be defined for any dimension to be shared by parts in
the assembly. You may define a global parameter from the skeleton itself to
drive critical distances on part features.
Global parameters also make it possible to build relationships into the
assembly as you would for an individual part. The drilling rig in Figure
10.12 contains more than five thousand parts but was designed to be resized
to fit different drilling situations. Changes can be made at the assembly
level (the top level) to change the width from any corner, the overall height,
and the height of any bay. Equations in the dimension parameters for
individual parts reference global parameters that when changed cause all
parts in the assembly to be updated to the new size.10.12 IRI International has parametric models for different derrick styles. The basic rig structure is
quickly reshaped to begin work on the design of custom parts for the new rig. (Courtesy of National Oilwell
Varco (NOV).)
Seed PartsSeed parts, also called templates or prototype drawings, are another
technique for assembling parts effectively and for starting new drawings
quickly and systematically. Seed part files contain elements you want every
model to contain. A seed part might have a set of datum planes defined
according to the company standard, named view orientations matched to the
datum planes, unit settings, coordinate systems, layer names, and other
items. Starting your new parts from a seed part saves you the time it would
take to create these settings and elements in a new file.
Seed parts can help you assemble parts by providing a standard orientation.
For example, when you assemble two parts, you may want a common
datum surface to face the same direction on each part. Using a seed part,
where standard datum planes have already been set up and named to make
them easy to identify, can help you quickly insert your part in the correct
orientation with respect to the rest of the assembly. Using standard view
names as a part of your seed drawing helps you quickly produce views from
your models (Figure 10.13).10.13 Templates. (a) The default template starts with some standard planes and view orientations.
(b) This custom part template (or seed part) includes additional views, a coordinate system, and a
live sectioning plane (a plane that will show a 3D section view of the model without actually
changing the model). (Images courtesy of ©2016 Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks Corporation.)
Other members of the design team save time in creating a drawing from
your model when you use consistent view-naming conventions.
Seed parts with consistent layer names can eliminate confusion in viewing
assemblies. By starting parts with the same basic set of layers, you can keep
the assembly organized and make it easy for other users to identify on
which layer a feature would typically be shown.
If your company has a standard title block, tolerance block, notes, and set of
required views, seed parts or prototype drawings can help produce drawings
that all have the same high-quality appearance even when created by
different users. Even if such a file is not a company standard, setting one up
with this information eliminates having to re-create it each time. Standard
notes that you can edit or delete if not appropriate also remind you to
include important information on the drawing.
Modeling packages come with default settings for new files. Some settings
that are stored with the drawing or model file may be included in a seed
part. If you find that you are consistently changing a setting with every new
drawing, the setting might be a candidate for inclusion into a seed part,
template drawing, or stored custom interface. Scripts and macros are other
great time savers when you have a repeated task.Tip
You can save time creating new parts by adding often-used views and
default settings to a seed part or template. Read about template files in your
modeler’s Help to determine which settings can be saved with such a file.
Common items are the following:
Datum planes
Named 3D views
Unit settings
User coordinate systems
Layers and layer names
Drawing elements such as title and revision blocks and standard notes
Drawing styles and views
Customized workspace settings
Constraint-Based Drawing Elements
Another way to add borders, title blocks, and other drawing elements to
your drawing is to link them parametrically as you would a part file. This
allows you to create a title block and reuse it for all your drawings. This
title block can prompt you for the engineer’s name, approval date, material
information, tolerances, and other information as parameters. If you use
linked title blocks and other drawing information, you must manage thefiles for these linked items carefully as deleting the original title block
makes it unavailable to any drawings where it was used.
10.3 Assemblies and Simulation
An accurate and detailed assembly model allows simulation of the
interactions between components in your design. Creating a skeleton model
to drive the assembly geometry is one way to make a dynamic assembly
that allows you to study component interactions. Another method is to
assemble your parts using special “mechanism”-style assembly constraints.
For example, instead of aligning the centers of a hole and a shaft, you can
specify a “pin”-type joint. These joints restrict the degrees of freedom of the
part in the assembly. Once you have the assembly defined in this way, you
can use it to explore real-world behaviors of the mechanism. Figure 10.14
shows an example mechanism with forces applied to simulate the assembly
function.10.14 This assembly model simulates the real-world forces on a Maserati MC12 race car
suspension. Notice the yellow symbols showing the forces that are applied to the model. (Copyright ©
PTC Inc.)
Depending on the software you have, you may be able to simulate part
contacts; measure interference between parts; simulate gravity, springs,
dampers, belts, gears, friction, and ergonomics; as well as perform
kinematic analysis directly in your modeling environment. You will learn
more about this later in this chapter.
10.4 Parts for Assemblies
To fully enjoy the benefits of a digital assembly model, your design
database should include all the parts designed for the assembly. Most
constraint-based modeling software allows you to add and import non￾constraint-based parts to the constraint-based assembly so they can be
represented during the design refinement process (see Figure 10.15).10.15 All the components of this engine assembly were modeled as solids—whether they were new
or off-the-shelf—so that the Predator assembly model would be complete and could serve as a virtual
prototype for the car. (Courtesy of Mark Gerisch.)
Standard Parts
Using standard company parts (or purchased parts that are readily available)
can be cost-effective for two reasons:
They do not have to be designed. Many suppliers provide models of their
parts in a variety of CAD formats that you can insert into your assembly
model. Using standard company parts that were designed for another
project saves design effort.Parts manufactured in quantity have a lower per-piece price. Some
companies maintain a library of parts on the network that can easily be
used. Sharing the part among more products helps increase the volume
used. A parts database is useful even when manufacturing quantities are
not high, as the company saves design time for every part reused.
When a company part is not available, a part that meets your need may be
available from a supplier. Some engineers spend up to 20% of their time
redrawing standard parts to show how they will fit with the newly designed
parts in the assembly. Finding a model available from the supplier lets you
spend your time designing the new components needed to get the job done.
Many sites provide their parts in standard 2D and 3D formats (such as .dxf,
IGES, or STEP) and in the native formats for different modelers (such as
AutoCAD and SolidWorks). Figure 10.16 shows a plastic knob available in
2D and 3D CAD formats from the vendor Davies Molding.10.16 CAD models of this plastic knob are available in a variety of formats. The CAD Drawings
selection from ThomasNet.com makes it easy to find vendor part models like this one. (Courtesy of Davies
Molding, LLC.)
Common parts are also available in libraries that ship with your software or
in third-party part libraries. These parts often have the advantage of being
modeled using constraints so their sizes can easily be changed.
Fastener LibrariesMany modeling packages provide part libraries for fasteners, bearings, and
other items that are a frequent part of many designs (see Figure 10.17). If
your software does not, you may want to build a library of typical fasteners
used by your company so that you can quickly place them into assembly
models. Many suppliers provide 3D models of their parts to make it easy to
show them in your assemblies (Figure 10.18).
10.17 SolidWorks provides drag-and-drop fasteners as a part of the Toolbox parts library. Notice
the list of configurations for the fastener shown. These allow one model to serve different sets of
parameter values stored. Because the basic shape of the fastener is the same, it can quickly be
resized to different sizes. After a configuration is chosen, it can be further customized, as shown in
this screen. (Image courtesy of ©2016 Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks Corporation.)10.18 CAD models of standard parts are available for download from companies like Stock Drive
Products/Sterling Instrument. (Courtesy of Stock Drive Products/Sterling Instrument, sdp-si.com.)
10.5 Using your Model to Check Fits
When parts are accurately modeled in 3D and organized into an assembly,
you can use the assembly to perform fit and interference checking on the
models. Doing a thorough study of how the parts will fit once assembled
can save time and money. After tooling has already been produced to
manufacture parts, changes to the design become very expensive.
Because the parts in the assembly can be shaded and viewed from any
direction on the computer monitor, you can visually inspect the fits and
clearances. You can also make measurements and list dimension values to
compare parts with one another. Most solid and constraint-based modeling
software also provides a command for checking the interference between
two parts.Interference Checking
Interference is the amount of overlap between one part and another. When
you use a command to check the interference between two parts in an
assembly, the solid modeling software will report that the solids do not
interfere or will indicate the amount of overlap—sometimes by creating a
new solid to represent the overlap (see Figure 10.19).
10.19 The shaft is checked against the support arms to see whether these parts interfere. (Courtesy of
Dynojet Research, Inc.)
Because constraint-based modeling software makes it easy to assemble
parts early in the design process, interference checking tools can alsofacilitate more effective concurrent engineering. For example, Boeing’s
designers are responsible for checking their work in the digital pre￾assembly model of the aircraft to identify places where the system or
component they are designing will interfere with work in progress in other
areas of the design. Each designer then takes steps to resolve the
interference with the appropriate designers for the systems involved.
Manufacturing processes have certain ranges of accuracy. Requiring a high
tolerance—one with very little allowable deviation—can limit the choice of
manufacturing process to those that can be expected to meet that level of
accuracy. Specifying very small tolerance values can increase the cost of the
finished piece. In general, tolerances should allow as much variation as
possible without affecting the functionality of the design.
Material selection also plays a role in the accuracy of the finished parts.
Parts can be manufactured more accurately from some materials than
others. In addition to determining the tolerance range for a part based on its
function in the assembly, talk to personnel in manufacturing or the vendors
who will make the parts. You should fully understand the issues in
manufacturing the part to the dimensions and accuracy you specified and
the effect this has on the price for the finished parts.
Some CAD software allows you to specify a tolerance range for a
dimension and then apply that to the feature at either the upper or lower end
of the dimension range. By doing so, you can run a check on how the partswill fit at the minimum and maximum clearance values. Figure 10.20 shows
the options for analyzing tolerances using PTC® Creo®.
10.20 PTC® Creo® provides a sophisticated interface for performing fit studies for a range of part
tolerances. (Copyright © PTC Inc.)
Even if your software does not provide functions for checking fits at the
lower and upper limits of the tolerance range, you can systematically
change the dimensions for mating features to represent the minimum
clearance, then inspect the model to see how the parts fit.
Accessibility Checking
The assembly model can also be used to ensure that the design can be
assembled. Whether the assembly will be done by robots or humans, parts
and fasteners must be accessible. Many devices and systems also need to berepaired or upgraded later, requiring access well after the assembly phase.
The 3D design database can be used to check whether people will be able to
reach a part to remove or repair it after the system is assembled.
Ergonomic analysis software can help determine accessibility for assembly
and repair. Ergonomics studies the ability of humans to use a system. Many
ergonomic analysis packages have 3D models of human beings
(anthropomorphic data) that you can position inside the designed system to
see how people will fit.
Even if robots will assemble the components, people will often perform
repairs. Evaluating repair issues can be even more difficult than assembly
issues, because the assembly can proceed in such a way that interior parts
are fitted together before their exteriors obscure access and visibility. You
can use ergonomic analysis or human models to check whether parts can be
reached to repair them, as shown in Figure 10.21.10.21 Planning access to an airplane for service and repair is an important part of its design. This
digital mannequin was imported into the CATIA software used by Boeing to evaluate the accessibility
of its parts. (Copyright © Boeing.)
10.6 Manufacturing Processes
In this section you will learn some basic information about the impact that
three manufacturing processes may have on the design of individual parts.
Keep in mind that this is not intended to be a thorough presentation of
everything you need to know about a particular process or all processes.
You can learn more about manufacturing in engineering courses and from
on the job experience.
10.22 Injection molds have two halves that separate to release the plastic part.Designing Plastic Parts
Injection-molded plastic parts have characteristics you must consider when
designing for them. Molded parts in general must include draft, or taper,
that allows the part to be removed from the mold. Plastic shrinks as it cools,
and the shrinkage plus the draft allows the parts to be removed from the
mold into a collection bin. If the shape of the part requires it, ejector pins
may be necessary to force the part out of the mold. Usually, the mold
designer will determine the necessary cooling lines, ejector pins, and other
features, but you should be aware of the general process. Ejector pins may
leave a slight mark on the finished part. If these marks would negatively
affect the cosmetics of your design, you may need to change the part shape
so that it is removed from the mold easily and does not require ejector pins.
You can identify important cosmetic surfaces on the part when you send
drawings or files to the manufacturer so the mold maker can use this
information when designing the mold.
The parting line is where the two mold halves come together. If you look at
common molded plastic parts, such as the one shown in Figure 10.23, you
may see a fine line in the plastic where the two halves of the mold came
together. You may also see marks where ejector pins pushed the part out of
the mold (Figure 10.24).10.23 Parting Line. Injection-molded parts may have a visible line where the mold halves joined.
10.24 Ejector pins may create marks on the surface. Surface defects such as sink marks are created
when the mold fills or cools improperly. (Courtesy of Rebling Plastics.)When you model parts for injection molding, consider how the part will
remove from the mold. Although there are some molding methods (such as
slides) that allow you to make interior holes, the part cannot have a shape
that will not allow it to be removed from the mold. Look at the part shape in
Figure 10.25; the lip of the bowl makes it impossible to remove from the
mold.
10.25 Can you see why this part could not easily be removed from the mold?
As you design molded parts, plan for the parting line and design it so that
both sides will be removed from the mold. You may want to add a
construction plane to your CAD model, then project its edge onto the part
as shown in Figure 10.26 to represent the parting line. Add draft to the
surfaces of the part on each side of the parting line.10.26 The construction plane in this part identifies the location of the mold’s parting line. The draft
angle is added to the part on both sides of the parting line. (Courtesy of Robert Kincaid.)
The amount of draft is decided by the size of the part, the finish of the
mold, and the type of material and its shrink rate, among other factors. The
Society of the Plastics Industry publishes guidelines to help you determine
the exact amount of draft to add to the part. Usually, the mold designer will
determine the shrinkage for the part and size the mold cavity so that the
final parts will be to the size specified. Part shrinkage is not always uniform
along the X-, Y-, and Z-directions. Many CAD packages can be used to size
the part for shrinkage as well as add the draft.10.27 Plastic parts such as these toys must be designed so they can be removed from the mold. (Ian
Dikhtiar/Shutterstock.)
The following are four guidelines for designing injection molded plastic:
1. Try to maintain a constant wall thickness. See Figure 10.28a. The
thickness of the plastic affects the rate at which it cools. Uniform wall
thickness helps prevent sink marks in the plastic and keeps the part flat
and uniform once molded. If wall thicknesses must change, make the
change gradually instead of abruptly.10.28 (a) Maintain a constant wall thickness on injection-molded parts.(b) Round all inside and
outside corners to improve release from the mold and relieve mold stress concentrations. (c) Use
the maximum draft angle. (d) Size projections so they are no more than 70% of the wall thickness
and no longer than four times the wall thickness. (Ice cube tray photo copyright Yossi James/Shutterstock.)
2. Round all inside and outside corners so parts will easily be removed
from the mold. Rounded corners also improve uniform mold filling andhelp relieve stress concentrations in the mold. See Figure 10.28b.
3. Use the maximum allowable draft angle, and never less than 1° per
side. See Figure 10.28c. Draft allows the parts to be removed from the
mold. When parts are designed without enough draft, a vacuum can be
created between the part and the side of the mold during removal. In
extreme cases, this can damage the mold. When molded parts will have a
surface texture, the draft angle must be increased to allow the part to be
removed without damaging the texture.
4. Projections typically should be not more than 70% of the normal wall
thickness. See Figure 10.28d. For best results, projections should be no
more than two and a half to four times the wall thickness in length. A
projection or rib that is too thick can cause sink marks on the opposite
side of the part.
Cast Parts
Casting is the process of forming a part by pouring molten metal into a
hollow mold. Many of the design issues for cast parts are similar to those
for plastic parts. For example, surfaces must have draft and rounded corners
to make it possible to remove the part from the mold.
In sand casting, you create a pattern to place in the sand to create the mold
cavity. (The pattern may need to be larger than the finished part, as
shrinkage occurs as the molded metal cools.) A gating system is added to
allow the molten material to flow into the cavity and vents air when themolten metal is poured in. Sand is packed around the pattern and gating to
create the mold. Then the pattern is removed to create the cavity. Molten
metal is poured into the cavity, and once the metal is cooled, the mold is
removed from the casting. Permanent molds are also possible, where the
sand is bonded so the part may be removed without destroying the mold
(Figure 10.29).
10.29 A Permanent Mold Casting Cooling on the Exit Conveyor Belt (Courtesy of Edelbrock Aluminum
Foundries.)
Like most molding processes, sand castings have two mold sides, called the
cope and the drag . The flask is the term for the vessel that holds the packed
sand around the part pattern. Cores can be added to form hollow recesses in
the part. The final surface of the cast part is relatively rough where ittouched the sand mold. The cast part may be machined to provide smoother
surfaces on features where it is needed.
The Aluminum Association publishes the Standard for Aluminum Sand and
Permanent Mold Castings, which is a useful guide to design requirements
for these types of parts. Figure 10.30 shows two versions of a steel
mounting bracket, (a) designed for casting and (b) designed for stamping
from sheet metal.
10.30 Two Steel Mounting Brackets. (a) Designed for Casting; (b) Designed for Stamping
Modeling Machined Parts
Machining processes remove material to produce the part shape desired. A
rotating cutting tool shaves away material to form the shape of the part.
These processes were some of the first to be computer controlled and are a
common way to form metal parts.Many machined parts start from common stock shapes such as round,
square, plate, hex, block, and bar stock steel that come in standard sizes.
When it is possible to use a standard size in your design, it may lower the
cost to produce the part.
Some features, such as a perfectly square interior corner, are difficult to
produce with this process. If you are planning your part for NC machining,
avoid features that are difficult to machine or require multiple machine
setups, unless they are needed. (You can make square interior corners using
the electrodischarge machining process.) Fillets and rounds that result from
machining methods provide additional strength and smooth the corners so
they are not sharp when the part is handled. Figure 10.31 shows a part that
has been milled (top) and a part that has been turned on a lathe (bottom).10.31 Milled Part (top); Part Turned on a Lathe (bottom) (Courtesy of PENCOM.)
Modeling Sheet Metal Parts
Sheet metal parts, such as the one shown in Figure 10.32, are laid out as a
flat pattern that is then bent into shape.images
10.32 The 3D part in (a) will be formed by cutting the flat pattern (b) from a piece of sheet metal
and bending it into shape. (Courtesy of J. E. Soares.)
When modeling sheet metal parts, you may start by modeling them in 3D to
visualize how they fit with mating parts. Each surface on the part must be
shown true size in the flat pattern. Additional material for hems or overlaps
to be welded must be added and the bend allowance factored in. The bend
allowance is determined by how much the metal compresses and stretches
when it is bent. Its value depends on the thickness and material of the metal.
When the part is manufactured, it will start as a flat part cut from a sheet of
uniform-thickness material. Sheet metal design features are available inmost CAD modeling software that allow you to model the part with the
bends and show the part in its flat or final shape.
Other sheet metal parts may be difficult to manufacture because of the way
they must be bent. The brake press in Figure 10.33 is commonly used to
form sheet metal parts by bending the metal along a straight line. Without
special tooling, some parts may be impossible to bend without deforming
other sections of the part.

10.33 Brake Press (Copyright Prasit Rodphan/Shutterstock.)
Keep the following things in mind when modeling sheet metal parts:
The bend location should allow enough material for the bend; material is
compressed on the inside of the bend and stretched on the outside of the
bend. Generally a flange (bent area) should be no smaller than 4 times
the sheet thickness plus the allowance for the bend radius.
Keep a single bend radius, when possible, to eliminate the need for tool
changes or setups.
The inside bend radius should be greater or equal to the sheet thickness.
Compression of the material for a smaller radius is problematic.
Do not locate holes, slots and similar features too near a bend or their
shapes may be distorted during the bending process. Allow 3 times the
sheet thickness plus the bending radius between a bend and a holefeature. In general, check with a sheet metal manufacturer who you are
likely to be working with and inquire about their minimum allowance
recommendations before your design is finalized.
Another consideration in sheet metal part design is arranging the flat pattern
so that the parts nest together to waste the least amount of material.
Software packages that can aid in the development of the flat pattern from a
3D wireframe, solid, or surface model (see Figure 10.34) oftentimes will
help with pattern nesting to reduce waste material.

Inc. (www.salient-tech.com))
Holes in sheet metal parts are often created by a punch, such as an
automated punch press. Standard punches can quickly create openings in
the sheet metal part. Figure 10.35 shows a library of shapes corresponding
to standard punches.
images
10.35 These 2D outlines are a library of shapes that correspond to standard punches.
To help in designing sheet metal parts, you may want to keep a library of
2D outlines of standard punch shapes. You can then use these standard
shapes to create 3D model geometry by importing the 2D section into yourfile and extruding and subtracting the feature to create the opening. Many
CAD packages provide a variety of standard sheet metal features.
Some parts are possible to design but not possible to develop into a flat
pattern. Figure 10.36 shows an example. This part cannot be created from a
single flat sheet, as it would overlap itself.

manufacturing processes and limitations is essential for good design.images

10.39 Practical Design Dos and Don’ts
Casting Design
Figure 10.38 shows drawings of casting designs containing common design
flaws alongside preferred alternatives.
Many difficulties in producing good castings result from abrupt changes in
section or thickness. In Figure 10.38a, rib thicknesses are uniform so that
the metal will flow easily to all parts. Fillet radii are equal to the rib
thickness—a good general rule to follow. Whenever it is necessary to join a
thin feature to a thicker feature, the thin feature should be thickened as it
approaches the intersection, as shown in Figure 10.38b.
In Figures 10.38c, g, and h, coring is used to produce walls with more￾uniform sections. In Figure 10.38d, an abrupt change in sections is avoided
by making thinner walls and leaving a collar.
Figures 10.38e and f show examples in which the preferred design tends to
allow the castings to cool without introducing internal stresses. The less
desirable design is more likely to crack as it cools, since there is no give in
the design. Curved spokes are preferable to straight spokes, and an oddnumber of spokes is better than an even number, because direct stresses
along opposite spokes are avoided.
The design of a part may cause unnecessary trouble and expense for the
pattern shop and foundry without any benefit to the design. For example, in
the poor designs in Figures 10.38j and k, one-piece patterns would not
withdraw from the sand, and two-piece patterns would be necessary. In the
preferred examples, the design is just as useful and would be more
economical in the pattern shop and foundry.
Practical Considerations
Figure 10.39 shows some basic practical considerations for manufacturing
designs using various materials. In Figure 10.39a, a narrower piece of stock
sheet metal can be used for certain designs that can be linked or overlapped.
In this case, the stampings may be overlapped if dimension W is increased
slightly, as shown, to save material.
The hardness of heat-treated steel depends on carbon content. To get
maximum hardness, it is necessary to rapidly cool (quench) the steel after
heating, so it is important that a design can be quenched uniformly. In
Figure 10.39b, the solid piece will harden well on the outside but will
remain soft and relatively weak on the inside. The hollow piece in the
preferred example can be quenched from both the outside and inside. Thus,
a hardened hollow shaft can actually be stronger than a solid one.In Figure 10.39c, a rounded groove (neck) around a shaft next to a shoulder
eliminates a practical difficulty in precision grinding. Not only are sharp
corners more expensive to grind, but sharp corners often lead to cracking
and failure.
In Figure 10.39d the design at the right eliminates a costly reinforced weld,
which would be needed in the design at left. The preferred example has
strong virgin metal with a generous radius at the point where the stress is
likely to be most severe. It is possible to make the design on the left as
strong as that on the right, but it requires more expense, expertise, and
special equipment.
It is difficult to drill into a slanting surface, as shown at the left in Figure
10.39e . Drilling is much easier if a boss is provided, as shown at right.
The design at the left in Figure 10.39f requires accurate boring or reaming
of a blind hole all the way to a flat bottom, which is difficult and expensive.
It is better to drill deeper than the hole is to be finished, as shown at the
right, to provide room for tool clearance and chips.
In Figure 10.39g, the drill and counterbore in the upper example cannot be
used for the hole in the centerpiece because of the raised portion at the right
end. In the preferred example, the end is redesigned to provide access for
the drill and counterbore.In the top design in Figure 10.39h, the ends are not the same height, so each
flat surface must be machined separately. In the design below, the ends are
the same height, the surfaces are in line horizontally, and only two
machining operations are necessary. It is always good to simplify and limit
the machining as much as possible.
The design at the left in Figure 10.39j requires that the housing be bored for
the entire length to receive a pressed bushing. Machining time can be
decreased if the cored recess is made as shown, assuming that average loads
would be applied in use.
The lower bolt in Figure 10.39k is encircled by a rounded groove no deeper
than the root of the thread. This makes a gentle transition from the small
diameter at the root of the threads to the large diameter of the body of the
bolt, producing less stress concentration and a stronger bolt. In general,
sharp internal corners should be avoided because these are points of stress
concentration and possible failure.
In Figure 10.39m, a .25′′ steel plate is being pulled, as shown by the
arrows. Increasing the radius of the inside corners increases the strength of
the plate by distributing the load over a greater area.
10.8 Manufacturing Materials
An ever-increasing variety of materials are available, each having its own
characteristics, applications, advantages, and limitations. The followinggeneral types of materials are used in manufacturing.
Ferrous metals: carbon, alloy, stainless, and tool and die steels.
Nonferrous metals: aluminum, magnesium, copper, nickel, titanium,
superalloys, refractory metals, beryllium, zirconium, low-melting alloys,
and precious metals.
Plastics: thermoplastics, thermosets, and elastomers.
Ceramics: glass ceramics, glasses, graphite, diamond, and diamond-like
materials.
Composite materials: reinforced plastics, metal-matrix and ceramic￾matrix composites. These are also known as engineered materials.
Nanomaterials: shape-memory alloys, amorphous alloys,
superconductors, and various others.
As new materials are developed, the selection of appropriate materials
becomes even more challenging. There are constantly shifting trends in the
usage of materials in all products, driven principally by economic needs.
Many examples of product failure can be traced to poor selection of
material or manufacturing processes or poor control of process variables. A
component or a product is generally considered to have failed when:
It stops functioning (broken shaft, gear, bolt, cable, or turbine blade).
It does not function properly or perform within required specification
limits (worn bearings, gears, tools, and dies).It becomes unreliable or unsafe for further use (frayed cable in a winch,
crack in a shaft, poor connection in a printed circuit board, or
delamination of a reinforced plastic component).
When selecting materials for products, consider their mechanical properties:
strength, toughness, ductility, hardness, elasticity, fatigue, and creep. The
strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios of material are also
important, particularly for aerospace and automotive applications.
Aluminum, titanium, and reinforced plastics, for example, have higher
values of these ratios than steels and cast irons. The mechanical properties
specified for a product and its components should, of course, be for the
conditions under which the product is expected to function. Then, consider
the physical properties of density, specific heat, thermal expansion and
conductivity, melting point, and electrical and magnetic properties.

Chemical properties also play a significant role in hostile as well as normal
environments. Oxidation, corrosion, general degradation of properties,
toxicity, and flammability of materials are among the important factors to
be considered. In some commercial airline disasters, for example, deaths
occurred by toxic fumes from burning nonmetallic materials in the cabin.Manufacturing properties of materials determine whether they can be cast,
formed, machined, welded, and heat-treated with relative ease (Table 10.3).
Methods used to process materials to the desired shapes can adversely
affect the product’s final properties, service life, and cost.
Table 10.3 General Manufacturing Characteristics of Various Alloys
Alloy Castability Weldability Machinability
Aluminum Excellent Fair Good/Excellent
Copper Fair/Good Fair Fair/Good
Gray cast iron Excellent Difficult Good
White cast iron Good Very Poor Very Poor
Nickel Fair Fair Fair
Steels Fair Excellent Fair
Zinc Excellent Difficult ExcellentCost and availability of raw and processed materials and manufactured
components are major concerns in manufacturing. Competitively, the
economic aspects of material selection are as important as the technological
considerations of properties and characteristics of materials.
If raw or processed materials or manufactured components are not available
in the desired shapes, dimensions, and quantities, substitutes and/or
additional processing will be required, which can contribute significantly to
product cost. For example, if a round bar of a certain diameter is not
available in standard form, then a larger rod must be purchased and its
diameter reduced by some means, such as machining, drawing through a
die, or grinding. When possible, modify the product design to take
advantage of standard dimensions of raw materials, thus avoiding additional
manufacturing costs.
Different costs are involved in processing materials by different methods.
Some methods require expensive machinery, others require extensive labor,
and still others require personnel with special skills, a high level of
education, or specialized training.
Material Assignment in Models
When CAD software allows you to assign materials to your 3D parts, the
materials can be used to calculate mass properties of parts and assemblies
and for rendering appearances. This information is often stored in a
database or in separate material files. Once you have defined a materialfile, you can store and reuse it, saving you the effort of having to look up
and redefine the material information each time it is needed. The calculated
mass of your part depends on the density for the material that is entered in
this file and the units for that density. The Material dialog box from
SolidWorks in Figure 10.40 shows several standard materials predefined for
you and the kinds of properties you can set.
images
10.40 The Material Properties of 1060 Aluminum Alloy. SolidWorks and other modelers provide
preexisting materials that you can assign to parts. You also can set the properties of a material and
save them in a custom material file that you can apply to your parts. (Image courtesy of ©2016 Dassault
Systèmes SolidWorks Corporation.)
When entering this information, match the units to the other units you are
using. For example, if the mass density for the material is expected to be
entered in slugs per cubic inch, and you enter the value using slugs per
cubic feet , the resulting calculations for the mass will be off by a
significant factor—1728. When using material files from an existing library,
you must take particular care to notice the units in which the information
was entered and make sure that it matches the units you are using for your
model.
Some CAD software uses a density of 1.00 for all materials or when parts
have no material assigned and reports the mass based on this value. When a
CAD system uses a density of 1.00 to calculate the mass of your model, you
can calculate the actual mass by knowing the specific gravity of thematerial (which can be looked up in a materials table). If you do not check
the calculations by hand and inadvertently use the density of 1.00 (as
though your model were made of water), your incorrect mass value may
cause a significant error.
Spotlight
Specific Gravity
Specific gravity is the value that can be used to relate the density of
different materials by comparing them with the density of water. The mass
density of distilled water at a temperature of 20° C is 1 gram per cubic
centimeter, and its specific gravity is 1.00. Notice that specific gravity has
no units. Gold has a specific gravity of 19. This essentially means that a
volume of gold is 19 times as heavy as the same volume of water. The
specific gravities for some other common materials are as follows:
Aluminum alloys 2.8
Stainless steel 7.8
Brass 8.6
Titanium 4.410.9 Appearance, Service Life, and Recycling
Color, feel, and surface texture determined by material appearance are all
characteristics that we consider when making a decision about purchasing a
product. Time- and service-dependent phenomena such as wear, fatigue,
creep, and dimensional stability are also important. These phenomena can
significantly affect a product’s performance and, if not controlled, can lead
to total failure of the product. Similarly, compatibility of materials used in a
product is important. Friction, wear, and corrosion can shorten a product’s
life or cause it to fail prematurely. Another phenomenon that can cause
failure is galvanic corrosion between mating parts made of dissimilar
metals.
Recycling or proper disposal of materials at the end of their useful service
lives has become increasingly important in an age when we are conscious
of preserving resources and maintaining a clean and healthy environment.
For example, many new products, such as decking materials, picnic tables,
and even stylish interior panels are made from recycled HDPE (high￾density polyethylene). The proper treatment and disposal of toxic wastes
and materials is also a crucial consideration. Many CAD platforms provide
database tools for analyzing the impact of materials selections on the design
cost and its environmental impact.

selections during the modeling process. (Autodesk screen shots reprinted courtesy of Autodesk, Inc.)
10.10 Dimensional Accuracy and Surface Finish
Size, thickness, and shape complexity of the part have a major bearing on
the manufacturing process selected to produce it. Flat parts with thin cross
sections, for example, cannot be cast properly. Complex parts may be
formed easily and economically, but they may be cast or fabricated from
individual pieces.
Tolerances and surface finish obtained in hot-working operations cannot be
as good as those obtained in cold-working (room temperature) operations,
because dimensional changes, warpage, and surface oxidation occur during
processing at elevated temperatures. Some casting processes produce a
better surface finish than others because of the different types of mold
materials used and their surface finish.
The size and shape of manufactured products vary widely. For example, the
main landing gear for a twin-engine, 400-passenger Boeing 777 jetliner is 
4.3m(14 ′) high, with three axles and six wheels, made by forging and
machining processes (Figure 10.42). At the other extreme is the generation
of a 0.05 − mm(0.002 ′′) diameter hole at one end of a 
0.35 − mm(0.014 ′′) diameter needle, using a process called electrical￾discharge machining. The hole is burr-free and has a location accuracy of 
±0.003mm(0.0001 ′′).images

Another small-scale manufacturing example is given in Figure 10.43, which
shows microscopic gears as small as 100μm(0.004′′) in diameter. The
center gear is smaller than a human hair. These gears may be used in
applications such as powering microrobots to repair human cells,
microknives in surgery, and camera shutters for precise photography. Such
small-scale operations are called nanotechnology and nanofabrication
(“nano” meaning one billionth).
images

orange-colored gear in this colored scanning electron micrograph is smaller in diameter than a
human hair and 100 times thinner than a sheet of paper. The whole micromotor device was etched
into the surface of a wafer of silicon by the same techniques used to make silicon chips. (Alamy.)
Ultraprecision manufacturing techniques and machinery are now being
developed and are coming into more common use. For machining
mirrorlike surfaces, for example, the cutting tool is a very sharp diamond
tip, and the equipment has very high stiffness and must be operated in a
room where the temperature is controlled within 1°C. Highly sophisticated
techniques such as molecular-beam epitaxy and scanning-tunneling
microscopy are being implemented to obtain accuracies on the order of the
atomic lattice, ± 0.1 nm.10.11 Net-Shape Manufacturing
Because not all manufacturing operations produce finished parts, additional
operations may be necessary. For example, a forged part may not have the
desired dimensions or surface finish, so additional operations such as
machining or grinding may be necessary. Likewise, if it is difficult,
impossible, or economically undesirable to produce a part with holes using
just one manufacturing process, processes such as drilling may be needed.
In another example, the holes produced by a particular manufacturing
process may not have the proper roundness, dimensional accuracy, or
surface finish, creating a need for additional operations such as honing.
Finishing operations can contribute significantly to the cost of a product.
Consequently, the trend has been for net-shape manufacturing or near-net￾shape manufacturing. In net-shape or near-net-shape manufacturing, the
part is made as close to the final desired dimensions, tolerances, surface
finish, and specifications as possible. Typical examples of these methods
are near-net-shape forging and casting of parts, stamped sheet metal parts,
injection-molded plastics, and components made by powder metallurgy
techniques. Figure 10.44 shows a subassembly as originally designed (a),
the redesign for ease of assembly (b), and finally as designed for net-shape
manufacture as a single injection-molded part (c).

parts, the redesign shown in (b) made this part easier to assemble, but changing the design to (c), asingle plastic part, requires no assembly. (Courtesy of Tektronix.)
10.12 Computer-Integrated Manufacturing
The major goals of automation in manufacturing facilities are to integrate
various operations to improve productivity, increase product quality and
uniformity, minimize cycle times, and reduce labor costs. Since the 1940s,
automation has accelerated because of rapid advances in control systems for
machines and in computer technology.
Few developments in the history of manufacturing have had a more
significant impact than computers. Computers are now used in a very broad
range of applications, including control and optimization of manufacturing
processes, material handling, assembly, automated inspection and testing of
products, as well as inventory control and numerous management activities.
Beginning with computer graphics and computer-aided design and
manufacturing, the use of computers has been extended to computer￾integrated manufacturing (CIM). Computer-integrated manufacturing is
particularly effective because of its capability for
responsiveness to rapid changes in market demand and product
modification;
better use of materials, machinery, and personnel, and reduced inventory;
better control of production and management of the total manufacturing
operation; and
high-quality products at low cost.Major Applications of Computers in Manufacturing
Computer numerical control (CNC) is a method of controlling the
movements of machine components by direct insertion of coded
instructions in the form of numerical data. Numerical control was first
implemented in the early 1950s and was a major advance in the automation
of machines.
Adaptive control (AC) automatically adjusts the parameters in a
manufacturing process to optimize production rate and product quality, and
to minimize cost. Parameters such as forces, temperatures, surface finish,
and dimensions of the part are monitored constantly. If they move outside
the acceptable range, the system adjusts the process variables until the
parameters again fall within the acceptable range.
Industrial robots were introduced in the early 1960s, and they have been
replacing humans in operations that are repetitive, boring, and dangerous,
thus reducing the possibility of human error, decreasing variability in
product quality, and improving productivity. Robots with sensory
perception capabilities (intelligent robots) are being developed, with
movements that simulate those of humans.

10.45 Car Frames Being Welded on a Robotic Assembly Line (Jenson/Shutterstock.)Automated handling of materials, controlled by computers, has allowed
highly efficient handling of materials and products in various stages of
completion (work in progress), such as from storage to machine, from
machine to machine, and at the points of inspection, inventory, and
shipment.
Automated and robotic assembly systems are replacing costly assembly by
operators. Products are designed or redesigned so that they can be
assembled more easily by machine.
Computer-aided process planning (CAPP) is capable of improving
productivity in a plant by optimizing process plans, reducing planning
costs, and improving the consistency of product quality and reliability.
Functions such as cost estimating and work standards (time required to
perform a certain operation) can also be incorporated into the system.
Group technology (GT) groups products by classifying them into families,
according to similarities in design and similarities in manufacturing
processes to produce the part. In this way, part designs and process plans
can be standardized and families of parts can be produced efficiently and
economically.
Just-in-time (JIT) production tries to deliver supplies just in time to be
used, to produce parts just in time to be made into subassemblies and
assemblies, and to finish products just in time to be delivered to thecustomer. In this way, inventory carrying costs are low, part defects are
detected right away, productivity is increased, and high-quality products are
made at low cost.
Cellular manufacturing involves workstations, which are manufacturing
cells usually containing a central robot and several machines, each
performing a different operation on the part.
Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) integrate manufacturing cells into
a large unit, all interfaced with a central computer. Flexible manufacturing
systems have the highest level of efficiency, sophistication, and productivity
in manufacturing. Although costly, they are capable of producing parts
randomly and changing manufacturing sequences on different parts quickly;
thus, they can meet rapid changes in market demand for various types of
products.
Expert systems are basically intelligent computer programs. Expert systems
are being developed rapidly with capabilities to perform tasks and solve
difficult real-life problems as human experts would.
Artificial intelligence (AI) involves the use of machines and computers to
replace human intelligence. Computer-controlled systems are becoming
capable of learning from experience and making decisions that optimize
operations and minimize costs. Artificial neural networks, which are
designed to simulate the thought processes of the human brain, have thecapability of modeling and simulating production facilities, monitoring and
controlling manufacturing processes, diagnosing problems in machine
performance, conducting financial planning, and managing a company’s
manufacturing strategy.
10.13 Shared Manufacturing
Although large corporations can afford to implement current technology
and take risks, smaller companies generally have difficulty in doing so
owing to limited personnel, resources, and capital. More recently, the
concept of shared manufacturing has been proposed. This consists of a
regional or nationwide network of manufacturing facilities with state-of￾the-art equipment for training, prototype development, and small-scale
production runs to help small companies develop products that compete in
the global marketplace.
In view of these advances and their potential, some experts envision a
factory of the future in which production takes place with little or no direct
human intervention. Although the discussion remains highly controversial,
the human role in this system is expected to be confined to supervision,
maintenance, and upgrading of machines, computers, and software.
10.14 Manufacturing Methods and the DrawingIn designing a part, consider what materials and manufacturing processes
are to be used. These processes will determine the representation of the
detailed features of the part, the choice of dimensions, and the machining or
processing accuracy. The principal methods of metal forming are
Casting
Machining from standard stock
Welding
Forming from sheet stock
Forging
A knowledge of these processes, along with a thorough understanding of
the intended use of the part, will help determine some basic manufacturing
processes.
In sand casting, all cast surfaces remain rough textured, with all corners
filleted or rounded. Sharp corners indicate that at least one of the surfaces is
finished (i.e., machined further, usually to produce a flat surface), and finish
marks are shown on the edge view of the finished surface. Plastic parts are
similar in many ways to castings because they have filleted and rounded
corners and draft to allow the parts to be removed from the mold.
In drawings of parts machined from standard stock, most surfaces are
represented as machined. In some cases, as on shafting, the surface existing
on the raw stock is often accurate enough without further finishing. Cornersare usually sharp, but fillets and rounds are machined when necessary. For
example, an interior corner may be machined with a radius to provide
greater strength.
On welding drawings, several pieces are cut to size and welded together.
Welding symbols indicate the welds required. Generally, there are no fillets
and rounds except those generated during the welding process itself. Certain
surfaces may be machined after welding or, in some cases, before welding.
Notice that lines are shown where the separate pieces are joined.
On sheet metal drawings, the thickness of the material is uniform and is
usually given in the material specification note rather than by a dimension
on the drawing. Bend radii and bend reliefs at corners are specified
according to standard practice. For dimensions, either the decimal-inch or
metric dimensioning systems may be used. Allowances of extra material for
joints may be required when the flat blank size is being determined.
For forged parts, separate drawings may be made for the die maker and for
the machinist. The forging drawing provides only the information to
produce the forging, and the dimensions given are those needed by the die
maker. All corners are rounded and filleted and are shown as such on the
drawing. The draft is drawn to scale and is usually specified by degrees in a
note. A separate shop drawing for the machinist may be used to show the
locations and sizes of drilled holes and information for surface finishes.Industry Case
Modeling Sheet Metal Parts: Think Flat
When Stan McLean designs stainless steel sheet metal components
manufactured by Ability Fabricators, he uses the sheet metal module in
SolidWorks to model the multiple parts and optimize the fit of the various
components.
“Ability Fabricators, Inc. specializes in custom equipment, mostly for the
pharmaceutical and food industries,” McLean explains. “Projects can be
anything from fully automated equipment such as drum lifts and V￾Blenders, to cabinets and tables, to a simple bracket to support a sensor on a
bottling line. Modeling the complicated equipment involves inserting and
positioning motors, actuators, sensors, bearings, and linear guides in the
assembly, then building the required sheet metal brackets, supports, and
covers around the components.”
images
10.46 This is the 3D model of the cabinet and countertop to be fabricated from sheets of 14 gauge
stainless steel.
McLean usually has several files open at the same time as he works: the
assembly model, subassemblies, and the individual part model he is
working on. Each part in the assembly is stored in its own file and loaded
into the assembly. When creating new sheet metal parts, McLean takes botha “top down” and “bottom up” approach. Certain parts are created on their
own and then inserted into the assembly (bottom up design). Other sheet
metal parts are created directly in the assembly based on the position of the
various components (top down design).
With the individual components in place in the model, McLean can begin
modeling the sheet metal parts needed to hold them. “A sheet metal part is a
series of flanges or a box with various bends at various angles. I can sketch
a rectangle, dimension it, extrude it to the gauge of the sheet metal I’m
using, then add a flange by extruding another sketch—or by using the Insert
Flange command in the sheet metal module.” The sheet metal module
contains a series of tools that are specifically designed to create the unique
features of sheet metal parts, such as flanges, hem bends, sketched bends,
corner seams, and more.
To ensure that all parts fit together correctly, McLean often sketches the
base feature for a sheet metal part on one face of an existing component,
then adds flanges by sketching on surfaces of other parts. “I’m always
updating all of the parts in the assembly and modifying the sheet metal parts
to make sure everything comes together as required.”
When designing sheet metal structures such as the cabinet and countertop
shown here, McLean models the parts one face at time and validates them
in the assembly until it the part is complete. “By designing them one face ata time, I can adjust the faces as needed until everything is where it is
supposed to be.”
Sometime he creates subassemblies for single parts with multiple bodies to
create weldments where more than one part or bodies are welded together.
He adds regular fasteners or PEM fasteners (clinch nuts) to the assembly
model as needed to fasten the parts together. He can also use tools in the
sheet metal module to create lofted bends (for square to round transitions)
or cylindrical or conical sections. When he adds a split line on one side of a
complex form, Solidworks is capable of creating a flat pattern from the
model.
images
10.47 An exploded wireframe view of the assembly model.
The sheet metal module automatically creates and updates a flat pattern for
the part. The flat pattern is the last feature shown in the feature browser. It
can be toggled off and on as needed to display the flat pattern for
verification. The software also checks automatically for collisions in the flat
pattern.
McLean uses the sheet metal template in SolidWorks to carefully control
the sheet metal parameters such as bend allowance (K-factor), sheet metal
thickness, bend radius, corner relief, and other settings. He sets these valuesto make sure that the flat patterns calculated accurately reflect the real parts
produced in the shop.
images
10.48 Clinch nuts fasten the sheet metal parts together.
Sheet metal is defined by the gauge denoting its thickness and giving the
type of material and finish. For example, 14 gauge stainless steel is 0.078′′
thick. Sheets thicker than 3/16
′′
 are usually referred to as plate. Although
the tools in Solidworks are made for sheet metal, they work as well for
creating thicker plate parts that will be rolled or brake formed. The
thickness and gauge of the material affect the K-factor used to calculate the
bend allowance—the amount the flat pattern will be adjusted for bending—
and the location of the neutral line. Inside the neutral line the sheet metal
part is in compression and made slightly smaller during forming on a brake
press; outside the neutral line the metal is in tension and stretched. The
neutral line represents the boundary where the part is the same length in
both the flat and formed shape. Where the neutral line is on a given part is
based on the bend radius and the ductility of the material and is not directly
in the center of the bend.
Once the parts have been designed, McLean creates multiview, fully
dimensioned 2D drawings of the 3D sheet metal part and a bill of materials
for any fasteners it includes. Because the sheet metal parts will be cut with a
numerically controlled machine, McLean saves the flat pattern as a separate.dxf file that can be imported by the software they use to generate the NC
code for cutting the part. The result is a complete documentation drawing of
the folded part and an electronic file of the flat shape that can be used to cut
the shape from the sheet metal. Typical CNC machines for cutting sheet
metal are a laser cutter, plasma cutter, or CNC-controlled punch press.
Although the software speeds up the modeling of sheet metal parts, it does
not prevent the creation of impossible parts. “Because you’re creating this
bent-up enclosure, you have to think about the flat all the time,” says
McLean. “You can create a solid or sheet metal enclosure with flanges that,
when unfolded, will overlap each other. You also have to know how the
metal is going to be bent. If you have a part with several bends, and you do
them in the wrong order, you can get to a point where you can’t complete
the bend because the part will either hit the machine or hit the die.”
McLean’s manufacturing background helps him “think flat” and allows him
to optimize his designs in ways that others cannot. “Sometimes I look at a
flat pattern and the formed part and need to make changes to optimize the
fabrication. I also talk with the operators for the CNC laser cutter and press
brake to make sure I have made the right decisions.”
Short of manufacturing experience, however, McLean’s advice for sheet
metal parts is to “keep it simple.” “Instead of welding three parts together,
is it better to make a single, more complicated part? This is a trade-off with
no simple answer. The question is, Where are you actually saving? If youget to the point where a part has 10 to 15 bends in it, you’re probably better
off going to two parts and welding them together.”

10.15 Modeling for Testing and Refinement
The refinement phase forms an iterative loop with the analysis phase of
design. Test results feed back into model changes, and the revised model is
used for further testing. Your 3D solid model database defines the geometry
of the design and provides information for engineering analysis, such as
determining mass, volume, surface area, and moments of inertia.
You can use tools such as a spreadsheet, equation solver, motion simulator,
and finite element package with model data to check for stress
concentrations; determine deflections, shear forces, bending moments, heat
transfer properties, and natural frequencies; perform failure analysis and
vibration analysis; and make many other calculations.
10.16 Determining Mass PropertiesThe size, weight, surface area, and other properties available from a 3D
model are frequently part of the design criteria your design must satisfy.
The surface area of a part can determine whether a part cools as quickly as
it should. The volume of a molded part will determine how much material
is needed to fill the mold—which in turn determines a key component of
the manufacturing cost.
When a satellite or other space vehicle is designed, the mass of the finished
product is important for determining the thrust required for the vehicle to
leave Earth’s atmosphere. Accurate mass information can spell the
difference between success and failure and, for manned space flights, the
difference between life and death. At the same time, spacecraft designs seek
to minimize the total mass of the system, so the built-in factors of safety
cannot be as high as those for bridges built of heavy steel. When the margin
for error is small, the importance of accurate mass properties information is
even higher.
Calculating the mass of a model as complex as a satellite by hand is time￾consuming and might add years to the design process. Most 3D CAD
systems allow you to directly generate a wide range of mass property
information about the model.
The following are mass property calculations commonly available in CAD
modeling software:Volume
Centroid or center of gravity
Surface area
Moments of inertia
Mass
Radii of gyration
Acquiring mass properties information directly from the model provides
information that would be difficult to calculate accurately. Figure 10.50
shows the model of a bike brake assembly. Figure 10.53 on page 454 shows
the mass properties generated from the model. Modeling software can
report the volume of the part—regardless of its shape—with accuracies of
up to plus or minus one hundred-millionth of a percent (± 0.00000001).

Factors of Safety
A factor of safety expresses the ratio of two quantities, such as maximum
safe speed/expected operating speed or failure load for a part/expected
highest load in use, that will be used as a design guideline. For example, if
the failure load for a part is 250 pounds per square inch, and the expected
highest load in use is 125 pounds per square inch, the safety factor for the
part would be 2. Factors of safety for commercial aircraft are within the
range of 1.2 to 1.5. Factors of safety for elevators may be as high as 14. For
some types of equipment, such as that used in public buildings, codes
specify safety requirements that must be met. You should be familiar with
any codes or standards that apply to your design area.

Mass Properties of a Right Cylinder
You can learn more about using mass property calculations, such as
moments of inertia, in engineering courses. The equations and illustrations
in this example illustrate these properties as they would apply to a 1-inch
diameter right cylinder (a cylinder in which the base is perpendicular to the
height), shown in 10.51.For this example cylinder:
π is approximately 3.14
r = .5inch,thebase′sradius
d = 1inch,thebase′sdiameter
l = 2inches,theheightofthecylinder.
Volume
The volume of a solid is basically the amount of space it takes up; volume
is measured in cubic units. For many basic geometric solids, like a cylinder,
volume can be calculated using simple formulas. Complex shapes can be
calculated either by breaking them down into simpler geometric solids—
whose volumes are easier to calculate—and adding those volumes together
or by using calculus-based methods. CAD software usually uses
approximate methods to evaluate integrals to determine the volume and
mass properties of any shape.
v = volume
The volume of a 1-inch-diameter cylinder, in which the 2-inch length is
perpendicular to the circular base, is the area of the base times the length.
v = π × r
2 × l
= 3.14 × (.5in .)
2 × 2in.
= 1.57in.
3Surface Area
The surface area of a solid is the square measure of its exterior surface. It
is also the total area of the boundary surfaces of a solid or surface model.
You can think of the surface area as the measure of the exterior surface of
the object flattened out into a plane (as shown in 10.52). Once again, it is
easy to calculate for simple cases, but complex for irregular shapes. CAD
software usually uses approximate methods to evaluate integrals to
determine the surface area of any shape.
Sa = surfacearea
The surface area of the cylinder is the area of the rectangular shape that
encloses the cylinder (πd × l) plus the area of the two circular ends (πr)

.
Mass
The mass is roughly the measure of the resistance that an object has to
changing its steady motion.
Sa = πdl + 2 (πr

]
= 7.85in.
2Mass Density
Mass density for a given material is usually found by looking up the value
in an engineering materials table. This is typically information you provide
to calculate the mass for a given object. It is very important to make sure
the units for your model (millimeters or inches, for example) match the
units for the mass density that you provide (milligrams per cubic millimeter,
for example). If they do not, you must convert the volume value reported
from the software, or you will be off by a large factor in your calculations.
The mass of this cylinder, if made from copper, is its volume times the mass
density of the material, which is 0.295.
Centroid or Center of Gravity
A centroid is a point defining the geometric center of an object. The
centroid and center of gravity coincide when the part is made of a uniform
material in a parallel gravity field. Most CAD software reports the centroid
relative to the coordinate system that is selected. Make sure that you
understand how the coordinate system is oriented when interpreting this

3value. Approximations of double integrals are used by the CAD software to
calculate centroids.
C = centroid
The centroid for the cylinder is stated in terms of the three axes of the 3D
coordinate system. Given the location of the origin at the center of one end
of the cylinder, the centroid for this part is at (1,0,0) inches.
Moments of Inertia
A moment of inertia is the measure of the resistance that an object has to
changing its steady motion about an axis. A moment of inertia depends on
the mass of the object and how that mass is distributed about the axis of
interest. A moment of inertia is the second moment of mass of the object
relative to the axis. Products of inertia are similar to moments of inertia, but
they describe the mass distribution relative to two axes of interest. Make
sure you understand how the coordinate system is oriented when
interpreting this value.

For this cylinder,
Radii of Gyration
The radius of gyration is the distance from the axis of interest where all the
mass can be concentrated and still produce the same moment of inertia.
Make sure you understand how the coordinate system is oriented when
interpreting this value.

software, it is important to understand how the values are derived.

mModeling methods, algorithms, system variables, and units used by your
CAD software make a difference in the accuracy of mass property
calculations. For example, models that store the faceted representation of
the part may produce less accurate calculations than models that store the
accurate geometry.
Different modeling software uses different algorithms to calculate the
volume of a solid. Some of them have error ranges of plus or minus 20%.
One algorithm used to calculate the volume of a solid simply encloses the
solid in a bounding box, then breaks it up into rectangular prisms parallel to
the bounding box. (A bounding box is the smallest box inside which the
solid will fit.) The lengths of the rectangular prisms are determined by the
surface boundaries of the solid. The volumes of the prisms are then summed
to find the volume of the solid. The accuracy of this method depends on the
number of subdivisions into which the object is broken. The direction from
which the prisms are created also affects the ability of the prisms to
approximate the shape. Typically, both these settings are variables with
ranges that you can set prior to calculating the mass properties.
Other systems use an iterative process to approximate the integral that
describes the volume. These systems often let you specify a range of
accuracy for the calculations. The more accurate you require the
calculations to be, the more time they will take.
Verifying AccuracyA good way to verify the results you are getting for mass properties is to
model a shape in which the geometry is known (such as the 1-inch-diameter
cylinder used in the preceding example), then compare the properties
calculated by hand with those given by the CAD system. Use your CAD
software to model the cylinder shown in Figure 10.54: it has a diameter of 1
inch and a height of 2 inches. Calculate the volume by hand using the
formula.
images

Then, list the same information from your solid modeling software. Is it the
same? A modeler that stores an accurate representation, such as AutoCAD
2023 (Figure 10.54), will yield different results from one such as AutoCAD
Release 12, which used faceted models and an approximate method to
calculate volumes (Figure 10.55).
images
10.55 The faceted models stored by AutoCAD Release 12, as shown here, produce a less accurate
volume calculation than the more accurate form of the model stored by AutoCAD 2023.

= 1.57in.
3Even after checking the results with a simple object, you should routinely
estimate the values for your models to make sure that the computed values
from your system are reasonable. If there is a significant difference between
the software report and your hand calculation, take time to determine what
is producing the variation. Do not just believe the values reported by the
software and base important decisions on those results. (There is a tendency
to think the software values are right because they are printed neatly on the
screen. Make sure you understand the values and their range of accuracy
before you use them.)
Units and Assumptions
Some information reported under mass properties, such as the centroid,
moments, and radii of gyration, is related to the coordinate system in which
the model is stored or to a coordinate system you have selected. You must
make sure that you understand the model orientation with respect to the
coordinate system, or you may misinterpret the numbers reported.
Spotlight
Pounds Mass versus Pounds Force
Don’t confuse pounds mass with pounds force when using U.S. units. An
object on Earth that has a mass of 1 pound also has a weight of 1 pound. If
you send that object to the moon, where the gravitational force is about onesixth what it is on Earth, the object will still have 1 pound mass; however,
its weight in pounds will be about one sixth of what it weighed on Earth.
Mass equals weight divided by gravitational acceleration (m = W/gc).
The type of units specified or assumed is especially important in calculating
mass properties. Using mismatched types of units is a common reason mass
property values may not match your expected values. The common unit
systems in the United States are the inch-pound-second (ips) and foot￾pound-second (fps) systems. Elsewhere, the Système International (SI) is
used, with meters, kilograms, and seconds (mks) as the basic units, although
the centimeter-gram-second (cgs) system is also sometimes used, and
machine parts are often modeled using millimeters. You must make sure
that you understand the units that are used in the calculation of the mass
properties.
Tip
Preparing for Mass Property Calculations
Check the accuracy of your modeler by calculating values for a simple
part by hand.
Routinely estimate the values you expect and compare them with the
modeler’s results.Be sure the units used for a calculation are consistent with your model
units.
Note the coordinate system orientation used in certain calculations.
Set materials properties for each part, taking care that units used fit your
needs.
Confirm the density used for materials in your modeler: does it use a
default value?
10.17 Exporting Data from the Database
In some cases, mass properties information provided by the solid model is
enough to determine whether a key criterion is met; in other cases, the
information from the model needs to be analyzed further or combined with
additional information. The surface area of a model, for example, can be
used with an estimate of paint per square foot to gauge the amount and cost
of paint required.
Most solid and parametric modeling software allows you to export a wide
range of data from the CAD database so it can be used in other applications.
Mass properties data are commonly exported to text files that can be read
by a spreadsheet, for example. Parameter data and the geometry of the
model itself can also be exported to be used in other applications.
Conversely, parameter information can be imported into constraint-based
modeling software from spreadsheets or other analysis tools.To use your CAD database with other applications, you should be aware of
how data are transferred from one application to the other. Before selecting
a particular CAD platform, you should investigate the export formats that
are available and make sure that you can successfully transfer the
information between the different software packages you may be using.
Export a test part first to be sure the conversion will suit your needs. If you
want to bring the data back into your CAD database from another
application, this testing is even more important. Do not leave this testing to
the last minute when you may be facing a critical deadline.
File Formats
Each software application has its own native file format. A native format is
designed to store any and all information created with that application in an
efficient form. Each application has its own codes stored with the data that
are interpreted by the application when the file is opened. For this reason,
file formats are identified by an extension. Microsoft Word, for example,
creates .docx (or .doc) files. AutoCAD’s native format is .dwg. If you try to
open a .docx file in a different application—and do not get an error message
—you may see strange characters on the screen. These are elements in the
file used by Word that the other application does not know how to interpret.
Other file formats are standardized so they can be read by many different
applications. A text-only or ASCII file (which often uses a .txt extension)
uses nothing more than the standard 256 ASCII characters (the older ASCIIstandard had only 128 characters). ASCII is an acronym for American
Standard Code for Information Interchange, an early standard that allows
data to be shared reliably among all different kinds of computers. Each
letter of the alphabet plus other common characters are coded the same way
on any machine that reads and writes text files. If you have ever saved a
formatted word processing document as a text file, you know that it does
not save special formatting (such as bold and italic) or any graphics in the
file. It does, however, create a copy of the words in your document that can
be read on any computer.
Tip
Text-based tools and formats enabled the growth of the Internet and the
World Wide Web. The HTML language used on the Web is a text-only
format designed to allow formatted text and graphics to be displayed from
a text-based file.
Today, most software applications have filters that allow them to write or
read nonnative file formats. These may be standardized formats, or they
may be the native formats of other popular packages. AutoCAD’s .dwg
format, for example, can be read by many applications that make it easy for
their users to work with these files.
Sometime, changing to a different format causes a loss of data—either in
the new format or when you reconvert the data back into a form readable byyour CAD software. You can never increase the amount of information in a
file by translating it; you can only keep it the same or decrease it.
Common Formats for Export
Export formats for CAD data depend on what you are exporting. If you are
exporting mass property data, attribute data, or dimension parameters, the
export options offer a choice of formats, most of which are text-based.
Some CAD packages export data to common spreadsheet formats, such as
Microsoft Excel’s .xls (or .xlsx) format. Almost all CAD software offers
text export as an option.
When you export a table of data as text, you will commonly choose among
comma-delimited, space-delimited, or tab-delimited text (see Figure 10.56).
Tables of data are generally exported so that each record (or row of data in a
table) is separated by a line break (signaling the software to go to the next
line). Columns of data are separated (delimited) by a character—a space,
comma, or tab. When the text file is read by the target application, you may
have to specify which character was used to delineate the columns. If your
data entries have many spaces in them, space-delimited would be a bad
choice, as the target software would not be able to distinguish between the
spaces in the entries and those between the columns. Tab-delimited is the
most commonly used export format for tabular data. The comma-delimited
format is also popular for importing to and exporting from CAD software.images images images
10.56 (a) Spreadsheet Showing the Parameter Data for the Brake Part Exported from
Pro/ENGINEER. The parameter data text file is shown exported in (b) comma-delimited text format
and (c) tab-delimited text format.
If you plan to export your CAD model for analysis, to generate NC tool
paths, or to do animation or kinematic analysis, you may need to use some
kind of graphics exchange format. These are standardized formats that
capture graphics information in the same way that a text file captures text
data. Each varies in the degree to which it captures the information in the
model. The required accuracy for graphical data can also vary between
graphics standards. This can be a problem because endpoints of lines that
may have been considered connecting in one CAD package, where the
accuracy indicates that endpoints connect if they are within 0.000001, may
not connect when exported to a format that uses accuracies of
0.0000000001. The new format may not know how to interpret this
difference in accuracy. The result may be that lines that previously
connected no longer connect when translated.
The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) is a graphics format
capable of exporting wireframe, surface, or solid information. This format
captures the 3D information and is commonly used to export the model for
computer-aided manufacturing. It was developed to export engineering
drawing data, with emphasis on the 2D and 3D wireframe model
information, text, dimensions, and limited surface information typical of
early CAD-drawn mechanical parts. The IGES standard is controlled by theNational Computer Graphics Association (NCGA). The NCGA administers
the National IGES User Group (NIUG), which provides access to
information on IGES. The volunteer organization IGES/PDES (Product
Data Exchange using STEP) helps maintain the evolving IGES standard
and publishes a specification for IGES. Because it is evolving, there are
various versions of IGES in existence, with various capabilities. Because
IGES has capabilities for exporting a wide variety of information, different
flavors of it exist. You can often select options for how you want the
information translated. You can find references on the Web that list the
types of entities and how the information for them is stored in the IGES
standard. A segment from an IGES file is shown in Figure 10.57.
images
10.57 The IGES standard defines and codes entities in the CAD database using only comma- and
space-delimited ASCII characters arranged in a standard format.
The STandard for the Exchange of Product model data (STEP) is another
3D format that was agreed on more recently by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO). STEP may eventually allow more
information to be transferred between CAD platforms than IGES.
Autodesk’s Drawing Exchange Format (DXF) is popular for exporting 2D
and 3D geometry between CAD platforms.
The STereo Lithography (STL) format is used to export 3D geometry to
rapid prototyping systems. STL format translates the surface of the objectinto triangular facets. The size and number of these facets determine how
accurately the STL file matches the original object (see Figure 10.58).

STL format. The enlarged view in (c) shows the faceted appearance of the rounded end in this file

Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data
The STEP standard was developed by ISO to provide a format for
representing and exchanging computer-readable product data. The initiative
provides a neutral mechanism for describing product data throughout the
life cycle of a product—not just its design, but also its manufacture, use,
maintenance, and disposal. This means that the standard not only provides a
neutral file format for exchange of 3D model information but also addresses
additional product information such as that handled by a variety of database
systems or a product data management (PDM) system. U.S. industry is
represented in the process by PDES, a voluntary activity coordinated by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (www.nist.gov).
Native versus Neutral FormatsMany CAD systems now allow you to read the native format file from
another CAD system. This usually preserves the maximum amount of
information in the translated file. When a native format is not available,
only a more general format such as IGES may be available. These general
formats are sometimes referred to as neutral files. Neutral files are useful
both for exporting data and for importing files that have been created on a
system other than your own.
Vector versus Raster Data
Graphics programs are generally of two main types: raster or vector. CAD
systems use vector-type data. This means that the information stored in the
database contains the endpoints of lines, centers, radii of arcs, and other
information based on the geometry of the objects. The CAD software draws
a particular entity on the screen based on this vector information. The
definition of the entities allows them to be drawn, printed, or converted to
any size or format. All the previously mentioned graphics formats are used
to exchange vector-type information.
Raster graphics programs (such as Photoshop) store information about the
discrete pixels, or dots, that make up an image. Because this information is
stored “dot by dot,” it cannot contain useful information about the
individual entities in the image, such as the center of a circle. Some
examples of these formats are .bmp, .pcx, .tif, .png, .jpg, and .gif. These
formats contain the information about the color and intensity of the pixelsthat should be formed to display the image. Images produced by scanning a
picture or document are raster-type images. You cannot directly scan a
drawing and use it in a vector-based CAD program. First, its raster-type
information must be converted to vector information using a conversion
algorithm. This is often unreliable, because the connectivity of endpoints,
line types, and other information can be difficult to translate.
Many vector-type CAD programs allow you to export and import raster￾type images. For example, a shaded model may be exported to a raster
format, as in Figure 10.59, for printing or inclusion in a text document.
Conversely, a scanned image, such as a company logo, or picture of an
actual part, may be imported and placed in a vector drawing. Raster data in
the CAD drawing remain a set of pixels; the entities in the drawing cannot
be edited individually.
images
10.59 This enlarged view of the raster image shows that it is made of pixels, not editable points,
lines, and arcs.
10.18 Downstream Applications
As the CAD model has evolved from a 2D drawing to a 3D database of
design information, other software packages have evolved to facilitate
engineering analysis of product and system design. These downstream
applications may use data already created for the solid model. Increasingly,
extensions for CAD packages offer analysis tools that operate within the 3Dmodeler so you don’t have to define the model in another format. In this
section, you will learn about analysis software that uses information from
the CAD database.
Spreadsheets
You are probably already familiar with spreadsheets. Values, text, and
equations are entered into cells arranged in rows and columns. Each cell can
be defined to store text and numeric data or to store the results of an action
on data stored in other cells. Most spreadsheets offer a wide range of built￾in functions—from finding a simple sum to more complex mathematical
functions. Advanced users can create sophisticated problem-solving tools
using spreadsheets, but a spreadsheet is handy for any kind of calculation.
Spreadsheets are an easy way to do “what-if” analysis. Once relationships
have been set up, it is easy to change values and test many different
scenarios with little effort. This ability to evaluate, modify, and reevaluate is
integral to the iterative process of engineering design. The rows and
columns make it easy to check the calculations done by the spreadsheet and
easy to see results.
Many constraint-based modelers allow you to link the driven dimensions of
the model to spreadsheet cells. Thus, you can use the spreadsheet to
evaluate different options and then update the model dimensions based on
the results.Spreadsheets are an extremely helpful engineering tool not only for
calculations but also for projecting and keeping track of costs. Creating
parts that can be manufactured cost effectively and on time is an important
aspect of design.
Equation Solvers
Equation-solving software, such as MathCAD and Matlab, is used to solve
simultaneous equations and to visualize the results using built-in graphing
functions. Equation solvers, like spreadsheets, allow you to change values
easily and run different cases, but they also allow you to run a range of
values to select an optimum solution from among several solutions. Their
ability to optimize a solution makes them a valuable tool.
MathCAD’s interface uses a standard notation, so you can type equations in
the MathCAD editor the way you would ordinarily write them on paper.
Most symbolic computation software lets you manipulate numbers,
symbols, and math and logic expressions in a similar way.
You export data for use in an equation solver in the same way you would
for a spreadsheet. In the example in Figure 10.60, information for the tank
modeled was exported and loaded into MathCAD, where the convective
heat loss for the tank was calculated from the surface area.
images images10.60 The assembly model of the tank in (a) gives the combined mass properties of the tank and the
fluid, which are different materials. Using the combined mass properties allows you to calculate the
convective heat loss more accurately (b).
Spotlight
Exporting from the Model for Cost Estimates
Model information, such as dimensions and surface area for the tank shown
in Figure 10.61, was exported to a file named tank3.pls (shown in Figure
10.62).
images
10.61 Tank Model
images
10.62 Tank Parameters
This file was then imported into a spreadsheet (tank inf file.xlsx) to use the
values for estimating the cost of producing the tank.
A second spreadsheet, costs.xlsx, shown in Figure 10.63, was created to
multiply cost estimates for weld lengths, materials, and other information
by the quantities and values in the tank data.
images images
10.63 The parameters from the tank were used to calculate cost information in Microsoft Excel, as
shown in (a). The formulas used in the spreadsheet are visible in the view of the same spreadsheetshown in (b). Note that the formulas in cells B2–B4 and B6 relate directly to data in the tank inf
file.xlsx, the spreadsheet into which the tank data were imported. If updated tank parameters are
exported and imported into a new version of the tank inf file, the calculations in costs.xlsx will be
updated with this new information.
Once the calculations are complete, the same spreadsheet data can be used
to produce a report, graph the costs, or recalculate the estimate based on
updated cost or tank data.
Finite Element Analysis
Finite element analysis (FEA) is a method of breaking up a complex shape
into discrete smaller parts (finite elements) for which properties such as
stress (see Figure 10.64), strain, temperature distribution, fluid flow, and
electric and magnetic fields can more easily be found. The collective results
for these smaller elements are linked together to determine the overall
solution for the complex shape. The combination of smaller elements
needed to cover a 2D or 3D shape is called a mesh. Many finite element
analysis programs are available that can use CAD model geometry as the
basis for FEA mesh.
images

applied to the model. (Courtesy of Santa Cruz Bicycles.)
Some FEA software is linked to or runs inside the CAD interface. For
example, Creo Simulation (which has replaced Pro/Mechanica) is availablein Pro/ENGINEER; SolidWorks Simulation is available within the
SolidWorks interface. Other FEA software requires you to import or build
your CAD model in the FEA software. Many FEA programs, such as
ANSYS, will directly read CAD models from some of the more popular 3D
software. Most FEA software will also import CAD geometry from neutral
formats such as IGES, STEP, or DXF.

link arm indicate sections that will fatigue soonest. (Image courtesy of ©2016 Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks

Meshing the Model
Selecting the proper element type when forming the mesh is essential to
getting accurate results from the FEA program. Element types are shapes
that will be used to make the mesh (see Figure 10.65). The choice of
element type will depend on a number of factors, such as the material for
the part, its geometric properties, and anticipated load.
images
10.65 The mesh on the left is composed of one type of element, while the mesh on the right employs
different element types to reduce processing time. A finer mesh is used where higher stresses are
expected, but fewer elements where stress changes are more gradual. (Image credit: COMSOL.)
A good understanding of material properties is necessary when using FEA
methods. Material properties affect the appropriateness of the finite elementtype for your purposes. One property of a material is its elasticity. Only the
simplest finite element types represent materials as entirely elastic. Most
have capabilities that go far beyond simple elastic behavior. The element
shape used in the mesh can determine how the material behavior is
modeled. Some elements are used to represent elastic materials and small
strain; some are elastic and include large strains; some are plastic; some are
viscoelastic. Some elements even allow for coupled behavior. For example,
temperature and stress can be coupled for thermoelastic problems in which
temperature affects stress and vice versa. Similarly, electric current and
stress couple for piezoelectric materials in which an electric current causes
stress and vice versa. You must understand the range of material behavior
likely to be encountered and select an appropriate element type to get good
results from FEA analysis (see Figure 10.66).
images
10.66 This color plot shows the buckling of a plastic bottle in which the sides collapse from a
negative internal pressure. This linear buckling model was created in ANSYS. The geometry is from a
sample Autodesk Inventor part. (lmage courtesy ANSYS, Inc.)
Most modern finite element types have automatic mesh generation. The
quality of your FEA results also depends on the quality (or refinement) of
the mesh. For example, regions where stress gradients are steep require a
finer mesh to give good results. For symmetrical parts, where results will be
the same on both sides of the axis of symmetry, time can be saved by
cutting the model in half (or quarter) and analyzing only a portion of it. Thiskeeps the file size and computation time down, which is particularly
important when generating fine meshes.
After the mesh has been created, you use the FEA software to enter the
forces. Determining how to represent the forces on the object as they are
applied to the mesh is another important consideration.
FEA software cannot tell when your assumptions, element type, or mesh
density is not right for the problem you are analyzing. It will produce some
type of result, but you must have the engineering background to interpret
the validity of the result.

Analyzing the Brake Assembly
The brake assembly in Figure 10.67 shows CAD data being used for FEA
analysis. The brake arms are attached to the bike frame and to each other at
the pivot point. Brake pads attach at the slots on each arm. In this example,
Mechanica was used to analyze the brake arms to ensure that the arms can
withstand the braking forces while still providing flexibility needed for
smooth braking.

this surface is used to attach the brake arms to the bike frame. This still
allows the rotational motion of the arm during the analysis. Mechanica lets
you select an entire region (surface) to use, then constrains the nodes at
each point in the selected region of the mesh automatically. Figure 10.68
shows where constraints are applied to the left brake arm model.

10.68 Constraints are applied to the part named BRAKE_ARM_A to represent the boundary
conditions.
imagesNext, loads are added to the model. The arrows pointing away
from the selected regions in Figure 10.69 represent the applied loads that
result when the brake cable pulls upward on the end of the brake arm, and
the brake pad pushes against the wheel. (All the brake pad forces have not
been shown here for easier visualization.)

10.69 Loads are applied representing the actions of the brake cable and pads.
imagesThe type of element that will be used to form the mesh is set using
the AutoGEM dialog box. Each element type has strengths and weaknesses
for modeling particular features and material conditions. Figure 10.70
shows options that influence the mesh that will be generated automaticallyfor the element type. In this case, the tetrahedron element type is selected
for use with solids.

into a dialog box.
Tip
Pay close attention to units during any type of analysis. When values are
input, make sure the units match the requested input as well as the units
used in your model.
imagesNext, the material properties for the part are specified (if this has
not already been done during modeling). In this case, AL 6061 has been
chosen from a list of predefined materials (dialog box not shown.)
Mechanica’s automatic mesh creation function fits a mesh to the part
similar to that shown in Figure 10.71.
images
10.71 The mesh breaks the part into elements that can be analyzed as discrete solvable parts.
imagesNow the model is ready for setting up the analysis (Figure 10.72).
Mechanica uses a method called interpolating polynomials (P-elements) to
solve for the results. Instead of refining the model by increasing the meshdensity, using P-elements allows the mesh to remain the same, and the order
of the interpolating polynomial for the element is increased. The hotter
colors shown in Figure 10.71 represent areas where higher polynomial
orders are used.
images
10.72 Setting Up the Analysis
imagesIn this case von Mises effective stress analysis was selected
because it analyzes the combined results of stresses in all the different
directions. This means that the analysis combines the various shear and
normal stresses, then represents them as a single stress that you can relate to
material properties. This is useful for determining maximum loading.
Next, the analysis is run and the results verified. Figure 10.73 shows the
results of a quick check analysis. Hot colors (such as orange) are used to
represent higher stresses. Cool colors (such as blue) represent lower
stresses. Figure 10.74 shows a more refined analysis. The quick check
might be used for base testing, but it is unlikely to yield useful analytical
results.

Simulation Software
Simulation software allows you to simulate the function of a mechanism or
mechanical system using rules that define how the parts will behave. Once
you have modeled the mechanism’s behaviors accurately you can set the
simulation into motion to see how the model will behave under different
conditions or in response to different inputs. Most simulations provide a
visual representation of the action as well as numerical data about key
behaviors. The ability to inspect the behavior of the device or system
visually is a tool you can use to test designs early on—before prototyping—
and to get a feel for how they will work. The data generated by the
simulation can be used to assess how well the design meets criteria for the
project. A simple 2D example is the four-bar linkage shown in Figure
10.75.
images
10.75 This four-bar linkage was modeled in a 2D version of Working Model.
Many 3D modelers today offer a motion analysis feature that allows you to
see and measure a mechanical device in action. Adams and Working Model
3D are two simulation software packages that can work with the CAD data.
Other simulation software exists for specific purposes such as wind tunnelsimulations and manufacturing simulations. The broad term simulation can
be applied to any program that reasonably mimics the behavior of a system.
In mechanical design, simulations can be especially effective in the area of
kinematics, or the study of motion. Figure 10.76 shows a virtual prototype
of a wind turbine simulated in MSC Software’s Adams Multiphysics
software. Although parts may be rotated through a range of motion in the
CAD assembly model, simulating complex interactions among parts in an
assembly may be accomplished better in a dedicated kinematics package.
images
10.76 Simulation allows manufacturers to design better performing and more reliable systems by
predicting how wind turbines will behave throughout their lifecycle. (Courtesy of MSC Software Corporation.)
In most cases, the CAD model can be imported directly or after being
exported to a .dxf, STEP, or IGES file. Once the model is imported, part and
assembly constraints are further constrained to model the kind of action
allowed. Degrees of freedom define the directions in which a part can
move. Materials and their properties are assigned to each part in the
assembly (either in the CAD model or in the simulation software), as are
motors and power sources. The appropriate forces are applied to the model,
and other environmental settings (such as gravity) can be set to simulate
action on the moon or in space.
Once the 3D model has been built, more complex analysis can be
completed. The CAD model becomes a “virtual prototype” after joints andconstraints are applied. In motorcycle design, for example, stability and
safety of the design are a function of how the torque and stress induced by
acceleration are handled by the vehicle. A designer can test the vehicle as if
it were a real prototype and take accurate measurements of torque and
tension. Variations on the design can be tested as the design is optimized.
In the example in Figure 10.77, robot actions are simulated in a 3D virtual
world where process parameters critical to achieving system requirements
are easy to visualize. For example, the transparent walls that define the
working area of the robot are not visible in the real world, but they define
the robot’s work envelope in a way that is easy to understand. System users
modify the virtual walls (and other parameters) and use ROBOGUIDE to
optimize the performance of the system (Figure 10.78). The optimized
parameters and motion paths can then be downloaded to the real robot
system.
images
10.77 In these images, FANUC’s ROBOGUIDE software is being used to validate high-speed
picking and placing of parts by the robots shown. In the simulation, parts flow randomly into the
robot work cell at 300 parts per minute. Multiple robots share the material-handling pick process
and then place the parts into an outfeed packaging container. In the bottom figure, you can see the
virtual transparent walls that define the working area of the robot. (Courtesy of FANUC America Corporation.)
images
10.78 Using metrics provided by FANUC’s ROBOGUIDE, you can analyze and understand the
result of process modifications. You can make changes to the simulated system and evaluate the result
before implementing it in the real world. Changes to process parameters result in changes to
characteristics such as motion cycle time and process throughput. The images above show detailedrobot cycle time and process throughput information available in the software. (Courtesy of FANUC
America Corporation.)
When a simulation has been created directly from a CAD model, any
change to the CAD model can automatically update the simulation. This
interaction makes it even easier to use the simulation to guide the iterative
process of design.
Human Factors
Human factors analysis considers how people will interact with a design.
As you are designing, consider the qualities of the users of the system or
product. Human populations have general characteristics, such as average
height and language, that may affect their ability to use or operate the
device you are designing. Operator visibility (see Figure 10.79), the
complexity of the controls, and the ability of the operator to correctly map a
control to its function are all ergonomic considerations. In addition, you
also need to consider the people who will assemble, service, and repair the
product. You can use your CAD model to help determine the sizes for
access openings, critical distances that affect users’ reach, and other
important information for usability.

10.79 This view through the pilot’s eyes illustrates the ability of the pilot to see the runway from the
airplane cockpit. Operator visibility is an important factor in meeting safety requirements as well as
functional goals. (Courtesy of NexGen Ergonomics, Inc., www.nexgenergo.com.)A variety of software products work with the CAD data to test human
factors. The CAD model can be imported into the software, or human
models can be imported into the CAD environment to see how they fit with
the model (shown in Figure 10.80). NexGen’s HumanCAD software models
typical humans from 11 different populations, including databases of human
sizes such as 1988 Natick US Army and NASA-STD-3000. These
populations provide a range of ethnic groups, size percentiles, body types,
ages, cultures, and gender that you can then fit with your CAD model to see
how different categories of people might interact with the design. The
library includes typical predefined body and hand positions, linked for
realistic human motion ranges, that you can import and export among your
design software using common file formats. It even provides physically
challenged mannequins that you can use to test accessibility. You can also
use mannequin software to “see” the view from the mannequin’s eyes as it
moves along a path that you define, and to simulate lifting, pushing, and
pulling by adding forces and torque in any direction on any body part.

10.80 Human Models. Models can be added to your CAD models to test human interactions using
inverse and forward kinematics as well as to test reach, vision, and other criteria. Different hand
tools can be evaluated for gripping and posture by simply importing them. (Courtesy of NexGen Ergonomics,
Inc., www.nexgenergo.com.)
Testing with a variety of virtual human sizes allows you to determine
whether production line employees or machine operators can safely work
by determining what they can see or reach (Figure 10.81) . A variety ofergonomic analysis tools also enable you to analyze lifting, pushing,
pulling, and other tasks in a virtual environment.

Integrated Modeling and Design Software
The iterative nature of design refinement is fueling software tools that will
allow the design to be modeled and analyzed in one software environment.
Many analysis packages already provide tools that make it easier to
alternate between the analysis package and the CAD model.
Design rules that can be used for design optimization have also generated a
closer link between constraint-based modelers and equation solvers. Using
design rules to automate the optimization and/or creation of model
geometry has been successfully used at Boeing in the design of certain
aspects of the fuselage system for commercial aircraft. The central fuselage
of the Boeing 777, for example, is made of 50 skin panels, each of which
contains more than four hundred parts. These four hundred–plus parts are
the framework to which the aircraft’s “skin” is attached. Each frame,
stringer, stringer clip, and shear tie, illustrated in Figure 10.82, is very
similar to the next one, but not exactly the same. Each is modeled
individually because each may vary in the holes added to accommodate
wiring, fasteners, and so on. Each is also individually designed to weigh aslittle as possible. Chemical milling is used to remove all unnecessary
material from each part to reduce the weight of the aircraft. Rule-based
design has eliminated much of the work of modeling these 20,000 parts.
The Boeing knowledge-based engineering system uses both design rules
and manufacturing rules to ensure that each part is structurally sound and
optimized for weight (Figure 10.83). For example, one design rule is that
chemical milling to reduce the thickness of the part must stop .75 inch from
a hole in the part. This ensures that the strength of the area around the
attachment will not be compromised. Manufacturing rules are derived from
the limits of the manufacturing process used to remove excess weight. No
part may be designed that cannot be milled. The parameters defining each
feature of the part are evaluated against these rules both to optimize the
design and to automate much of the part creation.
images
10.82 Design and manufacturing rules for the many similar parts in the aircraft fuselage were used
to create a system that would automate much of the part modeling in CATIA, Boeing’s 3D modeling
system. The structural framework is visible in the assembly model of the fuselage in (a); the system of
frames, stringers, stringer clips, and shear ties used to support the skin is illustrated in (b). (Copyright

As you use your CAD database for analysis in downstream applications you
should familiarize yourself with the options being developed that canfacilitate the exchange of information among packages and the use of
analytical tools in design refinement.

Getting Easier Being Green
SolidWorks Sustainability is a module that provides life cycle assessment
(LCA) within the SolidWorks user interface. It gives you information about
environmentally friendly options for your engineering design decisions.
This software allows you to conduct life cycle analyses of parts and
assemblies. You can use it to see the environmental impact in terms of air,
carbon, energy, and water.
To see if you improve your design’s environmental impact as you modify it,
you can capture the existing baseline, then track how your new design
compares. The Find Similar Material dialog box shown lets you search the
material database for alternative materials based on their mechanical
properties. As you choose them you can visually assess the magnitude and
direction of their environmental impact with the charts in the panel at the

No matter how accurate your CAD model, it is never exactly the same as
the manufactured part. Traditionally, building a prototype was the best way
to ensure that a design could be manufactured and that it would operate as
desired when it was built. Today, the information in the 3D solid modeling
database changed the role of the physical prototype in two key ways: it has
made it possible to simulate a prototype with the 3D model, and it has made
it faster and cheaper to create a physical prototype than ever before.
A simulated prototype—often referred to as a virtual prototype—can serve
many of the purposes of a physical model.
The same information in the CAD database can also be used to direct rapid
prototyping processes that generate physical models relatively
inexpensively.
Rapid Prototyping
Rapid prototyping (RP) systems let you create a prototype directly from a
CAD design within minutes or hours instead of the days or weeks it might
otherwise take.
What is it worth to the design process to have an actual part that people can
hold in their hands? As a visualization tool and a means for checking the fit
with other parts, a physical model is a valuable aid in reducing the time ittakes a company to develop a product idea from a sketch to a product that is
available in the marketplace. Approximately 10% of all manufacturing and
design shops spend over $100,000 each year for prototypes. The resulting
confidence in the design and improved ability to communicate with the
customer about the design in an understandable way is an important
advantage of rapid prototyping. Rapid tooling processes use the same 3D
CAD information to produce molds and other tooling that can reduce the
time to market even further.
Rapid prototypes are especially useful for prototypes of complex molded
parts. Molds for fairly simple plastic parts can cost from $20,000 to
$50,000, making them prohibitively expensive to create just for checking a
design appearance. With rapid prototyping, single parts can be produced in
a matter of hours and used to verify the design. In addition, complex shapes
can be created as easily as simpler ones.
Despite its advantages over traditional processes, rapid prototyping is not
lightning fast. A part that is 2 × 3 × 1 inch may take an hour or longer to
create. However, the time does not usually depend on the complexity of the
part, just the size and accuracy built into the prototype file, and the type of
process used. Parts that would ordinarily have to be molded or cast can be
created in the same amount of time required for a rectangular block of about
the same dimensions. The complexity of each slice does not have much
effect on the time needed to create the part. Although a rectangular block is
easy to manufacture using traditional machining methods, the buckle shownin Figure 10.84 is a good candidate for rapid prototyping because of its
complex shape.
images
10.84 Complex molded shapes can be prototyped cost effectively with rapid prototyping systems.
Translating the Model
Rapid prototyping systems all work on a similar principle: they slice the
CAD model into thin layers, then create the model layer by layer from a
material that can be fused to the next layer until the entire part is realized.
To send a CAD file to most rapid prototyping systems, you usually export a
file in the STL file format. This file type was developed to export CAD data
to an early rapid prototyping system. Since then, it has become the de facto
standard for exporting CAD data to RP systems.
STL files define the boundaries of the CAD model using triangular facets.
This format transforms any model into a standardized definition, but it has
the disadvantage of generating a very large file when a realistic shape is
required. You usually have the option of setting the size of the facets when
you export your model. If the facets are small and the model complex, the
resulting STL file will be very large. If a larger size for the triangular facets
is used, however, the prototyped part will have noticeable facets on its
curved surfaces, as shown in Figure 10.85. Some exports can use smallerfacets around more detailed features and larger facets around less detailed
ones.
images
10.85 Triangular facets that define the boundaries of the model will be more visible on curved
surfaces and when the facet size used is large.
Once the CAD file has been exported, thin slices through the model are
generated to create the layers (Figure 10.86). Generally speaking, the
thinner the slice, the more accurate the part—however, thinner slices also
mean that it will take longer to generate the prototype part.
images images images images
10.86 Slices. (a) The model is imported as an STL file. (b and c) Slices through the model are
generated (.01 intervals shown here). (d) The software generates supports (shown here with lighter
lines) for segments of the part that do not rest on one of the lower slices.
The accuracy of the model’s surface is limited by the material used in the
process and how small the layers and features are that it can make. A
prototype part created by depositing individual layers of material in the X-Y
plane and dropping the table down in the Z-plane necessarily produces a
jagged edge. The size of the jaggies, as these are often called, is dependent
on the thickness of the layer of material that is deposited. This thickness is
limited by the size of the smallest particles that can be fused together. RP
systems that have more than three axes of movement can reduce oreliminate the jagged appearance by filling in material on angled edge
surfaces.
Rapid Prototyping Systems
Rapid prototyping systems vary in the types of materials used, in the size of
the model that can be created, and in the time it takes to generate a part. If
your company owns a rapid prototyping system, the choice of system may
be moot. If not, you should consider the design questions the prototype
needs to answer when selecting an appropriate system. The accuracy, size,
durability, and time it takes to create a prototype are dependent on the
process and material used.

10.87 Stereolithography. 3D Systems ProX™ 950 SLA Production Printer makes it possible to
directly manufacture precise plastic parts without CNC machining or injection molding. Part size
can range from smaller than the eye of a needle to a full-size automobile dashboard. (Courtesy of 3D
Systems, Inc.)
The main categories of rapid prototyping equipment are stereolithography,
selective laser sintering, fused deposition modeling, and 3D printing. Most
rapid prototyping systems can create parts up to about 10 cubic inches in
size. Laminate object manufacturing and topographic shell fabrication are
two less common methods that allow you to create prototypes of larger
parts. 3D printing also offers options for large parts, such as the car being
printed in Figure 10.88.images images
10.88 The Swim 3D Printed Car (top) as It Is Being Printed (bottom) (Courtesy of Local Motors.)
Stereolithography apparatus (SLA) uses laser-hardened resins to form the
model. Figure 10.87 shows an SLA system. The system software controls a
focused laser beam in a pool of light-sensitive polymer. The laser hardens
each layer in the shape of the cross section or slice of the part. As
successive layers are hardened they are submerged slightly into the resin
pool and the next layer is hardened on top of them. Holes and pockets in the
model are formed by uncured resin that easily pours out of the resulting
part. SLA systems create durable parts that can be painted and finished to
look very similar to the finished product. The range of accuracy for SLA
parts can be up to ± 0.05 mm. Because of this accuracy, the prototype parts
created using SLA can have relatively smooth surface finishes. SLA is an
established technology, since it was the first method on the market.
Solid ground curing (SGC) systems are similar to SLA systems except that
they use ultraviolet light to cure an entire cross section at once in the
polymer pool. A negative of the shape of the cross section is created on a
glass plate using electrostatic toner (similar to the process used in a copying
machine), then used to mask ultraviolet light in the shape of the cross
section. With no lasers to replace, these systems are cost-effective and
create accurate, durable parts.Direct Light Processing (DLP), Continuous Liquid Interface Production
(CLIP), Digital Light Synthesis™ (Carbon DLS™), and Daylight Polymer
Printing (DPP) are updated takes on the general SLA concept.

intelligence and takes advantage of advances in additive manufacturing (AM) to produce the entire
car without using tools. An SLS system using twelve lasers simultaneously is key to “printing” the
chassis. Most automotive companies print a few components and then assemble them with other
traditionally manufactured parts. (Photo of Cznger Vehicles’ 21C courtesy of @iamted7.)
DLP 3D uses a digital projector to cure a single layer at once. Some types
of parts can be printed faster than SLA systems where the cured image layer
is “drawn” using a laser, but the disadvantage can be the pixel shape in the
rasterized image (or “voxel” as it is called in 3D).

easy to produce printed prototypes of the vehicle in various scales. (Divergent 3D Factory photo courtesy of
Marc Weisberg.)
CLIP’s vat of resin is exposed to light through a window at the bottom of
the vat, which solidifies the cross-section being projected onto it. The
solidified shape is slowly raised and new liquid resin flows beneath it. Even
though the printing is done in very fine layers, the resin flooding is
continuous, allowing for much faster print times.
images10.91 Carbon Digital Light Synthesis™ is similar to Digital Light Processing (DLP). It uses a
cassette to hold resin with a window below that projects the digital light image to cure the layer. The
cassette provides a thin layer ready to polymerize and cure and allows fast print speeds. Advanced
materials allow mixing of light and thermally cured materials, where the UV resin holds the
thermally cured material in place for printing, and then is removed before curing. (Courtesy of Carbon,
Inc.)
Daylight Polymer Printing (DPP) cures special daylight sensitive polymers
using standard Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screens.

10.92 DLS allows for production of strong lightweight parts for direct manufacturing, such as this
bicycle seat. (Courtesy of Carbon, Inc.)
All of the SLA type methods may require post process washing, spinning,
or other methods to remove the excess resin and support structures needed
in the build. Developing environmentally friendly polymers and reducing
waste from uncured polymer and cleaning solvents is an ongoing area of
improvement.
Selective laser sintering (SLS) uses a focused laser to fuse powdered
metals, plastics, or ceramics. (Figure 10.93 shows an SLS-type rapid
prototyping system.) The fused layer is covered with additional powder, and
the next layer is fused to it. To form a hole in the prototyped piece, the
powdered material is simply not fused in that area. The unfused powder still
acts as a base for the next layer, but when the part is completed, the unfused
portions are simply poured out (see Figure 10.94). This process has the
advantage that models created from powdered metal can sometimes bemachined for further refinement. The parts can also be strong enough to be
used in certain types of assemblies as one-of-a-kind parts. When metals are
used as the material the process may be termed Direct Metal Printing
(DMP) or Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS). When a high-energy
electron beam is used instead of a laser, the process is termed Electron
Beam Melting (EBM).

10.94 This artist’s laser sintered design would be very difficult to manufacture using traditional
methods. (Courtesy of Vladimir Bulatov.)
An SLS system can create parts with accuracies of plus or minus 0.1 mm.
Other materials, such as a glass-filled nylon, may be used with the sintering
process to create parts with varying degrees of flexibility and durability.
Elastomeric materials with rubberlike characteristics, for example, make it
possible to prototype gaskets and athletic equipment.
Fused deposition modeling (FDM) systems use molten plastic deposited in
layers corresponding to cross sections on the part. Because the soft molten
plastic cannot be deposited in thin air, to make a hole or an overhang, a
second type of plastic is used to create a support structure. Because the twoplastics are different materials that do not readily adhere to one another, the
support structure can be separated from the actual part. (Figure 10.86d
shows these supports being formed by the RP software.) A part that is about
3 × 2 × 1 inch takes about three hours to create. MultiJet 3D Printers
(MJP) print thin layers of liquid plastic onto a platform. Each layer is cured
using UV light. A second wax material is used to build support structure.
The build platform lowers for the next layer and the process continues layer
by layer until the part is complete.
Laminated object manufacturing (LOM) produces solid parts from sheets
of material, such as paper or vinyl. LOM systems can be used to create
larger prototype parts. As in all rapid prototyping processes, software first
generates cross-sectional slices through the model. Instead of fusing the
slice, however, a computer-controlled laser cuts it from the first sheet of
material. Then, a heated roller bonds the next sheet to the previous layer,
and the next cross section is cut from this sheet. The material that will later
be removed is cut into crosshatched shapes to make removal easier.
Topographic shell fabrication (TSF) uses layers of high-quality silica sand
fused together with wax to build shells that can be used to mold rapid
prototypes of large-scale parts. The sand is deposited in layers and then
fused with molten wax sprayed from a computer-controlled three-axis
nozzle. More sand is deposited and then the next layer is fused. The layers
range from .05-inch to .15-inch thick and take about ten minutes per square
foot of model to print. Once all the slices have been deposited, the sand/waxshell is smoothed, then lined with plaster or other material. The shell is then
used as a temporary mold for creating parts of fiberglass, epoxy, foam,
concrete, or other materials. This method is able to handle very large shapes
up to 11 × 6 × 4 feet.

3D Printing/Material Jetting
Rapid prototyping systems referred to as 3D printing or material jetting
systems “print” layers of molten thermoplastic material. These low-cost
machines were designed to enable the use of prototypes early and often in
the design cycle. The relatively low cost 3D printing systems (currently
under $5,000) can be operated safely enough that they can sit next to the
regular office printer or copier. Another advantage of 3D printer systems is
that those having a three-axis print head can deposit the plastic on the edges
of the part in a way that creates a smooth model surface (see Figure 10.97).
Contemporary systems are being used with a wide variety of materials, such
as carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastics, that are strong enough for rapid
manufacturing using 3D printing methods (Figure 10.98).images

Rapid Tooling
Rapid prototyping systems were developed to produce parts without having
to create a mold or complete intermediate steps needed to manufacture a
part. Rapid tooling is a similar process, but one that creates the tool (usually
a mold for molded plastic or cast metal parts) through a rapid prototyping
process, not the part itself (Figure 10.99). Metal injection molds and molds
for cast metal parts are often one of the most expensive and time￾consuming parts of the design process. Rapid tooling processes can reduce
the amount of time involved in producing these tools. The resulting rapid
tool can be used to produce test products and to get products to market
early.
images
10.99 This mold was created by a rapid tooling process. (Courtesy of 3D Systems, Inc.)
Rapid tooling can be accomplished by several different methods. One is
direct mold design, in which the tool itself is created using a selective laser
sintering–type process. Another method uses rapid prototyping to produce amaster part from which a silicone rubber mold is formed. That mold is then
used to make other parts. A third method (a more traditional process ) uses
computer-controlled machining technology to create the cavity in a mold
blank to quickly create the mold.
Using a CAD file as input, the SLS process melts (or sinters) the powder to
form a green mold shape consisting of metal particles bound by smaller
areas of polymer. When the green mold is heated in a furnace, the plastic
polymer burns off, leaving only the metal mold. The mold is then machined
to a tolerance of ±.005 inch to eliminate any defects and can be drilled,
tapped, welded, and plated like a conventional mold.
With different materials, cores and molds for sand casting can be created
directly using an SLS system, then cured (hardened) in a conventional sand
casting oven. Another application is in investment casting, in which an
original shape called a master is used to create the proper-shaped opening in
a mold. The master is typically made of a wax material so that it will melt
out of the mold when molten metal is poured in. Investment casting masters
can be produced using SLS processes.
Silicon rubber molds are another means of producing rapid tooling. This
process uses an accurately prototyped part that is then coated with silicon
rubber to form a mold from which more parts can be molded. The MCP
Vacuum Casting System, which uses this process, is capable of producinglarge plastic parts that weigh as much as 12 pounds and span 2 feet by 3
feet.
Rapid NC machining of mold inserts from a 3D CAD file also promotes
rapid tooling. Even though this is more of a traditional process that creates
the mold cavity by removing material, the NC-machined cavity combined
with standard mold blanks can often lead to shorter tooling times for
injection-molded parts. Metal spraying is another method that can be used
in rapid tool production for less complex parts.
Despite the ease with which rapid tooling and rapid prototyping create
physical models from CAD data, a strong understanding of traditional and
current manufacturing methods will enable you to produce more cost￾effective and producible parts.
Spotlight
Cores and Cavities
Molded parts are formed by cavities and cores. The cavity is the part of the
mold that forms the outside shape of the object. The colloquial use of the
term mold generally refers to the cavity. Holes that will be formed in
molded parts are formed by cores. A core is a solid shape that fits inside the
mold. It will form a hole in the cooled cast metal or molten plastic. Cores
for cast metal parts are often made of packed sand. After the cast metal iscooled, the part is pounded to loosen the particles of sand from one another
so they can be poured out through a small hole. This is similar to the way
nonhardened resin or unfused powdered metal is poured out of holes in
rapid prototypes.
Industry Case
Testing the Model: Vibration Analysis
Lasers are subjected to some intense conditions. Installed in a wind tunnel,
the assembly needs to withstand supersonic wind velocities. In a helicopter,
the laser needs to function despite vibrations from the engine and rotors.
Each of these generates vibrations at different frequencies. Before Quantel
USA builds a prototype for testing, it uses the 3D model and SolidWorks
Simulation to “shake up” the laser assembly to see how the parts will
respond to vibrations at frequencies typical for the application.
The circuit board shown in Figure 10.100 generates a high-voltage pulse to
a laser optic. It is mounted to a cantilevered sheet metal part that attaches to
the laser assembly with two bolts. When the circuit board and mounting
assembly are subjected to vibrations at different frequencies, will the
resultant deflection (bending) result in failure? Laine McNeil, Senior
Mechanical Engineer, set up a simulation to help find out.images
10.100 The circuit board attaches to the sheet metal mount, which attaches via two bolts.
First, he prepared the model for testing by generating a mesh appropriate
for each part. Choosing the right kind of mesh and the right density
(number of nodes) is a judgment call driven by the goals of the test. For
example, the board components had been tested before, so McNeil could
focus on the board and the cantilevered sheet metal part. For the circuit
board, McNeil specified a 3D mesh to reflect the thickness of the board (see
Figure 10.101). For the sheet metal mount, he chose a shell mesh and
selected sheet metal as the material whose properties the mesh would use.
images
10.101 The Mesh Applied to the Model
It is common to simplify the 3D model (by removing fillets, perhaps) to
reduce the number of nodes in the mesh. Adding nodes improves accuracy,
but it also increases the time needed for analysis. For example, the shell
mesh chosen for the mount uses one surface of the part and applies the
stiffness properties uniformly over the entire part. This generated fewer
nodes, but provided enough complexity to adequately represent the sheet
metal part.
McNeil next set up the boundary conditions for the assembly: what are the
constraints on how the parts can move? First, how are the parts attached toeach other? Parts can be bonded or attached in a way that they cannot move
or slide (fixed geometry), hinged, connected via a roller/slider, or supported
by a spring. The circuit board was mounted in place with three rubber
interfacing pads. The rubber was bonded on one end to the sheet metal
mount and to the circuit board at the other for this analysis.
Second, how are the parts connected to the outside world? The sheet metal
mount is attached solely by its two bolts, so boundary conditions were set
for the two bolt holes (shown in green in Figure 10.102). That is, only the
bolt forces and friction are holding the mount; everything else can compress
and deflect in the simulation. McNeil could have chosen “on flat surface”
for the mount so that the part would not be allowed to deflect downward,
only up, but that was not needed for this test.
images
10.102 Choosing Boundary Conditions for the Circuit Board
The model was now analyzed at frequencies expected for its target use.
Typical vibration frequencies range from 100 to 2000 hertz. Some clients
have minimum standards that must be met, such as the U.S. military’s
“minimum integrity test.” For the circuit board analysis, no deflection was
detected in the sheet metal mount until almost 280 hertz. Figure 10.103c
shows the deflection. The material between the bolt holes is shaded a lighter
blue to indicate a small amount of movement, and the upper cantilevered
portion of the sheet metal mount is colored red, indicating significantlyhigher motion. The circuit board had already been tested to conform to the
minimum integrity test. Because the circuit board operated reliably despite
the first resonant frequency mode shape showing that deformation occurred
at as low as 120 hertz, McNeil could be confident that the assembly would
be satisfactory as designed.
images
10.103 Results of Testing at (a) 121.70, (b) 183.5, and (c) 274.69 Hertz
This result was not always the case. When the circuit board components
were initially tested, the cube (representing a power supply) at the top left
in Figure 10.103a fell off. It had been soldered onto the board, but the
solder pads were not strong enough to hold at typical vibrations. Glue was
added beneath the power supply to strengthen the bond.
In addition to simple resonant frequency shape generation, analysis can also
simulate the energy driving the vibration and the associated displacement.
Two examples of vibration-generating devices can readily demonstrate the
difference. A cell phone vibrates, but the energy driving the vibration is not
enough to shake a room. A hydraulically driven vibrator, used to dislodge
material from the bed of a dump truck, has enough energy to shake a
building one city block away. For the circuit board assembly, McNeil used
the built-in capabilities of SolidWorks, so the energy behind the vibration
was assumed to be infinite, and the displacement shown for the circuit
board parts was not meaningful. In this instance, this was not the focus ofthe analysis. If determining actual displacement values is required, the
model can be analyzed with a higher-end FEA package, in which a power
spectral density curve can be used to define the energy levels causing
motion.
At Quantel USA, testing the “virtual prototype” does not replace the need
for a physical model. For each design a physical model is built and shaken
at the frequencies expected during use. But if the model testing is done
properly, the physical model passes the test and only one prototype is
needed.

10.104 Even the mass of the paint is calculated into the mass properties for space vehicles. For the
SIRTF space telescope, the low-emissivity, silicon-grit-based coating was to be 24 mils thick. In the
calculations shown here, the surface area data from the model were used to calculate the mass of the
various “paints,” one of which turned out to be almost 9 kg. This additional mass resulted in the use
of a different coating to keep the mass of the telescope within the design constraints for the project.

Chapter Summary
Modern manufacturing involves product design, selection of materials,
and selection of processes. The process of transforming raw materials
into a finished product is called the manufacturing process.
The design process requires a clear understanding of the functions and
performance expected of that product.
Concurrent engineering integrates the design process with production to
optimize the life cycle of the product.
Computer-aided design, engineering, and manufacturing are used to
construct and study models (prototypes) allowing the designer to
conceptualize objects more easily and more cost-efficiently.
The selection of appropriate materials is key to successful product
development.
Manufacturing processing methods have changed dramatically over the
last few decades. More cost- and time-efficient processes can beimplemented using computer-integrated manufacturing.
Skills Summary
Now that you have completed this chapter you should be able to distinguish
between static and dynamic assembly models. Assembly constraints are
used in constraint-based modeling to create “intelligent” assemblies. You
should be familiar with several types of assembly constraints you may
encounter in your software package.
Often, it is desirable to show stock parts in assemblies. Sometimes these
parts can be acquired from a vendor. Thread, standard fasteners, and springs
are among the stock parts that you may not want to model, as they can
easily be indicated by a standard note.
Fit between mating parts in an assembly is an important design
consideration. You should be familiar with ways that a CAD database can
be used to check fit.
You should be able to list three manufacturing processes that are commonly
used to manufacture parts and some of the considerations that may arise
when modeling a part that will be manufactured using one of these
methods.
When you create an assembly model, you may add standard parts, sheet
metal parts, or use it to simulate the range of motion it is capable of. Nowthat you have completed this chapter, you should begin practicing using
your CAD models for engineering analysis. You should be able to extract
mass properties data from your CAD models and use them to solve simple
engineering problems. You should also be familiar with exporting CAD
data to various packages and selecting the best file format for the export. In
addition, you should be able to describe how various rapid protoyping
systems work to create physical models from CAD data.
Review Questions
1. Parent-child relationships are important for assemblies built using a
constraint-based modeler. What problems might occur, and how could
you prevent drawing management problems when deleting or changing
component parts in an assembly?
2. Define the differences between a static assembly and a dynamic
assembly. Which method would offer advantages to design teams who
access a common database of files through a network?
3. Many of the recent generation of computer modeling programs have
capabilities for solid modeling and constraint-based modeling. Research
the capabilities of the CAD program, solid modeler, or constraint-based
modeler at your school or workplace. What nomenclature, commands,
and procedures are used by the program to define capabilities in the
following:
1. External references
2. Global parameters3. Interference checking
4. Dynamic assemblies
4. A constraint-based modeler is used to create a gear cluster assembly by
inserting modeled bicycle gear cogs and spacers onto a splined hub.
Axial and radial alignment of the elements is critical to maintaining an
accurate model. Define a sensible base point to use when adding
individual cogs (gears) to the assembly.

5. Drawing templates, prototype drawings, and seed parts are one means to
help assemble parts effectively. What are three advantages of using these
file types when beginning a new model?
6. An entry-level engineer is given the job of creating a detailed assembly
drawing of a trailer-mounted pump and motor assembly. The engineer
models major components such as the diesel motor, the pump, and trailer
frame as well as all the small parts such as wheels, tires, nuts, bolts, and
lights. When the job is complete (after 10 solid weeks of work) and all
the drawing elements are correct, the work is presented to the supervisor.
What reaction would be expected from engineering management? Was
this an efficient use of resources? Do you have suggestions that would
streamline the process?7. Although 3D modeling can describe part and assembly configuration in
accurate detail, many parts or features are rarely included in a model
until very late in the process if included at all. List four parts or features
that fall into this category, and give reasons for omitting detail.
8. Component models of detail parts or assemblies can be obtained from
suppliers and manufacturers. These models save the designer time and
reduce the potential for error but can be difficult to use in a constraint￾based model. Why? What advantage does the supplier gain from this
service?
images images
9. Constraint-based assemblies often have global parameters defined to
assist in developing mating features of different parts. Identify which
features of the two (mating) parts described in the following drawings
would be candidates for shared parameters. (Note the different plotted
scale of the parts!)
10. A designer must anticipate and understand the manufacturing processes
that will be used to fabricate the created components. Describe
differences in the model for a part designed for polyethylene (plastic)
injection molding versus one for machined aluminum. Can you
anticipate unique model requirements for a part created using hand lay￾up resin-transfer molded composite (a process similar to that used for
fiberglass)?11. Material changes are common in the development phase of engineered
parts. Consider a component part modeled first using 6061-T6
Aluminum, and then with 1020 Steel. No dimensional changes are made.
Do each of the following properties of a solid change with changing
material? How?
1. Volume
2. Mass

4. Centroid
5. Moment of inertia
6. Radius of gyration
12. Vector data and raster data are both used in graphics programs. Which
type of data format is better suited for CAD systems that have mass
properties capability?
13. Define the steps involved in creating a stereolithographic rapid prototype
part from a solid model. What are some of the considerations when
deciding whether a CAD model is a good candidate for prototyping
using stereolithography?
14. Give a brief explanation of the physical process used to create rapid
prototype parts by each of the following methods. What are the
advantages and disadvantages of each method?
1. Stereolithography
2. Fused deposition modeling
3. Selective laser sintering4. 3D printing
15. How does rapid tooling differ from rapid prototyping? In what situations
might either method be used to create actual working components rather
than just shape-representative models?

accurately on an engineering drawing.

ANSI/ASME Y14.5 Dimensioning and Tolerancing
ASME Y14.41 Digital Product Definition Data Practices

module hood was created from a 3D model using SolidWorks. (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)
Overview
It is essential to describe not only the shape of the features you design but
also their sizes and locations. Dimensions and notes define the size, finish,
and other requirements to fully define what you want manufactured.
Standards organizations prescribe how dimensions should appear and the
general rules for their selection and placement in the drawing and in digital
models, but it takes skill and practice to dimension drawings so that their
interpretation is clear and unambiguous.Whether you are creating 2D drawings or 3D models, CAD systems are
great for producing dimensions that follow standards for the appearance of
the dimensions themselves. However, the job of selecting which dimension
to show or where to place it in a drawing takes a level of intelligence that is
not part of most CAD systems. Those important decisions are still up to the
CAD user—or in other words, you.
Learning good practices for dimensioning and tolerancing to define part
geometry can also help you create better 3D models. If you have a good
understanding of how the sizes and locations of model features will be
defined, you can plan how to capture this information clearly in the model.
Understanding Dimensioning
You can describe an object’s shape using different types of drawing views.
By providing dimensions, you describe the sizes and locations of design
features.
The need for interchangeability of parts is the basis for modern part
dimensioning. Drawings for products must be dimensioned so that
production personnel all over the world can make mating parts that will fit
properly when assembled or when used to replace parts.
The increasing need for precision manufacturing and interchangeability has
shifted responsibility for size control to the design engineer or detail drafter.
The production worker must properly interpret the instructions given on thedrawings to produce the required part or construct the building or system.
You should be familiar with materials and methods of construction and with
production requirements to create drawings that define exactly what you
want to have manufactured.
Practices for dimensioning architectural and structural drawings are similar
in many ways to those for dimensioning manufactured parts, but some
practices differ. The portfolio section throughout this book shows a variety
of drawings that you can use to familiarize yourself with practices from
other disciplines.
Figure 11.1 shows a dimensioned CAD drawing created from a solid model.
Although CAD can be a great help for proper dimensioning technique, you
must provide the intelligence to choose and place the dimensions to create a
drawing that conveys the design clearly. Even if you are going to transmit
3D CAD files as the product definition, you still need to consider how
accurately the parts that you will eventually receive must match the model
definition. Directly specifying tolerances in the model is one way to do this.
You will learn more about tolerancing in Chapter 12.11.1 Automatically Generated Dimensions. Views and dimensions can be generated automatically
from a solid model. (Courtesy of Robert Kincaid.)
Three Aspects of Good Dimensioning
Dimensions are given in the form of distances, angles, and notes regardless
of the dimensioning units being used. For both CAD and hand drawing, the
ability to create good dimensioned drawings requires the following:
1. Technique of dimensioning
The standards for the appearance of lines, spacing of dimensions, size of
arrowheads, and so on, allow others to read your drawing. A typicaldimensioned drawing is shown in Figure 11.2. Note the strong contrast
between the visible lines of the object and the thin lines used for the
dimensions. The dimensions are easily read because they follow the
standards for dimensioning technique.
11.2 A Drawing Dimensioned in Millimeters
2. Placement of dimensions
Use logical placement for dimensions according to standard practices so
that they are legible, easy to find, and easy for the reader to interpret.
Notice that when dimensions are placed between two views, it is easier
to see how the dimension relates to the feature as shown in each view.
3. Choice of dimensions
The dimensions you show affect how your design is manufactured.
Dimension first for function and then review the dimensioning to see ifyou can make improvements for ease of manufacturing without
adversely affecting the final result. 3D CAD models can be transmitted
as all or part of a digital product definition, but this method still requires
a thorough understanding of the sizes and relationships between the part
features.
A drawing released for production should show the object in its completed
state and contain all necessary information for specifying the final part. As
you select which dimensions to show, provide functional dimensions that
can be interpreted to manufacture the part as you want it built. Keep in
mind:
The finished piece.
The function of the part in the total assembly.
How you will inspect the final part to determine its acceptability.
Production processes.
Also, remember the following points:
Give dimensions that are necessary and convenient for producing the
part.
Give sufficient dimensions so that none must be assumed.
Avoid dimensioning to points or surfaces inaccessible to the worker.
Do not provide unnecessary or duplicate dimensions.
ToleranceWhen a finished part is measured, it will vary slightly from the exact
dimension specified. Tolerance is the total amount that the feature on the
actual part is allowed to vary from what is specified by the drawing or
model dimension. You will learn a number of ways to specify tolerances in
Chapter 12.
A good understanding of tolerance is important to understanding
dimensioning, especially when choosing which dimensions to show. For
now, keep in mind that tolerance can be specified generally by giving a note
on the drawing such as
ALL TOLERANCES ±.02 INCH UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.
Another method of specifying tolerance is illustrated in the title block
shown in Figure 11.3.
11.3 A Title Block Specifying Tolerances (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)Geometric Breakdown
Engineering structures are composed largely of simple geometric shapes,
such as the prism, cylinder, pyramid, cone, and sphere, although this is
changing with the more organic shapes manufactured through various direct
printing processes. These shapes may be exterior (positive) or interior
(negative) forms. For example, a steel shaft is a positive cylinder, and a
round hole is a negative cylinder.
The basic shapes result directly from design necessity—keeping forms as
simple as possible—and from manufacturing operations. Forms having
plane surfaces are produced by planing, shaping, milling, and so forth;
forms having cylindrical, conical, or spherical surfaces are produced by
turning, drilling, reaming, boring, countersinking, and other rotary
operations. One way to consider dimensioning of engineering structures
involves two basic steps:
1. Give the dimensions showing the sizes of the simple geometric shapes,
called size dimensions.
2. Give the dimensions locating these elements with respect to one another,
called location dimensions. Note that a location dimension locates a 3D
geometric element and not just a surface; otherwise, all dimensions
would have to be classified as location dimensions.
This process of geometric analysis helps you determine the features of the
object and the features’ relationships to one another, but it is not enoughjust to dimension geometry. You must also consider the function of the part
in the assembly and the manufacturing requirements. This process is similar
to that used when modeling designs in 3D CAD.
11.1 Lines Used in Dimensioning
A dimension line is a thin, dark, solid line terminated by an arrowhead,
indicating the direction and extent of a dimension (Figure 11.4). In a
machine drawing, the dimension line is usually broken near the middle to
place the dimension value in the line. In structural and architectural
drawing, the dimension figure is placed above an unbroken dimension line.
11.4 Dimension Line
As shown in Figure 11.5, the dimension line nearest the object outline
should be spaced at least 10 mm (3/8′′) away. All other parallel dimension
lines should be at least 6 mm (1/4′′) apart, and more if space is available.
The spacing of dimension lines should be uniform throughout the drawing.11.5 Extension Lines
An extension line is a thin, dark, solid line that extends from a point on the
drawing to which a dimension refers (Figure 11.5). The dimension line
meets the extension lines at right angles, except in special cases. A gap of
about 1.5 mm (1/16′′) should be left where the extension line would join
the object outline. The extension line should extend about 3 mm (1/8′′)
beyond the outermost arrowhead.
A centerline is a thin, dark line alternating long and short dashes.
Centerlines are commonly used as extension lines in locating holes and
other symmetrical features (Figure 11.6). When extended for dimensioning,
centerlines cross over other lines of the drawing without gaps. Always end
centerlines using a long dash. Refer to Figures 11.4–11.6 for examples of
lines used in dimensioning.11.6 Centerlines
Step by Step
Dimensioning by Geometric Breakdown
To dimension the object shown in isometric at right, use the geometric
breakdown as follows:
 Consider the geometric features of the part.
In this case the features to be dimensioned include
two positive prisms,
one positive cylinder,
one negative cone, and
six negative cylinders. Specify the size dimensions for each feature by adding the dimension
values as indicated. (In this illustration, the word “size” indicates the
various dimension values.) Note that the four cylinders of the same size can
be specified with one dimension. Finally, locate the geometric features with respect to one another.
(Actual values would replace the words “size” and “location” in this
illustration.) Always check to see that the object is fully dimensioned.11.2 Using Dimension and Extension Lines
Dimension lines and extension lines should follow the guidelines shown in
Figure 11.7a. The shorter dimensions are nearest to the object outline.
Dimension lines should not cross extension lines, as in Figure 11.7b, which
results from placing the shorter dimensions outside. Note that it is perfectly
satisfactory to cross extension lines (Figure 11.7a), but they should not be
shortened (Figure 11.7c). A dimension line should never coincide with or
extend from any line of the drawing (Figure 11.7d). Avoid crossing
dimension lines wherever possible.11.7 Dimension and Extension Lines
Dimensions should be lined up and grouped together as much as possible,
as in Figure 11.8a, and not as in Figure 11.8b.
11.8 Grouped Dimensions
In many cases, extension lines and centerlines must cross visible lines of the
object (Figure 11.9a). When this occurs, gaps should not be left in the lines
(Figure 11.9b).11.9 Crossing Lines
Dimension lines are normally drawn at right angles to extension lines, but
an exception may be made in the interest of clarity, as in Figure 11.10.
11.10 Oblique Extension
11.3 Arrowheads
Arrowheads, shown in Figure 11.11, indicate the extent of dimensions.
They should be uniform in size and style throughout the drawing, not varied
according to the size of the drawing or the length of dimensions. Sketch
arrowheads freehand so that the length and width have a ratio of 3:1. The
length of the arrowhead should be equal to the height of the dimensionvalues (about 3 mm or 1/8′′ long). For best appearance, fill in the
arrowhead, as in Figure 11.11d. Figure 11.12 shows the preferred
arrowhead styles for mechanical drawings. Most CAD systems allow you to
select from a variety of styles.
11.11 Arrowheads
11.12 Order of Preference for Arrowhead Styles
Tip
When you are drawing by hand and using the arrowhead method in which
both strokes are directed toward the point, it is easier to make the strokes
toward yourself.
11.4 Leaders
A leader is a thin, solid line directing attention to a note or dimension and
starting with an arrowhead or dot.A leader should be an inclined straight line drawn at a large angle, except
for the short horizontal shoulder (about 3–6 mm or 1/8 − 1/4′′) extending
from the center of the first or last line of lettering for the note. A leader to a
circle should be a radial line, which is a line that would pass through the
center of the circle if extended. Figures 11.13a–d show examples of leader
lines; radial lines are shown in Section 11.22.
11.13 Leaders
Use an arrowhead to start the leader when you can point to a particular line
in the drawing, such as the edge of a hole. Use a dot to start the leader when
locating something within the outline of the object, such as an entire surface
(see Figures 11.13e and f).
For the Best Appearance, Make Leaders
Near each other and parallel.
Across as few lines as possible.
Don’t Make Leaders
Parallel to nearby lines of the drawing.Through a corner of the view.
Across each other.

11.5 Drawing Scale and Dimensioning
Drawing scale is indicated in the title block, as described in Chapter 2. The
scale is intended to help you visualize the object by giving an approximate
idea of its size, but is not intended to communicate dimensions. Never scale
measurements from drawings to find an unknown dimension. Many
standard title blocks include a note such as DO NOT SCALE DRAWING
FOR DIMENSIONS, as shown in Figure 11.14.
11.14 Drawing scale is noted in the title block. The drawing should not be scaled for dimensions.
(Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)
Draw a heavy straight line under any single dimension value that is not to
scale (Figure 11.15). Before CAD was widely used, if a change made in adrawing was not important enough to justify correcting the drawing, the
practice was simply to change the dimension value. If a dimension does not
match the appearance in the drawing, the part is made as dimensioned, not
as pictured. If there seems to be an error, many manufacturers check to
confirm that the drawing is correct; however, it is your responsibility to
specify exactly what you want built. If the entire drawing is not prepared to
a standard scale, note NONE in the scale area of the title block. You may
see the abbreviation NTS on older drawings, meaning “not to scale.”
11.15 Draw a heavy line under any dimension value that is not to scale.
When you create a drawing using CAD, make sure to define dimensions
according to the proper standards. Because it is easy to edit CAD drawings,
you should generally fix the drawing geometry when making changes andnot merely change dimension values. If you are using a digital model as the
sole definition for the part, the model dimensions must be represented
accurately.
Keeping Dimensions and Lettering Legible at Smaller Scales
The sizes for lettering height, dimension line spacing, and so on, are to be
shown that size on the plotted sheet. If you are going to use reduced-size
working prints, increase the lettering, dimension arrows, and other sizes by
approximately 50% (depending on the amount of reduction) to maintain
legibility on the smaller print.
11.6 Direction of Dimension Values and Notes
All dimension values and notes are lettered horizontally to be read from the
bottom of the sheet, as oriented by the title block. Figure 11.16 shows the
direction for reading dimension values.11.16 Unidirectional Dimension Figures
The exception is when dimensioning from a baseline as in coordinate
dimensioning. Then dimension figures may be aligned with the dimension
lines so that they may be read from the bottom or right side of the sheet as
shown in Figure 11.17. In both systems, general notes on the sheet and
dimensions and notes shown with leaders are always aligned horizontally to
read from the bottom of the drawing.11.17 Rectangular coordinate dimensioning may show values reading from the right. (Reprinted from
ASME Y14.5M-1994 (R2004), by permission of The American Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.)
11.7 Dimension Units
Dimension values are shown using metric or decimal-inch values.
Millimeters and decimal inches can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and
divided more easily than fractions. For inch–millimeter equivalents of
decimal and common fractions, see the inside back cover of this book.
When a note stating ALL MEASUREMENTS IN MILLIMETERS or ALL
MEASUREMENTS IN INCHES UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED is
used in the title block to indicate the measurement units, no units are
needed with the dimension values. UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED is
often abbreviated as UOS on drawings. When indicating dimensions:
Millimeters are indicated by the lowercase letters mm placed to the right
of the numeral, as in 12.5 mm.Meters are indicated by the lowercase m, as in 50.6 m.
Inches are indicated by the symbol ″ placed slightly above and to the
right of the numeral.
Feet are indicated by the symbol ′ similarly placed. It is customary in
feet-inch expressions to omit the inch mark.
It is standard practice to omit millimeter designations and inch marks on
drawings and note the units in the title block except when there is a
possibility of misunderstanding. For example, 1 VALVE should be 1′′
VALVE.
Either meters or feet and inches and fractional inches are used in
architectural and structural work where precision in the thousandths of an
inch is not necessary and the steel tape or framing square is used to make
measurements. Commodities such as pipe and lumber are identified by
standard nominal sizes that are close to the actual dimensions.
In some industries, all dimensions, regardless of size, are given in inches; in
others, dimensions up to and including 72′′ are given in inches, and
dimensions greater than 72′′ are given in feet and inches. In U.S. structural
and architectural drafting, all dimensions of 1′ or more are usually
expressed in feet and inches.
11.8 Millimeter ValuesThe millimeter is the commonly used unit for most metric engineering
drawings. One-place millimeter decimals are used when tolerance limits
permit. Two (or more)-place millimeter decimals are used when higher
tolerances are required. One drawing can combine dimensions shown with
more and fewer decimal places depending on the necessary tolerance. Keep
in mind that 0.1 mm is approximately equal to .004 in. If you are used to
working in U.S. customary units, don’t provide an unrealistic precision
when specifying millimeter values.
Figure 11.18 shows various ways that millimeter values can be shown for
dimensioning. Figure 11.19 shows an example drawing dimensioned in
millimeters.
11.18 Millimeter Dimension Values11.19 Complete Millimeter Dimensioning
11.9 Decimal-Inch Values
Two-place inch decimals are typical when tolerance limits permit. Three or
more decimal places are used for tolerance limits in the thousandths of an
inch. In two-place decimals, the second place preferably should be an even
digit (for example, .02, .04, and .06 are preferred to .01, .03, or .05) so that
when the dimension is divided by 2 (for example, when determining the
radius from a diameter), the result will still be a two-place decimal.
However, odd two-place decimals are used when required for design
purposes, such as in dimensioning points on a smooth curve or when
strength or clearance is a factor. A typical example of the use of the
complete decimal-inch system is shown in Figure 11.20.11.20 Complete Decimal Dimensioning
11.10 Rules for Dimension Values
Good hand-lettering is important for dimension values on sketches. The
shop produces according to the directions on the drawing, so to save time
and prevent costly mistakes, make all lettering perfectly legible.
Make all decimal points bold, allowing ample space. When the metric
dimension is a whole number, do not show either a decimal point or a zero.
When the metric dimension is less than 1 mm, a zero precedes the decimal
point.
When the decimal-inch dimension is used on drawings, a zero is not used
before the decimal point of values less than 1 in. Typical values are shown
to two decimal places even when they represent a whole number (e.g., use2.00 instead of 2). Correct decimal-inch dimension values are shown in
Figures 11.21a–e.
11.21 Decimal-Inch Dimension Values
11.11 Rules for Rounding Decimal Dimension Values
It is difficult to maintain tolerances smaller than a few thousandths of an
inch in manufacturing. To provide reasonable tolerances that can be
achieved in manufacturing, calculated dimension values for drawings
sometimes need to be rounded. Unlike rounding rules used for statistical
values, it is preferred to round drawing values to an even number.
When rounding a decimal value to fewer places, regardless of whether the
dimension is expressed in inches or metric units, follow these rules:
If the number following the rounding position is less than 5, make no
change.
If the number following the rounding position is more than 5, round up.
If the number following the rounding position is a 5, round to an even
number. (To do this, note whether the number in the rounding position is
even or odd. If the 5 follows an odd number in the rounding position,round up to an even number. If the 5 follows an even number in the
rounding position, make no change.)
Examples of Rounded Decimal Values
3.4632 becomes 3.463 when rounded to three places. (Make no change,
because the 2 following the rounding position is less than 5.)
3.4637 becomes 3.464 when rounded to three places. (Round up,
because the 7 following the rounding position is more than 5.)
8.37652 becomes 8.376 when rounded to three places. (Make no change,
because the 6 in the rounding position is even and the number following
the rounding position is a 5.)
4.375 becomes 4.38 when rounded to two places. (Round up to an even
number, because the 7 in the rounding position is odd and the number
following the rounding position is a 5.)
11.12 Dual Dimensioning
Dual dimensioning is used to show metric and decimal-inch dimensions on
the same drawing. Two methods of displaying the dual dimensions are
described next.
Position Method
In the position method of dual dimensioning, the millimeter dimension is
placed above the inch dimension, and the two are separated by a dimensionline, or by an added line when the unidirectional system of dimensioning is
used. An alternative arrangement is the millimeter dimension to the left of
the inch dimension, with the two separated by a slash line, or virgule.
Placement of the inch dimension above or to the left of the millimeter
dimension is also acceptable. Each drawing should illustrate the dimension
identification as MILLIMETER
INCH
 or MILLIMETER/INCH.
Bracket Method
In the bracket method of dual dimensioning, the millimeter dimension is
enclosed in parentheses. The location of this dimension is optional but
should be uniform on any drawing—that is, above or below or to the left or
the right of the inch dimension. Each drawing should include a note to
identify the dimension values, such as DIMENSIONS IN () ARE
MILLIMETERS.
11.13 Combination Units
When more than one measurement system is used on the same drawing, the
main units are indicated through a note in or near the title block. The
alternative units are indicated with an abbreviation after the dimension
value. Use mm after the dimension value if millimeters, or IN if inches,
only when combining two measurement systems on one drawing. In the
U.S. to facilitate the changeover to metric dimensions, some drawings aredual-dimensioned in millimeters and decimal inches, as shown in Figure
11.22. The second set of units shown in parentheses are for reference only.
11.22 Dual-Dimensioned Drawing in Millimeters. On drawing, inch values are given for reference
only.
11.14 Dimensioning Symbols
A variety of dimensioning symbols are used to replace traditional terms or
abbreviations (see Figure 11.23). The symbols are preferred because (1)
they take less space in the drawing and (2) they are internationally
recognized and therefore do not have translation issues if the part is
manufactured in a country where a different language is spoken. Traditional
terms and abbreviations in the ANSI/ASME Y14.38 standard can be used if
necessary.11.23 Form and Proportion of Dimensioning Symbols (Reprinted from ASME Y14.5M-1994 (R2004), by
permission of The American Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.)
11.15 Placing and Showing Dimensions Legibly
Rules for the placement of dimensions help you dimension your drawings
so that they are clear and readable. They also help locate dimensions in
standard places so that someone manufacturing the part doesn’t have to
search a complicated drawing to find a dimension. You cannot always
follow every placement rule to the letter, so keep in mind that the ultimate
goal is to dimension the drawing clearly so that the parts are built to your
specifications.
Rules for Placing Dimensions ProperlyNever letter a dimension value over any line on the drawing; if
necessary, break the line.
In a group of parallel dimension lines, the dimension values should be
staggered, as in Figure 11.24a, and not stacked up one above the other, as
in Figure 11.24b.
11.24 Staggered Numerals, Metric
Do not crowd dimension figures into limited spaces, making them
illegible. There are techniques for showing dimension values outside
extension lines or in combination with leaders (Figure 11.25). If
necessary, add a removed partial view or detail to an enlarged scale to
provide the space needed for clear dimensioning.
11.25 Fitting Dimension Values in Limited Spaces (Metric Dimensions)Place dimensions between views when possible, but attached to only a
single view. This way it is clear that the dimension relates to the feature,
which can be seen in more than one view.
When a dimension must be placed in a hatched area or on the view, leave
an opening in the hatching or a break in the lines for the dimension
values, as shown in Figure 11.26b.
11.26 Dimensions and Section Lines
Dimensions should not be placed on a view unless it promotes the clarity
of the drawing, as shown in Figure 11.27. In complicated drawings such
as Figure 11.27c, it is often necessary to place dimensions on a view.
11.27 Place dimensions on view only when clarity is enhanced.Avoid dimensioning to hidden lines (see Figure 11.28).
11.28 Placement of Dimensions
Do not attach dimensions to visible lines where the meaning is not clear,
such as the dimension 20 in the top view shown in Figure 11.29b.
11.29 Place dimensions where the contours of the object are defined.Notes for holes are usually placed where you see the circular shape of
the hole, as in Figure 11.29a, but give the diameter of an external
cylindrical shape where it appears rectangular. This way it is near the
dimension for the length of the cylinder.
Give dimensions where the shapes are shown—where the contours of the
object are defined—as is shown in Figure 11.29.
Locate holes in the view that shows the shape of the hole clearly.
Tip
Thinking of Dimensioning in Terms of Material RemovalThere are many ways to dimension a drawing. If you are having trouble
getting started, it may help to consider the overall block of material and
what features are to be removed from it, similar to the way you visualize
for a sketch. This is especially true when the part is to be manufactured
using a process that removes material, such as milling.Look for the largest portions to be removed and give dimensions for their
sizes and locations first. Next, add dimensions for the smaller features.
Because the overall dimensions will be the largest, they will be placed
farthest from the view. If you are using CAD, it is easy to move
dimensions later if you need more space. When you are sketching, block
the overall dimension in lightly and leave substantial space between it and
the drawing view for placement of shorter dimensions.
Use the rules that you have learned to place dimensions on the view that
best shows the shape and close to where the feature is shown. This makes
the drawing easier to read.
11.16 Superfluous Dimensions
All necessary dimensions must be shown, but do not give unnecessary or
superfluous dimensions. Figure 11.30 shows examples of how to omit
unnecessary dimensions. Do not repeat dimensions on the same view or on
different views, or give the same information in two different ways.11.30 Superfluous Dimensions
As Figure 11.30b shows, it can be impossible to determine how the designer
intended to apply the tolerance when a dimension is given two different
ways. In chained dimensions, one dimension of the chain should be left outif the overall dimension is given, so that the machinist will work from one
surface only. This is particularly important where an accumulation of
tolerances can cause problems with how parts fit or function.
Do not omit dimensions, thinking, for example, that a hole is symmetrical
and will be understood to be centered. Note in Figure 11.30b that one of the
two location dimensions should be given for the hole at the right side of the
part, even though it is centered. As the creator of the drawing, you should
specify exactly how the part is to be built and inspected.
As shown in Figure 11.30e, when one dimension clearly applies to several
identical features, or a uniform thickness, it need not be repeated, but the
number of places should be indicated. Dimensions for fillets and rounds and
other noncritical features need not be repeated, nor need the number of
places be specified.
11.17 Dimensioning Angles
Angles are dimensioned by specifying the angle in degrees and a linear
dimension, as shown in Figure 11.31a. Coordinate dimensions can also be
given for two legs of a right triangle, as shown in Figure 11.31b. The
coordinate method is better when a high degree of accuracy is required.
Variations in degrees of angle are hard to control because the amount of
variation increases with the distance from the vertex of the angle. Methodsof indicating angles are shown in Figure 11.31. The tolerancing of angles is
discussed in Chapter 12.
11.31 Dimensioning Angles
In civil engineering drawings, slope represents the angle with the
horizontal, whereas batter is the angle with the vertical. Both are expressed
by making one member of the ratio equal to 1, as shown in Figure 11.32.
Grade, as of a highway, is similar to slope but is expressed in percentage of
rise per 100 feet of run. Thus a 20′ rise in a 100′ run is a grade of 20%. In
structural drawings, angular measurements are made by giving the ratio of
run to rise, with the larger size being 12′′. These right triangles are referred
to as bevels.
11.32 Angles in Civil Engineering Projects
11.18 Dimensioning ArcsA circular arc is dimensioned in the view where its true shape in seen by
giving the value for its radius preceded by the abbreviation R (Figure
11.33). The center is marked with a small cross to clarify the drawing, but
not for small or unimportant radii or undimensioned arcs. When there is
room enough, both the radius value and the arrowhead are placed inside the
arc. If not, the arrowhead is left inside but the value is moved outside, or
both the arrowhead and value are moved outside. When section lines or
other lines are in the way, the value and leader can be placed outside the
sectioned or crowded area. For a long radius, when the center falls outside
the available space, the dimension line is drawn toward the actual center,
but a false center may be indicated and the dimension line “jogged” to it
(Figure 11.33f).
11.33 Dimensioning Arcs
11.19 Fillets and Rounds
Individual fillets and rounds are dimensioned like other arcs. If there are
only a few and they are obviously the same size, giving one typical radius is
preferred. However, fillets and rounds are often numerous on a drawing,
and they usually are some standard size, such as metric R3 and R6, orR.125 and R.250 when using decimal-inch dimensions. In this case, give a
general note in the lower portion of the drawing, such as:
FILLETS R6 AND ROUNDS R3 UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED
or
ALL CASTING RADII R6 UNLESS NOTED
or
ALL FILLETS AND ROUNDS R6.
11.20 Size Dimensioning: Prisms
The right rectangular prism is probably the most common geometric shape.
Front and top views are dimensioned as shown in Figures 11.34a and b. The
height and width are usually given in the front view, and the depth in the
top view. The vertical dimensions can be placed on the left or right, usually
in-line. Place the horizontal dimension between views as shown and not
above the top or below the front view. Front and side views should be
dimensioned as in Figures 11.34c and d. An example of size dimensions for
a machine part made entirely of rectangular prisms is shown in Figure
11.35.11.34 Dimensioning Rectangular Prisms
11.35 Dimensioning a Machine Part Composed of Prismatic Shapes
11.21 Size Dimensioning: Cylinders
The right circular cylinder is the next most common geometric shape and is
commonly seen as a shaft or a hole. Cylinders are usually dimensioned bygiving the diameter and length where the cylinder appears as a rectangle. If
the cylinder is drawn vertically, give the length at the right or left, as in
Figures 11.36a and b. If the cylinder is drawn horizontally, give the length
above or below the rectangular view, as in Figures 11.36c and d.
11.36 Dimensioning Cylinders
Do not use a diagonal diameter inside the circular view, except when clarity
is improved. Using several diagonal diameters on the same center becomes
very confusing.
The radius of a cylinder should never be given, because measuring tools,
such as the micrometer caliper, are designed to check diameters. Holes are
usually dimensioned by means of notes specifying the diameter and the
depth, as shown in Figure 11.37, with or without manufacturing operations.11.37 Use of ∅ in Dimensioning Cylinders
Give the diameter symbol ∅ before all diameter dimensions, as in Figure
11.38a (ANSI/ASME Y14.5). In some cases, the symbol ∅ may be used to
eliminate the circular view, as shown in Figure 11.38b. The abbreviation
DIA following the numerical value was used on older decimal inch
drawings.
11.38 Dimensioning a Machine Part Composed of Cylindrical ShapesWhen it is not clear that a hole goes all the way through the part, add the
note THRU after the value.
11.22 Size Dimensioning: Holes
Figure 11.39 shows standard symbols used in dimensioning holes. The
order of items in a note corresponds to the order of procedure in the shop in
producing the hole. The leader of a note should point to the circular view of
the hole, if possible.
11.39 Dimensioning Holes
When the circular view of the hole has two or more concentric circles, as
for counterbored, countersunk, spotfaced or tapped holes, the arrowhead
should touch the outer circle. Draw a radial leader line, that is, one that
would pass through the center of the circle if it were extended. Figure 11.40
shows good and bad examples of radial leader lines.11.40 Good and Bad Examples of Radial Leader Lines
Countersunk, counterbored, spotfaced, and tapped holes are usually
specified by standard symbols or abbreviations, as shown in Figure 11.41.
11.41 Standard Symbols for Hole Dimensions
Two or more holes can be dimensioned by a single note and by specifying
the number of holes, as shown at the top of Figure 11.41. It is widely
acceptable to use decimal fractions for both metric or inch drill sizes, asshown in Figure 11.41b. For numbered or letter-size drills (listed in
Appendix 13), specify the decimal size or give the number or letter
designation followed by the decimal size in parentheses—for example #28
(.1405) or “P” (.3230). Metric drills are all in decimal sizes and are not
designated by number or letter.
Specify only the dimensions of the holes, without a note listing whether the
holes are to be drilled, reamed, or punched, as shown in Figures 11.41c and
d. The manufacturing technician or engineer is usually better suited to
determine the least expensive process to use that will achieve the tolerance
required.
11.23 Applying Standard Dimensioning Symbols
Use standard dimensioning symbols when possible to save space and
communicate dimensions clearly. (Refer to Figure 11.23 for details on how
to draw the symbols.) Most CAD software contains a palette of standard
symbols. Figure 11.42 shows the application of a variety of standard
symbols. Note that Figure 11.42a shows the basic dimension symbol used
in geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GDT). In this case, “basic”
does not mean “ordinary.” You will learn more about the use of this special
symbol in Chapter 12.11.42 Use of Dimensioning Symbols. (Reprinted from ASME Y14.5M-1994 (R2004), by permission of The American
Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.)
11.24 Dimensioning Counterbores and Spotfaces with Fillets
At times a fillet radius is specified for a counterbored or spotfaced hole.
Figure 11.43 shows an example of counterbored hole with a fillet radius
specified. Note that the fillet radius is to the inside of the counterbore
diameter.11.43 Counterbore with Fillet. A note specifying a counterbore fillet radius defines a radius to the
inside of the counterbore diameter.
When a fillet radius is specified for a spotface dimension, the fillet radius is
added to the outside of the spotface diameter, as shown in Figure 11.44.11.44 Spotface with Fillet. A note specifying a spotface fillet radius defines a radius added to the
outside of the spotface diameter.
11.25 Dimensioning Triangular Prisms, Pyramids, and Cones
To dimension a triangular prism, give the height, width, and displacement
of the top edge in the front view, and the depth in the top view, as is shown
in Figure 11.45a.11.45 Dimensioning Various Shapes
For a rectangular pyramid, give the heights in the front view and the
dimensions of the base and the centering of the vertex in the top view, as in
Figure 11.45b. If the base is square, you need give dimensions for only one
side of the base, preceded by the square symbol, as in Figure 11.45c (or on
older drawings you may see it labeled SQ).
For cones, give the altitude and the diameter of the base in the triangular
view (Figure 11.45d). For a frustum of a cone, give the vertical angle and
the diameter of one of the bases (Figure 11.45e). Another method is to give
the length and the diameters of both ends in the front view. Still another is
to give the diameter at one end and the amount of taper per foot in a note.
Figure 11.45f shows a two-view drawing of a plastic knob. Overall, it is
spherical and is dimensioned by giving its diameter preceded by the
abbreviation and symbol for spherical diameter, S∅ (in older notations it
may be followed by the abbreviation SPHER). The torus-shaped bead
around the knob is dimensioned by giving the thickness of the ring and the
outside diameter.Figure 11.45g shows a spherical end dimensioned by a radius preceded by
the abbreviation SR. Internal shapes corresponding to the external shapes in
Figure 11.45 would be dimensioned similarly.
11.26 Dimensioning Curves
One way to dimension curves is to give a group of radii, as shown in Figure
11.46a. Note that in dimensioning the R126 arc, whose center is
inaccessible, the center may be moved inward along a centerline and a jog
made in the dimension line. Another method is to dimension the outline
envelope of a curved shape so that the various radii are self-locating from
“floating centers,” as shown in Figure 11.46b. Both circular and noncircular
curves may be dimensioned by using coordinate dimensions, or datums, as
in Figure 11.46c.
11.46 Dimensioning Curves
11.27 Dimensioning Curved Surfaces
When angular measurements are unsatisfactory, you may give chordal
dimensions, as shown in Figure 11.47a, or linear dimensions on the curvedsurfaces, as shown in Figure 11.47b.
11.47 Dimensioning Along Curved Surfaces
11.28 Dimensioning Rounded-End Shapes
The method for dimensioning rounded-end shapes depends on the degree of
accuracy required. If precision is not necessary, use methods convenient for
manufacturing, as in Figures 11.48a–c. Figures 11.48d–g show methods
used when accuracy is required.
The link to be cast (or cut from sheet metal or plate) in Figure 11.48a is
dimensioned as it would be laid out for manufacture, giving the center-to￾center distance and the radii of the ends. Note that only one radius
dimension is necessary, and the number of places is included with the size
dimension.11.48 Dimensioning Rounded-End Shapes. For accuracy, in parts d–g, overall lengths of rounded￾end shapes are given, and radii are indicated, but without specific values. The center-to-center
distance may be required for accurate location of some holes. In part g, the hole location is more
critical than the location of the radius, so the two are located.
In Figure 11.47b, the pad on a casting with a milled slot is dimensioned
from center to center to help the pattern maker and machinist in layout. Thisalso gives the total travel of the milling cutter. The width dimension
indicates the diameter of the milling cutter, so give the diameter of a
machined slot. A cored slot, however, would be dimensioned by radius to
conform with the pattern-making procedure.
The semicircular pad in Figure 11.48c is laid out like the pad in Figure
11.48b, except that angular dimensions are used. Angular tolerances can be
used if necessary.
11.29 Dimensioning Threads
Local notes are used to specify dimensions of threads. For tapped holes, the
notes should, if possible, be attached to the circular views of the holes, as
shown in Figure 11.49. For external threads, the notes are usually placed in
the longitudinal views, where the threads are more easily recognized, as in
Figure 11.49b and c. For a detailed discussion of thread notes, see Chapter
13.11.49 Dimensioning Threads
11.30 Dimensioning Tapers
A taper is a conical surface on a shaft or in a hole. The usual method of
dimensioning a taper is to give the amount of taper in a note, such as
TAPER 0.167 ON DIA (with TO GAGE often added), and then give the
diameter at one end with the length or give the diameter at both ends and
omit the length. Taper on diameter means the difference in diameter per unit
of length.
Standard machine tapers are used on machine spindles, shanks of tools, or
pins, and are described in “Machine Tapers” in ANSI/ASME B5.10. Such
standard tapers are dimensioned on a drawing by giving the diameter
(usually at the large end), the length, and a note, such as NO. 4
AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD TAPER as shown in Figure
11.50a.11.50 Dimensioning Tapers
For not-too-critical requirements, a taper may be dimensioned by giving the
diameter at the large end, the length, and the included angle, all with proper
tolerances, as shown in Figure 11.50b. Alternatively, the diameters of both
ends, plus the length, may be given with necessary tolerances.
For close-fitting tapers, the amount of taper per unit on diameter is
indicated as shown in Figures 11.50c and d. A gage line is selected and
located by a comparatively generous tolerance, and other dimensions are
given appropriate tolerances as required.
11.31 Dimensioning Chamfers
A chamfer is a beveled or sloping edge. It is dimensioned by giving the
length of the offset and the angle, as in Figure 11.51a. A 45° chamfer also
may be dimensioned in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 11.51a, but
usually it is dimensioned by note, as in Figure 11.51b.11.51 Dimensioning Chamfers
11.32 Shaft Centers
Shaft centers are required on shafts, spindles, and other conical or
cylindrical parts for turning, grinding, and other operations. Such a center
may be dimensioned, as shown in Figure 11.52. Normally the centers are
produced by a combined drill and countersink.
11.52 Shaft Center
11.33 Dimensioning Keyways
The methods of dimensioning keyways for Woodruff keys and stock keys
are shown in Figure 11.53. Note, in both cases, the use of a dimension to
center the keyway in the shaft or collar. The preferred method ofdimensioning the depth of a keyway is to give the dimension from the
bottom of the keyway to the opposite side of the shaft or hole, as shown.
The method of computing such a dimension is shown in Figure 11.53d.
Values for A may be found in machinists’ handbooks.
11.53 Dimensioning Keyways
For general information about keys and keyways see Appendix 18.
11.34 Dimensioning Knurls
A knurl is a roughened surface to provide a better handgrip or to be used for
a press fit between two parts. For handgrip purposes, it is necessary only to
give the pitch of the knurl, the type of knurling, and the length of the
knurled area, as shown in Figures 11.54a and b. To dimension a knurl for a
press fit, the toleranced diameter before knurling should be given, as shown
in Figure 11.54c. A note should be added that gives the pitch and type of
knurl and the minimum diameter after knurling (see ANSI/ASME B94.6).11.54 Dimensioning Knurls
11.35 Finish Marks
A finish mark is used to indicate that a surface is to be machined, or
finished, as on a rough casting or forging. To the patternmaker or diemaker,
a finish mark means that allowance of extra metal in the rough workpiece
must be provided for the machining.
On drawings of parts to be machined from rolled stock, finish marks are
generally unnecessary, because it is obvious that the surfaces are finished.
Similarly, it is not always necessary to show finish marks when the
dimension implies a finished surface, such as ∅6.22–6.35 (metric) or
∅2.45–2.50 (decimal-inch).
Figure 11.55 shows three styles of finish marks. The new basic symbol
preferred by ANSI is shown in (a). The old general symbol ∨, shown in (d),
and the old symbol , shown in (e), are used to indicate an unspecified
smooth machined surface. Due to more advanced inspection capabilities
and the desire to build in quality processes, the old unspecified symbols are
not used as much, unless used with a note, such as UOS ALL SURFACES0.8/Ra 0.4. The old general symbol is like a capital V, made about 3 mm
high, in conformity with the height of dimensioning lettering. The new
basic symbol, preferred by ANSI, is like a larger capital with the right leg
extended. The short leg is made about 5 mm high, and the height of the long
leg is about 10 mm. The basic symbol may be altered for more elaborate
surface texture specifications.
11.55 Finish Marks
Figure 11.55b shows a simple casting having several finished surfaces. In
Figure 11.55c, two views of the same casting show how the finish marks
are indicated on a drawing. The finish mark is shown only on the edge view
of a finished surface and is repeated in any other view in which the surface
appears as a line, even if the line is a hidden line.
If a part is to be finished all over, finish marks should be omitted, and a
general note, such as FINISH ALL OVER or FAO, should be lettered on
the lower portion of the sheet.
The several kinds of finishes are detailed in machine shop practice manuals.
The following terms are among the most commonly used: finish all over,rough finish, file finish, sand blast, pickle, scrape, lap, hone, grind, polish,
burnish, buff, chip, spotface, countersink, counterbore, core, drill, ream,
bore, tap, broach, and knurl. When it is necessary to control the surface
texture of finished surfaces beyond that of an ordinary machine finish, the
symbol is used as a base for the more elaborate surface quality symbols.
Older drawings may contain the previous style of surface finish symbol
shown in Figure 11.55e.
Finished surfaces can be measured more accurately, so provide dimensions
from these when possible, as in Figure 11.56.
11.56 Correct and Incorrect Marks Showing Dimensions to Finished Surfaces. The point of the
symbol should be directed inward toward the body of metal similar to a tool bit, not upside down, as
is shown in part b.11.36 Surface Roughness
The demands of automobiles, airplanes, and other machines that can stand
heavy loads and high speeds with less friction and wear have increased the
need for accurate control of surface quality by the designer, regardless of
the size of the feature. Simple finish marks are not adequate to specify
surface finish on such parts.
Surface finish is intimately related to the functioning of a surface, and
proper specification of finish for surfaces such as bearings and seals is
necessary. Surface quality specifications should be used only where needed,
since the cost of producing a finished surface becomes greater as the quality
of the surface called for is increased. Generally, the ideal surface finish is
the roughest that will do the job satisfactorily.
The system of surface texture symbols recommended by ANSI/ASME
(Y14.36) for use on drawings, regardless of the system of measurement
used, is now broadly accepted by U.S industry. These symbols are used to
define surface texture, roughness, and lay. See Figure 11.57 for the meaning
and construction details for these symbols. The basic surface texture symbol
in Figure 11.57 a indicates a finished or machined surface by any method,
just as does the old general ∨ symbol. Modifications to the basic surface
texture symbol, shown in Figures 11.57b–c, define restrictions on material
removal for the finished surface. Where surface texture values other thanaverage roughness are specified, the symbol must be drawn with the
horizontal extension, as shown in Figure 11.57d.

Applications of Surface Roughness Symbols
Applications of the surface texture symbols are given in Figure 11.58. Note
that the symbols read from the bottom and/or the right side of the drawing
and that they are not drawn at any angle or upside down. Measurements forroughness and waviness, unless otherwise specified, apply in the direction
that gives the maximum reading, usually across the lay, as shown in Figure
11.59.

Recommended Roughness and Waviness Values
Recommended roughness height values are given in Table 11.1. When it is
necessary to indicate the roughness-width cutoff values, the standard values
used are listed in Table 11.2. If no value is specified, the 0.80 value is
assumed.

Lay Symbols and Surface Texture Symbols

surface texture symbols as shown in the given examples.11.60 Lay Symbols (Reprinted from ASME Y14.36-2018, by permission of The American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

A typical range of surface roughness values that may be obtained from
various production methods is included in Table 12.2.
11.37 Location Dimensions
After you have specified the sizes of the geometric shapes composing the
structure, give location dimensions to show the relative positions of these
geometric shapes. Figure 11.61a shows rectangular shapes located by their
faces. In Figure 10.61b, cylindrical or conical holes or bosses, or other
symmetrical shapes, are located by their centerlines. Location dimensions
for holes are preferably given where the holes appear circular, as shown in
Figures 11.62 and 11.63.11.61 Location Dimensions
11.62 Locating Holes11.63 Locating Holes about a Center
In general, location dimensions should be built from a finished surface or
from an important center or centerline. Location dimensions should lead to
finished surfaces wherever possible, because rough castings and forgings
vary in size, and unfinished surfaces cannot be relied on for accurate
measurements. The starting dimension, used in locating the first machined
surface on a rough casting or forging, must necessarily lead from a rough
surface or from a center or a centerline of the rough piece.
Holes equally spaced about a common center may be dimensioned by
giving the diameter of the circle of centers, or bolt circle. Use a note such as
3X to indicate repetitive features or dimensions, where the X means times,
and the 3 indicates the number of repeated features. Put a space between the
letter X and the dimension as shown in Figure 11.63. Unequally spaced
holes are located by means of the bolt circle diameter plus angular
measurements with reference to only one of the centerlines. Examples are
shown in Figure 11.63.Where greater accuracy is required, coordinate dimensions should be
given, as shown in Figure 11.63c. In this case, the diameter of the bolt circle
is enclosed in parentheses to indicate that it is to be used only as a reference
dimension. Reference dimensions are given for information only. They are
not intended to be measured and do not govern the manufacturing
operations. They represent calculated dimensions and are often useful in
showing the intended design sizes.
When several cylindrical surfaces have the same centerline (as in Figure
11.64b) you do not need location dimensions to show they are concentric;
the centerline is enough.
11.64 Locating HolesWhen several nonprecision holes are located on a common arc, they are
dimensioned by giving the radius and the angular measurements from a
baseline, as shown in Figure 11.64a. In this case, the baseline is the
horizontal centerline.
In Figure 11.64b, the three holes are on a common centerline. One
dimension locates one small hole from the center; the other gives the
distances between the small holes. Note that the dimension at X is left off.
This method is used when the distance between the small holes is the
important consideration. If the relation between the center hole and each of
the small holes is more important, then include the distance at X and make
the overall dimension a reference dimension.
Figure 11.64c shows another example of coordinate dimensioning. The
three small holes are on a bolt circle whose diameter is given for reference
purposes only. From the main center, the small holes are located in two
mutually perpendicular directions.
Another example of locating holes by means of linear measurements is
shown in Figure 11.64d. In this case, one measurement is made at an angle
to the coordinate dimensions because of the direct functional relationship of
the two holes.
In Figure 11.64e, the holes are located from two baselines, or datums. When
all holes are located from a common datum, the sequence of measuring andmachining operations is controlled, overall tolerance accumulations are
avoided, and proper functioning of the finished part is assured. The datum
surfaces selected must be more accurate than any measurement made from
them, must be accessible during manufacture, and must be arranged to
facilitate tool and fixture design. It may be necessary to specify accuracy of
the datum surfaces in terms of straightness, roundness, flatness, and so on.
Figure 11.64f shows a method of giving, in a single line, all the dimensions
from a common datum. Each dimension except the first has a single
arrowhead and is accumulative in value. The overall dimension is separate.
These methods of locating holes are applicable to locating pins or other
symmetrical features.
11.38 Mating Dimensions
In dimensioning a single part, its relation to mating parts must be taken into
consideration. In Figure 11.65a, for example, a guide block must fit into a
slot in a base. Those dimensions common to both parts, such as the distance
between the holes, are mating dimensions. Other dimensions that do not
control the accurate fitting together of two parts are not mating dimensions.
images
11.65 Mating DimensionsThese mating dimensions should be given on the multiview drawings in the
corresponding locations, as shown in Figures 11.65b and c. The actual
values of two corresponding mating dimensions may not be exactly the
same. For example, the width of the slot in Figure 11.65b may be
dimensioned 1/32′′ (0.8 mm) or several thousandths of an inch larger than
the width of the block in Figure 11.65c, but these are mating dimensions
figured from a single basic width. Mating dimensions need to be specified
in the corresponding locations on the two parts and toleranced to ensure
proper fitting of the parts.
In Figure 11.66a, the dimension A is a necessary mating dimension and
should appear on both the drawings of the bracket and of the frame. In
Figure 11.66b, which shows a redesign of the bracket into two parts,
dimension A is not used on either part because it is not necessary to closely
control the distance between the cap screws. But dimensions F are now
essential mating dimensions and should appear on the drawings of both
parts. The remaining dimensions, E, D, B, and C, are not considered to be
mating dimensions, since they do not directly affect the mating of the parts.11.66 Bracket Assembly
11.39 Coordinate Dimensioning
Coordinate dimensioning practices allow you to identify a corner of the part
as the 0,0 location and dimension the remaining features relative to that
position. This is very useful when numerically-controlled machines will be
used in manufacturing the part, as the dimensions relate well to the
manufacturing process. The lower-left corner on the part is often used as the
0,0 location (see Figure 11.67) as this is frequently the default for the
numerically-controlled machine.11.67 Hole Table. A hole table is often used to dimension complicated patterns of holes. (Reprinted
from ASME Y14.5M-1994 (R2004), by permission of The American Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.)
Rectangular coordinate dimensioning without dimension lines is shown in
Figure 11.68.
11.68 Rectangular Coordinate Dimensioning without Dimension LinesHole tables are often used in conjunction with coordinate dimensioning to
save space when there are numerous holes of different sizes.
11.40 Tabular Dimensions
A series of objects having like features but varying in dimensions may be
represented by one drawing, as shown in Figure 11.69. Letters are
substituted for dimension figures on the drawing, and the varying
dimensions are given in tabular form. The dimensions of many standard
parts are given in this manner in catalogs and handbooks.
11.69 Tabular Dimensioning
11.41 Dimensioning for Numerically-Controlled Machining
When dimensioning for numerically-controlled machining, follow these
basic guidelines.
A set of three mutually perpendicular datum or reference planes is usually
required. These planes either must be obvious, as shown in Figure 11.70, ormust be clearly identified. (See Chapter 12 for information on identifying
datums.)
11.70 Dimensioning for Numerically-Controlled Machining
The designer selects as origins for dimensions those surfaces or features
most important to the function of the part. Enough of these features are
selected to position the part in relation to the set of mutually perpendicular
planes. All related dimensions are then made from these planes.
All dimensions should be in decimals.
Angles should be given, where possible, in degrees and decimal parts of
degrees.
Tools such as drills, reamers, and taps should be left up to the
manufacturer unless a certain process is specifically required.All tolerances should be determined by the design requirements of the
part, not by the capability of the manufacturing machine.
11.42 Machine, Pattern, and Forging Dimensions
The pattern maker is interested in the dimensions required to make the
pattern, and the machinist is concerned only with the dimensions needed to
machine the part. Frequently, a dimension that is convenient for the
machinist is not convenient for the pattern maker, or vice versa. Because the
pattern maker uses the drawing only once, while making the pattern, and
the machinist refers to it continuously, the dimensions should be given
primarily for the convenience of the machinist.
If the part is large and complicated, two separate drawings are sometimes
made—one showing the pattern dimensions and the other the machine
dimensions. The usual practice, however, is to prepare one drawing for both
the pattern maker and the machinist.
For forgings, it is common practice to make separate forging drawings and
machining drawings. A forging drawing of a connecting rod, showing only
the dimensions needed in the forge shop, is shown in Figure 11.71. A
machining drawing of the same part would contain only the dimensions
needed in the machine shop.11.71 Forging Drawing of Connecting Rod (Courtesy of General Motors LLC.)
11.43 Sheet Metal Bends
In sheet metal dimensioning, allowance must be made for bends. The
intersection of the plane surfaces adjacent to a bend is called the mold line,
and this line, rather than the center of the arc, is used to determine
dimensions, as shown in Figure 11.72. The following procedure for
calculating bends is typical. If the two inner plane surfaces of an angle are
extended, their line of intersection is called the inside mold line or IML, as
shown in Figures 11.73a–c. Similarly, if the two outer plane surfaces areextended, they produce the outside mold line or OML. The centerline of
bend ( imagesB) refers primarily to the machine on which the bend is
made and is at the center of the bend radius.
11.72 Profile Dimensioning
The length, or stretchout, of the pattern equals the sum of the flat sides of
the angle plus the distance around the bend measured along the neutral axis.
The distance around the bend is called the bend allowance or BA. When
metal bends, it compresses on the inside and stretches on the outside. At a
certain zone in between, the metal is neither compressed nor stretched, and
this is called the neutral axis, as shown in Figure 11.73d. The neutral axis is
usually assumed to be 0.44 of the thickness from the inside surface of the
metal.11.73 Bends
The developed length of material, or bend allowance, to make the bend is
computed from the empirical formula
BA = (0.017453R + 0.0078T)N
where R = radius of bend, T = metal thickness, and 
N = number of degrees of bend, as in Figure 11.73c.
11.44 Notes
It is usually necessary to supplement the direct dimensions with notes.
Notes should be brief and carefully worded to allow only one interpretation.
Notes should always be lettered horizontally on the sheet and arranged
systematically. They should not be crowded and should not be placed
between views, if possible. Notes are classified as general notes when they
apply to an entire drawing and as local notes when they apply to specific
items.
General NotesGeneral notes should be lettered in the lower right-hand corner of the first
sheet of a set of drawings, above or to the left of the title block or in a
central position below the view to which they apply. If notes are continued
onto a second sheet, that sheet number should be given in a note on the first
sheet of the drawing set, as in NOTES CONTINUED ON PAGE 4.
Here are some examples of general notes:
FINISH ALL OVER (FAO)
BREAK SHARP EDGES TO R0.8
G33106 ALLOY STEEL-BRINELL 340–380
ALL DRAFT ANGLES 3° UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED
DIMENSIONS APPLY AFTER PLATING
In machine drawings, the title strip or title block will carry many general
notes, including those for materials, general tolerances, heat treatments, and
patterns.
Local Notes
Local notes apply to specific operations only and are connected by a leader
to the point at which such operations are performed, as shown in Figure11.74. The leader should be attached at the front of the first word of a note,
or just after the last word, and not at any intermediate place.
11.74 Local Notes
Use common abbreviations in notes (such as THD, DIA, MAX) only when
they cannot be misunderstood. Avoid less common abbreviations. “When in
doubt, spell it out” is a rule of thumb to avoid problems with misunderstood
notes.
If a common symbol is available, it is preferred to the abbreviation because
symbols are internationally recognized and not language dependent. All
abbreviations should conform to ANSI Y14.38.In general, leaders and notes should not be placed on the drawing until the
dimensioning is substantially completed. Notes and lettering should not
touch lines of the drawing or title block. If notes are lettered first, they may
be in the way of necessary dimensions and will have to be moved.
When using CAD to add text for drawing notes, keep in mind the final scale
to which the drawing will be plotted. You may need to enlarge the text for it
to be legible when plotted to a smaller scale.
Local notes and dimensions can also be placed in 3D CAD models. When
doing so, take care to point the note to the surface in a place where it is
unambiguous. Use an arrow at the end of the leader line to point to a
feature. Use a dot at the end of the leader line when pointing a note onto the
surface shape.
Flag Notes
Flag notes are another option for specific or local notes. These notes are
identified with a flag note symbol, typically a rectangle, hexagon, or
triangle containing the number of the note and placed with the general
notes.
imagesFlag notes apply only at each specific area of the drawing identified with
the note symbol. See Fig. 11.74o for an example of a flag note.
Number the general notes and flag notes consecutively in a single list. Do
not re-use note numbers of notes added in one revision and then
subsequently deleted. If your PDM system assigns values, the notes it
generates do not have to be in a continuous sequence.
11.45 Standards
Dimensions should be given, wherever possible, to make use of readily
available materials, tools, parts, and gages. The dimensions for many
commonly used machine elements—such as bolts, screws, nails, keys,
tapers, wire, pipes, sheet metal, chains, belts, ropes, pins, and rolled metal
shapes—have been standardized, and the drafter must obtain these sizes
from company standards manuals, from published handbooks, from ANSI
standards, or from manufacturers’ catalogs. Tables of some of the more
common items are given in the appendices.
Such standard parts are not delineated on detail drawings unless they are to
be altered for use; they are conventionally drawn on assembly drawings and
are listed in parts lists. Common fractions are often used to indicate the
nominal sizes of standard parts or tools. If the complete decimal-inch
system is used, all such sizes are ordinarily expressed by decimals—for
example, .250 DRILL instead of 1/4 DRILL. If the all-metric system ofdimensioning is used, then the preferred metric drill of the approximate
same size (.2480′′) will be indicated as 6.30 DRILL.
11.46 Dos and Don’ts of Dimensioning
The following checklist summarizes briefly most of the situations in which
a beginning designer is likely to make a mistake in dimensioning. Students
should check the drawing with this list before submitting it to the instructor.
1. Each dimension should be given clearly so that it can be interpreted in
only one way.
2. Dimensions should not be duplicated, nor should the same information
be given in two different ways—except for dual dimensioning—and no
dimensions should be given except those needed to produce or inspect
the part.
3. Dimensions should be given between points or surfaces that have a
functional relation to each other or that control the location of mating
parts.
4. Dimensions should be given to finished surfaces or important
centerlines, in preference to rough surfaces, wherever possible.
5. Dimensions should be given so that it will not be necessary for the
machinist to calculate, scale, or assume any dimension.
6. Dimension features should be attached to the view where the feature’s
shape is best shown.7. Dimensions should be placed in the views where the features
dimensioned are shown true shape.
8. Dimensioning to hidden lines should be avoided wherever possible.
9. Dimensions should not be placed on a view unless clarity is promoted
and long extension lines are avoided.
10. Dimensions applying to two adjacent views should be placed between
views, unless clarity is promoted by placing some of them outside.
11. The longer dimensions should be placed outside all intermediate
dimensions so that dimension lines will not cross extension lines.
12. In machine drawing, all unit marks should be omitted, except when
necessary for clarity; for example, 1′′ VALVE or 1 mm DRILL.
13. Don’t expect production personnel to assume that a feature is centered
(as a hole on a plate), but give a location dimension from one side.
However, if a hole is to be centered on a symmetrical rough casting,
mark the centerline and omit the locating dimension from the centerline.
14. A dimension should be attached to only one view, not to extension lines
connecting two views.
15. Detail dimensions should line up in chain fashion.
16. A complete chain of detail dimensions should be avoided; it is better to
omit one. Otherwise add a reference to the overall dimension by
enclosing it within parentheses.
17. A dimension line should never be drawn through a dimension figure. A
figure should never be lettered over any line of the drawing. The line can
be broken if necessary.18. Dimension lines should be spaced uniformly throughout the drawing.
They should be at least 10 mm (.38′′) from the object outline and 6 mm 
(.25′′) apart.
19. No line of the drawing should be used as a dimension line or coincide
with a dimension line.
20. A dimension line should never be joined end to end with any line of the
drawing.
21. Dimension lines should not cross, if avoidable.
22. Dimension lines and extension lines should not cross, if avoidable.
(Extension lines may cross each other.)
23. When extension lines cross extension lines or visible lines, no break in
either line should be made.
24. A centerline may be extended and used as an extension line, in which
case it is still drawn like a centerline.
25. Centerlines should not extend from view to view.
26. Leaders for notes should be straight, not curved, and point to the center
of circular views of holes wherever possible.
27. Leaders should slope at 45°, 30°, or 60° with horizontal, but may be
made at any convenient angle except vertical or horizontal.
28. Leaders should extend from the beginning or the end of a note, with the
horizontal “shoulder” extending from midheight of the lettering.
29. Dimension figures should be approximately centered between the
arrowheads, except in a stack of dimensions, where they should be
staggered.30. Dimension figures should be about 3 mm (.13′′) high for whole
numbers and 6 mm (.25′′) high for fractions.
31. Dimension figures should never be crowded or in any way made difficult
to read.
32. Dimension figures should not be lettered over lines or sectioned areas
unless necessary, in which case a clear space should be reserved for the
dimension figures.
33. Dimension figures for angles should generally be lettered horizontally.
34. Fraction bars should never be inclined except in confined areas, such as
in tables.
35. The numerator and denominator of a fraction should never touch the
fraction bar.
36. Notes should always be lettered horizontally on the sheet.
37. Notes should be brief and clear, and the wording should be standard in
form.
38. Finish marks should be placed on the edge views of all finished surfaces,
including hidden edges and the contour and circular views of cylindrical
surfaces.
39. Finish marks should be omitted on holes or other features where a note
specifies a machining operation.
40. Finish marks should be omitted on parts made from rolled stock.
41. If a part is finished all over, all finish marks should be omitted and the
general note FINISH ALL OVER or FAO should be used.42. A cylinder is dimensioned by giving both its diameter and length in the
rectangular view, except when notes are used for holes. A diagonal
diameter in the circular view may be used in cases where it increases
clarity.
43. Manufacturing processes are generally determined by the tolerances
specified, rather than specifically noted in the drawing. When the
manufacturing process must be noted for some reason—such as for
dimension holes to be bored, drilled, and reamed—use leaders that
preferably point toward the center of the circular views of the holes.
Give the manufacturing processes in the order they would be performed.
44. Drill sizes should be expressed in decimals, giving the diameter. For
drills designated by number or letter, the decimal size must also be
given.
45. In general, a circle is dimensioned by its diameter, an arc by its radius.
46. Diagonal diameters should be avoided, except for very large holes and
for circles of centers. They may be used on positive cylinders for clarity.
47. A diameter dimension value should always be preceded by the symbol
∅.
48. A radius dimension should always be preceded by the letter R. The
radial dimension line should have only one arrowhead, and it should pass
through or point through the arc center and touch the arc.
49. Cylinders should be located by their centerlines.
50. Cylinders should be located in the circular views, if possible.51. Cylinders should be located by coordinate dimensions in preference to
angular dimensions where accuracy is important.
52. When there are several rough, noncritical features obviously the same
size (fillets, rounds, ribs, etc.), it is necessary to give only typical
(abbreviation TYP) dimensions or to use a note.
53. When a dimension is not to scale, it should be underscored with a heavy
straight line or marked NTS or NOT TO SCALE.
54. Mating dimensions should be given correspondingly on both drawings of
mating parts.
55. Pattern dimensions should be given in two-place decimals or in common
whole numbers and fractions to the nearest 1/16′′.
56. Decimal dimensions should be used for all machining dimensions.
57. Cumulative tolerances should be avoided where they affect the fit of
mating parts.

The Cad Database as Design Documentation
images
EDrawings software allows you to view 3D and 2D drawings. Many companies transmit and store
eDrawings as their design record. (Courtesy of Zolo Technologies, Inc.)
An important advantage of producing an accurate CAD database is that you
can use the model as a basis for manufacturing. Today’s CAD packagesoffer tools for incorporating tolerances and manufacturing notes into the 3D
CAD database itself that improve its ability to document the design. A good
understanding of the type of information available in your CAD database
combined with the knowledge of how to show critical dimensions and
tolerances clearly are important in achieving the most benefit from 3D CAD
software.
To use the CAD database as design documentation, companies must
consider the legal requirements for maintaining a permanent record of the
design. For some industries, a permanent record (or snapshot) of the design
used for production must be maintained. A changeable record on the
computer may not be considered a legally acceptable practice, or it may be
acceptable only if a standard of model/drawing control is met.
ASME Y14.41, Digital Product Definition Data Practices, describes the
standard for using a digital product definition to document designs. Some
companies use the 3D model with electronic annotations stored in the file or
a related database as the final documentation for the product. Other
companies produce 2D original drawings from the 3D model to
communicate the design for manufacturing and to provide design
documentation for the project. For those companies the 3D model may be
stored, but the design record is the fully dimensioned 2D drawings.
Other companies use a combination of the computer files and 2D drawings
to document the design. The 2D drawings are used to communicateinformation about critical tolerances and other information that may not be
easily visible in the 3D file. The CAD file serves as the interface to
automated manufacturing processes, but the drawing allows the company to
call attention to those elements of the design that are critical to its function.
Because the manufacturer may not have the same software that was used to
create the CAD model, the documentation needs to use a format that can be
interpreted by the manufacturer, mold maker, or others who will create or
inspect the parts. This is frequently a combination of electronic files in a
common 3D format (such as IGES) for the model, and 2D CAD
documentation drawings (either printed or in a common 2D file format such
as DXF) showing critical dimensions.
Whether the 2D drawings are printed on paper or stored electronically,
correctly shown orthographic views still provide much of the basis for
communicating and documenting the design. Correctly shown drawing
views are also used to communicate information for user manuals and
repair manuals, as well as for manufacture and inspection.

Chapter Summary
To increase clarity, dimensions and notes are added to a drawing to
describe size, location, and manufacturing process precisely.
Drawings are scaled to fit on a standard sheet of paper. Drawings created
by hand are drawn to scale. CAD drawings are drawn full size and scaled
when they are printed.
Dimensions and notes are placed on drawings according to prescribed
standards.
Good placement practices are essential to making drawings easy to read.
It is important to learn to dimension basic shapes. Complex drawings are
usually made of many simpler features.Finish symbols and notes are a part of describing how the part is to be
manufactured. They should be shown on the drawing as needed.
The CAD database can serve as the design documentation, in which case
drawings may not be necessary.
Dimensioning dos and don’ts can provide guidelines for dimensioning
practices, but overall, the dimensions that are necessary for the part to be
manufactured and function in the assembly as intended must be shown.
Special dimensioning techniques are used for surfaces that have been
machined by one of the manufacturing processes.

Specifying Tolerance Is Essential to Ensuring that Interchangeable Parts Fit Together in Assemblies. A
worker uses an inside caliper to measure the hole diameter to ensure that it is within the specified tolerance
range. (dotshock/Shutterstock.)
Overview
Interchangeable manufacturing requires effective size control by the designer
because, in mass production, all parts must fit together properly, regardless of
where they are made.
For example, an automobile manufacturer might subcontract parts manufacturing
to other companies—both parts for new automobiles and replacement parts forrepairs. All parts must be enough alike that each can fit properly in any
assembly.
The maximum acceptable amount that an actual part feature can vary from a
specified dimension is called tolerance. On technical drawings, tolerances
specify the degree of accuracy required for the provided dimensions.
Parts can be made to very precise dimensions, even to a few millionths of an
inch or thousandths of a millimeter—as in gage blocks—but highly accurate
parts are extremely expensive to produce and there is still some variation
between the exact dimension and the actual size of the part. Fortunately,
perfectly exact sizes are not needed. The accuracy needed in a part depends on
its function.
One aspect of quality is determined by manufacturing tolerances. Products with
small variations in shape may fit together more precisely and command higher
prices. However, it would not be practical for all products to be manufactured to
high precision. For example, a manufacturer of children’s tricycles might go out
of business if the parts were made with jet engine accuracy—no one would be
willing to pay the price.
Waste results when the manufacturing process cannot maintain shape and size
within prescribed limits. By monitoring the manufacturing processes and
reducing waste, a company can improve profits. This direct relationship to profit
is one of the main reasons that tolerancing is critical to manufacturing success.
Understanding ToleranceTolerancing is an extension of dimensioning. It allows you to specify a range of
accuracy for the shape, size, and position of every feature of a product, so that
the manufactured parts will fit together and function properly when assembled.
CAD software often provide features for dimensioning, tolerancing, and
checking fits and interferences that aid in the tolerancing process. To effectively
provide tolerances in your drawings and CAD models, you must:
Understand the fit required between mating parts.
Have a clear picture of how inspection measurements are performed.
Be able to apply tolerance symbols to a drawing or model.
Apply functional tolerancing to individual part features.
Tolerance
Tolerance is the total amount a specific dimension is permitted to vary.
Tolerances are specified so that any two mating parts will fit together. To keep
part cost low, specify a tolerance as large as possible that still permits
satisfactory function of the part. Tolerance can be stated several different ways
on a drawing.
One method of providing a tolerance is to specify the dimension and give a plus
or minus range after it. Figure 12.1 shows an example of a bilateral tolerance. A
dimension given as 1.625 ± 0.002 means that the manufactured part may be
1.627 or 1.623 or anywhere between these maximum and minimum limit
dimensions, as shown in Figure 12.2. The tolerance (the total amount the actual
part feature is allowed to vary from what is specified) is 0.004.images
12.1 Direct Limits Used to Specify a Bilateral Tolerance
images
12.2 Upper and Lower Limits of Dimension
Quality Control
When you purchase parts or have them manufactured by another company, you
must have a way to ensure that the parts are manufactured precisely enough.
Before paying for parts, most companies have a process to quality certify (QC)
the parts against the drawing or model. Larger batches of parts may use
statistical methods in which a relevant sample of the parts are inspected instead
of all the parts. Some companies require certification from the part vendor rather
than inspecting parts themselves.
A tolerance must be specified for each dimension so that it can be determined
how accurately the part must be manufactured to be acceptable. The tolerances
that you specify are based on the part’s function and fit.
Unless otherwise stated, the dimensions and tolerances apply at 68 degrees F (20
degrees C) in a free state (not stretched or compressed, etc.). When inspected in
other temperature conditions, the measurements may be appropriately
compensated.
Definitions for Size DesignationYou should become familiar with the size designation terms that apply in
tolerancing.
Feature A physical portion of a part, such as a pin, or a hole, or the
representation of such a feature on a drawing or in a model.
Feature of size The two types of features of size are regular and irregular. A
regular feature of size is a cylindrical or spherical surface, a circular element
(such as the cross section of a cylinder), or a set of two opposed parallel
elements or opposed parallel surfaces that are associated with a directly
toleranced dimension.
Actual local feature The measured value of any individual cross section of a
feature of size.
Nominal size is used for general identification and is usually expressed in
decimals or, less often, common fractions. In Figure 12.3, the nominal size of
both hole and shaft, which is 1.25′′, would be 1 − 1/4′′ or 31.75 mm.
images
12.3 Nominal Size and Actual Size
Allowance is the minimum clearance space (or maximum interference) that is
specified to achieve a fit between two mating parts. In Figure 12.3, the
allowance is the difference between the size of the smallest hole and the size of
the largest shaft. Allowance represents the tightest permissible fit. For clearance
fits this difference will be positive, but for interference fits it will be negative.Variations in Form
The dimensions of the cylinder in Figure 12.1 specify a bilateral tolerance that
allows the part to be +.002 or −.002 from the 1.625 dimension specified. The
drawing or model specifies the cylinder’s shape, and the dimensions and
tolerance specify its size and the allowable variation that the size may have.
But what about imperfections of the form? Some imperfections of form that may
occur in manufacturing cylinders are shown in Figures 12.4–12.7. Of course,
they are greatly exaggerated in the illustration. Because nothing can be made to
exact perfection, some of these types of variations will occur in manufacturing.
The objective of providing a tolerance is to indicate the acceptable amount of
variation so that the parts will still fit and function.

You can think of tolerance as defining a perfect form envelope that the real
produced part must fit inside in order to be acceptable.Tip
You can sometimes notice variations in form by placing a machinists’ scale
along the edge of the part and checking to see whether you can slip a feeler gage
between the scale and the edge of the part.
Tolerance Envelope
The following terms describe the tolerance envelope:
Actual mating envelope (AMC) The envelope toward the outside of the material,
in which the acceptable actual feature must fit. For external parts, like cylinders,
this is the perfect feature at the largest permissible size; for internal features, like
holes, this is the perfect feature at the smallest permissible size.
Actual minimum material envelope This envelope is the counterpart to the
actual mating envelope. For an acceptable external feature, it is the perfect
feature at the smallest permissible size; for an internal feature this is the perfect
feature at the largest permissible size.
Figure 12.8a illustrates the idea of a part fitting inside the perfect form envelope.
The part (a shaft) is represented in green and the actual mating envelope and
actual minimum material envelope are shown as blue areas. The part can be any
size that is no larger than the actual mating envelope and no smaller than the
actual minimum material envelope.
images12.8 (a) Acceptable Fit. (b) Section Showing Fit. (c) Unacceptable Part (extends beyond the actual mating
envelope). (d) Unacceptable Part (extends beyond the actual minimum material envelope). (Variations are
exaggerated for the purpose of illustration.)
Figure 12.8c illustrates a bowed part that extends outside the actual mating
envelope. Figure 12.8d shows a waisted part that extends beyond the actual
minimum material envelope.
Implied Right Angles
When lines or centerlines intersect on a drawing at angles of 90°, it is customary
not to dimension the angle. This situation is called an implied 90° angle. If the
angle is something other than 90°, it must be dimensioned to be understood
clearly.
Implied 90° angles have the same general tolerances applied to them as do any
other angles covered by a general note. The exception is when a geometric
tolerance is used for that feature. When geometric tolerances are specified,
implied 90° or 0° angles between feature centerlines are considered basic
dimensions to which no tolerance applies outside that stated by the geometric
tolerance. Figure 12.9 shows a simple dimensioned drawing with a general
tolerance note. The tolerance of plus or minus 1° applies to the implied 90°
angles as well as to the dimensioned angles in the drawing. Figure 12.10 shows a
drawing where implied 90° angles are controlled by the tolerance noted in the
title block. Later in this chapter you will learn to use geometric dimensioning
and tolerancing to control angles with greater precision.
images12.9 Noted tolerances apply to implied 90° angles the same as they do to dimensioned angles that are not
noted otherwise.

Fits between Mating Parts
Fit is the range of tightness or looseness resulting from the allowances and
tolerances in mating parts. The loosest fit, or maximum clearance, occurs when
the smallest internal part (shaft) is in the largest external part (hole), as shown in
Figure 12.11a. The tightest fit, or minimum clearance, occurs when the largest
shaft is in the smallest hole, as shown in Figure 12.11b. The difference between
the largest allowable shaft size and the smallest allowable hole size (0.002′′ in
this case) is the allowance. There are three general types of fits between parts.
images
12.11 (a) Loosest and (b) Tightest Fit
Clearance Fit A clearance fit occurs when an internal part fits into an external
part with space (or clearance) between the parts. In Figure 12.12, the largest
shaft is 1.248′′ and the smallest hole is 1.250′′, giving a minimum space
(allowance) of .002′′ between the parts. In a clearance fit, the allowance is
always positive.
images
12.12 Clearance FitInterference Fit An interference fit occurs when the internal part is larger than
the external part, so the parts must be forced together. In Figure 12.13, the
smallest shaft is 1.2513′′ and the largest hole is 1.2506′′, so the interference of
metal between parts is at least .0007′′. For the largest shaft and smallest hole, the
interference is 0.0019′′. In an interference fit, the allowance is always negative.
images
12.13 Interference Fit
Transition Fit A transition fit refers to either a tight clearance or interference. In
Figure 12.14 the smallest shaft, 1.2503′′, will fit into the largest hole, 1.2506′′.
But the largest shaft, 1.2509′′, will have to be forced into the smallest hole, 
1.2500′′.
images
12.14 Transition Fit
Line fit is sometimes used to indicate limits that are specified so that a clearance
or surface contact results when mating parts are assembled.
Specifying Fit Using Limit Dimensions
Limit dimensions are a method of directly specifying tolerance by providing
dimensions for the upper and lower limits of the feature’s size. The high limit
(maximum value) is placed above the low limit (minimum value) in place of the
dimension value.In the example shown in Figure 12.15, the actual hole may not be less than 
1.250′′ and not more than 1.251′′. These are the limits for the dimension, and
the difference between them (.001′′) is the tolerance, as is indicated in Figure
12.16a.
images
12.15 Specifying Fit through Limit Dimensions
images
12.16 Fits between Mating Parts
Likewise, the shaft must be between limits 1.248′′ and 1.247′′. The difference
between these limits is .001′′ so the tolerance for the shaft is .001′′. The
minimum clearance is .002′′, so any shaft will fit inside any hole
interchangeably.
In metric dimensions, the limits for the hole are 31.75 mm and 31.78 mm. Their
difference, 0.03 mm, is the tolerance (Figure 12.16b). Similarly, the limits for the
shaft are 31.70 mm and 31.67 mm, and the difference between them, the
tolerance, is 0.03 mm.
When parts are required to fit properly in assembly but are not required to be
interchangeable, they are not always toleranced, but it is indicated on the
drawing that they are to be made to fit at assembly. Figure 12.17 shows an
example of this type of note.
images12.17 Noninterchangeable Fit
Selective Assembly
If allowances and tolerances are specified properly, mating parts are completely
interchangeable, but for close fits, it is necessary to specify very small
allowances and tolerances. The cost of manufacturing parts to such precision
may be very high.
To avoid this expense, either manual or computer-controlled selective assembly
is often used. In selective assembly, all parts are inspected and classified into
several grades according to actual sizes, so that “small” shafts can be matched
with “small” holes, “medium” shafts with “medium” holes, and so on. Figure
12.18 shows variation among the sizes of mating parts at an exaggerated size to
illustrate the general idea.
images
12.18 Selective Assembly (Difference between the sizes of mating parts is exaggerated for visibility.)
Using selective assembly, acceptable fits may be obtained at less expense than
by machining all mating parts to highly accurate dimensions. This method is
often effective when using transition fits, since either clearance or interference is
allowed. The use of selective assembly makes ordering replacement parts
difficult.
images
The inner workings of a watch are an example of parts that must fit precisely to work. (alextan8/Shutterstock.)Hole System
Reamers, broaches, and other standard tools are often used to produce holes, and
standard plug gages are used to check the actual sizes. In contrast, shafts are
easily machined down to any size desired. Therefore, toleranced dimensions are
commonly determined using the hole system, in which the minimum hole is
taken as the feature size for the design. Then, the allowance is determined, and
tolerances are applied. Figure 12.19 shows a CAD model where several shafts
assemble into different holes. Figure 12.20 shows the fit between two parts sized
based on the hole diameter.
images
12.19 Tolerances are usually based on the hole size, because holes are usually formed using standard tool
sizes.
images
12.20 Hole System
Shaft System
In some industries, such as textile machinery manufacturing, which use a great
deal of cold-finished shafting, the shaft system is used. It is advantageous when
several parts having different fits are required on a single shaft, as in Figure
12.21, or when the shaft for some reason can’t be machined to size easily. This
system should be used only when there is a reason for it. In this system, the
maximum shaft is taken as the feature size for the design and an allowance for
each mating part is assigned, then tolerances are applied.images
12.21 When several parts fit to a single shaft, tolerances may be based on the shaft size.
In Figure 12.22, the maximum size of the shaft, .500′′, is the feature size for the
design. For a clearance fit, an allowance of .002′′ is decided on, giving the
minimum hole size of .502′′. Tolerances of .003′′ and .001′′, respectively, are
applied to the hole and the shaft to obtain the maximum hole, .505′′, and the
minimum shaft, .499′′. The minimum clearance is the difference between the
smallest hole and the largest shaft, and the maximum clearance is the difference
between the largest hole and the smallest shaft.
images
12.22 Shaft System
In the case of an interference fit, the minimum hole size is found by subtracting
the desired allowance from the nominal shaft size.
Step by Step
Using the Hole System
images
images Determine where mating parts fit. Because the hole will be machined
with a standard-size tool, its size will be used to determine the fit. In the figure
shown, the minimum size of the hole, .500′′, is used.images Determine the type of fit and apply the allowance. For a clearance fit,
an allowance of .002′′ is subtracted from the hole size, making the maximum
shaft size .498′′, because it is easier to machine the shaft down to a smaller size
than to apply the allowance to the hole.
images Apply the tolerance. Tolerances of .002′′ and .003′′, in this example,
are applied to the hole and the shaft, respectively, to obtain the maximum hole of
.502′′ and the minimum shaft of .495′′. Thus, the minimum clearance is the
difference between the smallest hole and the largest shaft, .002, and the
maximum clearance is the difference between the largest hole and the smallest
shaft, .007.
Interference Fit
images
In the case of an interference fit, find the maximum shaft size by adding the
desired allowance (the maximum interference) to the hole size.
In the figure at left, the hole size is 1.2500′′. The maximum interference decided
on was .0019′′, which when added to the hole size gives 1.2519′′ as the largest
shaft size.
Manufacturing to One Millionth of an InchGage blocks, used for inspection and calibration, must be manufactured to
extremely precise tolerances.
Gage blocks, also known as “Jo blocks” are made from steel, chrome, or ceramic
and lapped and honed to accuracies of even just a few millionths of an inch
(0.0000254 mm). These precise blocks are used in calibration and inspection.
They are often used with a sine bar to measure angles precisely. Using the
equation sin angle = height / distance,
the fixed distance of the sine bar, and setting the precise height by raising one
end of the sine bar on a gage block or stack of gage blocks, you can find precise
angles. When the angle is known, the height of the gage blocks can be calculated
from the equation. Often, tables are used to look up the needed height quickly to
produce the required angle for setting up a machine.
Gage blocks are finished so precisely (flatness of around 1 microinch) that they
“ring” when slowly slid together and aligned. These blocks are not magnetic.
There is some debate as to the exact combination of air pressure, surface tension
from the light film of oil or water vapor on the gage blocks, and/or the
interchange of electrons between atoms of the surfaces of the two blocks that
creates an attractive molecular force that holds the blocks together.

12.1 Specifying TolerancesEvery dimension on a drawing should have a tolerance, either direct or by a
tolerance note. The primary ways to indicate tolerances in a drawing are
A general tolerance note listed in a note or a table;
A note providing a tolerance for a specific dimension;
A reference on the drawing to another document that specifies the required
tolerances;
Adding limit tolerances to dimensions;
Adding direct plus/minus tolerances to dimensions; and
Geometric tolerances.
Many of these tolerancing methods can be used in combination in the same
drawing.
12.2 General Tolerance Notes
General notes are usually located in the lower right corner of the drawing sheet
near the title block. Often, general tolerance notes are included in the title block
itself. For example, a general tolerance note might state, ALL TOLERANCES 
±1mm
UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.
ANGLES ±1 DEGREE.
This indicates that for a dimension value written as 25, for example, any
measurement between 24 and 26 on the actual part would be acceptable.Many companies have standard title blocks they insert into CAD drawing files
containing general tolerancing standards for the type of production that is
common to their industry. Figure 12.23 shows an example of a general tolerance
note.
images
12.23 General Tolerance Note
Another way general tolerances are stated is with a table on or near the title
block indicating the tolerance by the number of digits used in the dimension, as
shown in Figure 12.24. For example:
images
12.24 General Tolerance in Title Block (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)
DIGITS TOLERANCE
.X ±. 2 INCH
.XX ±. 02 INCH
.XXX ±.001 INCH
X° ±. 1
∘This type of table indicates that single-place decimal dimensions have a
tolerance of ±.2. For example, a dimension value written as 3.5 could range
anywhere from 3.3 to 3.7 on the actual part and still be acceptable. A dimension
written as 3.55 could range from 3.53 to 3.57 on the actual part. And a value
written as 3.558 could range from 3.557 to 3.559 and be acceptable. It is
uncommon to see more than three decimal places listed for inch drawings,
because precisions of ±.0001 are very high precision manufacturing and would
be unlikely to be indicated merely by a general tolerance note.
12.3 Limit Tolerances
Limit tolerances state the upper and lower limits for the dimension range in
place of the dimension values, as shown in Figure 12.25. Figure 12.26 shows
examples of limit tolerances in a drawing. The upper value is always placed
above the lower value. In single-line note form, the low limit precedes the high
limit, and the two values are separated by a dash, for example, 29–32.
images
12.25 Methods of Stating Limits
images
12.26 Limit Dimensions
Single-Limit Dimensioning
It is not always necessary to specify both limits when you use a single-limit
tolerance. The note MIN or MAX is placed after a number to indicate theminimum or maximum dimension desired when other elements of design
determine the other unspecified limit. For example, a thread length may be
dimensioned as 1.500 MIN FULL THD or a radius dimensioned as R .05
MAX. Other applications of single-limit dimensions include depths of holes and
chamfers.
12.4 Plus-or-Minus Tolerances
In this method the basic size is followed by a plus-or-minus expression for the
tolerance (Figure 12.27). The result can be:
images
12.27 Plus/Minus Tolerance Expression
Unilateral when the tolerance applies in only one direction so that one value
is zero; or
Bilateral when either the same or different values are added and subtracted.
If two unequal tolerance numbers are given—one plus and one minus—the plus
value is placed above the minus. One of the numbers may be zero. If the plus
value and minus value are the same, a single value is given, preceded by the
plus-or-minus symbol (±), as shown in Figure 12.28.

The unilateral system of tolerances allows variations in only one direction from
the nominal size. This method is advantageous when a critical size is approached
as material is removed during manufacture, as in the case of close-fitting holes
and shafts. In Figure 12.27a, the nominal size is 1.878′′ (47.70 mm). The
tolerance of .002′′ (0.05 mm) is all in one direction—toward the smaller size. If
the dimension is for a shaft diameter, the nominal size of 1.878′′ (47.70 mm) is
nearer the critical size, so the tolerance is subtracted from the critical size. A
unilateral tolerance is always all plus or all minus, but the zeros for the other
tolerance value should be shown as in Figure 12.27a.
The bilateral system of tolerances allows variations in both directions from the
nominal. Bilateral tolerances are usually given for location dimensions or any
dimensions that can be allowed to vary in either direction. In Figure 12.27b, the
nominal size is 1.876′′ (47.65 mm), and the actual local feature may be larger by
.002′′ (0.05 mm) or smaller by .001′′ (0.03 mm). If equal variation in both
directions is allowed, the plus-or-minus symbol is used, as shown in Figure
12.28.
Angular tolerances are usually bilateral and given in terms of degrees, minutes,
and seconds (Figure 12.30), unless geometric dimensioning and tolerancing is
used. Limit tolerances for angles, as shown in Figure 12.30b, are less commonly
used.

12.30 Angular Tolerances12.5 Tolerance Stacking
It is very important to consider the effect of one tolerance on another. When the
location of a surface is affected by more than one tolerance value, the tolerances
are cumulative. In some cases, for functional reasons, it may be desirable to
define dimensions (such as X, Y, and Z shown in Figure 12.31a) chain fashion,
without regard to the overall width of the part. This allows the tolerance to
accumulate or “stack up.” If the overall width dimension is shown in Figure
12.31a, the part is controlled in too many different ways—it is overdimensioned.
In such cases, if it is shown, the overall dimension should be a reference
dimension placed inside parentheses to indicate that it is for reference only.
images
12.31 Chained versus Baseline Dimensioning
In other cases it may be desired to hold two dimensions (such as X and Y in
Figure 12.31a) and the overall width of the part closely by giving the overall
width dimension. In that case, a dimension such as Z should be omitted or given
as a reference dimension only. As a rule, it is best to dimension each surface so
that it is affected by only one dimension. This can be done by referring all
dimensions to a single datum surface, such as B shown in Figure 12.31b.
Chained or Continuous Dimensioning
When dimensions are specified as a chain, the tolerances for the part may add
up. A chained dimension uses the end of one dimension as the beginning of the
next. Tolerance stacking refers to the way the tolerance for one dimension isadded to the next dimension in the chain and so on from one feature to the next,
resulting in a large variation in the location of the last feature in the chain. Figure
12.31a illustrates this effect where the surface labeled A is dimensioned chain
fashion. Consider the location of the right end surface relative to the left end of
the part. When features X, Y, and Z are at their maximum size, the surface at the
right end of the part can vary within a .015-wide zone. Tolerance stacking is not
necessarily bad, if that is the intent for the relative locations of the features. You
should be aware of the effect that tolerance has on chained dimensions and
specify the tolerances this way only when you want the tolerance to accumulate.
Baseline Dimensioning
Baseline dimensioning locates a series of features from a common base feature.
Tolerances do not stack up because dimensions are not based on other toleranced
dimensions. Figure 12.31b illustrates how the same part in Figure 12.31a could
be dimensioned using baseline dimensioning. Baseline dimensioning can make it
easy to inspect the part, because features are measured from a common base
feature. Dimensioning from a zero point as the base feature can also be a useful
technique for dimensioning parts for NC machining.
12.6 Using American National Standard Limits and Fit Tables
The American National Standards Institute has issued ANSI B4.1, Preferred
Limits and Fits for Cylindrical Parts, defining terms and recommending
preferred standard sizes, allowances, tolerances, and fits in terms of the decimal
inch. This standard gives a series of standard classes of fits on a unilateral-hole
basis so that the fit produced by mating parts of a class of fit will produceapproximately similar performance throughout the range of sizes. These tables
give standard allowances for any given size or type of fit; they also prescribe the
standard limits for the mating parts that will produce the fit.
The tables are designed for the hole system (see Appendices 2–6). For coverage
of the metric system of tolerances and fits, see Appendices 8–11.
Table 12.1 gives the three general types of fits, the five subtypes, their letter
symbols, and descriptions.
Table 12.1 General Fit Types and Subtypes

Clearance RC Running or
sliding fits
Running and sliding fits
(Appendix 2) are intended to
provide a similar running
performance, with suitable
lubrication allowance,
throughout the range of sizes.
The clearances for the first two
classes, used chiefly as slide
fits, increase more slowly with
diameter than the other
classes, so that accurate
location is maintained even at
the expense of free relative
motion.
Locational LC Clearance

Locational fits (Appendices 3–

Interference FN Force or
shrink fits
Force or shrink fits (Appendix
6) constitute a special type of
interference fit, normally
characterized by the
maintenance of constant bore
pressures throughout the range
of sizes. The interference
therefore varies almost directly
with diameter, and the
difference between its
minimum and maximum value
is small to maintain the
resulting pressures within
reasonable limits.
In the fit tables for each class of fit, the range of nominal sizes of shafts or holes
is given in inches. To simplify the tables and reduce the space required to present
them, the other values are given in thousandths of an inch as in the example
shown in Figure 12.32. Minimum and maximum limits of clearance are given;
the top number is the least clearance, or the allowance, and the lower number themaximum clearance, or loosest fit. Then, under the heading “Standard Limits,”
are the limits for the hole and for the shaft that are to be applied to the nominal
size to obtain the limits of size for the parts, using the hole system.

12.7 Tolerances and Machining Processes
Tolerances should be as generous as possible and still permit satisfactory use of
the part. The tighter the tolerance, the more expensive it is to manufacture the
part. Great savings can be gained from the use of less expensive tools, from
lower labor and inspection costs, and from reduced scrapping of material.
Table 12.2 is a chart to be used as a general guide to the tolerances achievable by
the indicated machining processes. You can convert these to metric values by
multiplying by 25.4 and rounding to one fewer decimal places.

12.8 Metric System of Tolerances and Fits
The preceding material on limits and fits between mating parts applies for both
systems of measurement. A system of preferred metric limits and fits by the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is in the ANSI B4.2
standard. The system is specified for holes, cylinders, and shafts, but it is also
adaptable to fits between parallel surfaces of such features as keys and slots. The
following terms for metric fits, shown in Figure 12.33a, are somewhat similar to
those for decimal inch fits:

Basic size/nominal size Basic size/ nominal size is the size from which limits or
deviations are assigned. Basic sizes, usually diameters, should be selected from atable of preferred sizes, as shown in Table 12.3. Figure 12.34 shows examples of
preferred and accceptable methods of specifying tolerances on a drawing.

12.34 Specifying Tolerances with Symbols for Mating Parts
Deviation The deviation is the difference between the basic size and the hole or
shaft size. This is equivalent to the tolerance in the decimal-inch system.
Upper deviation The upper deviation is the difference between the basic size
and the permitted maximum size of the part. This is comparable to the maximum
tolerance in the decimal-inch system.
Lower deviation The lower deviation is the difference between the basic size and
the minimum permitted size of the part. This is comparable to the minimum
tolerance in the decimal-inch system.Fundamental deviation The fundamental deviation is the deviation closest to
the basic size. This is comparable to the minimum allowance in the decimal-inch
system.
Tolerance The tolerance is the difference between the permitted minimum and
maximum sizes of a part.
International tolerance grade The international tolerance grade (IT) is a set of
tolerances according to the basic size that provides a uniform level of accuracy
within the grade. For example, in the dimension 50H9 for a close-running fit in
Figure 12.34, the IT grade is indicated by the numeral 9. (The letter H indicates
that the tolerance is on the hole for the 50 mm dimension.) In all, there are 18 IT
grades—IT01, IT0, and IT1 through IT16 (see Figures 12.35 and 12.36 for IT
grades related to machining processes and for the practical use of the IT grades).

images
12.36 Practical Use of the International Tolerance Grades
Tolerance zone The tolerance zone refers to the relationship of the tolerance to
the basic size. It is established by a combination of the fundamental deviation
indicated by a letter and the IT grade number. In the dimension 50H8, for the
close-running fit, the H8 specifies the tolerance zone, as shown in Figure 12.37.
images12.37 Applications of Definitions and Symbols to Holes and Shafts (Reprinted from ASME B4.2-1978, by permission
of The American Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.)
Hole system The hole system of preferred fits uses the basic diameter as the
minimum size. For the generally preferred hole-basis system, shown in Figure
12.37a, the fundamental deviation is specified by the uppercase letter H.
Shaft system The shaft system of preferred fits is a system in which the basic
diameter is the maximum size of the shaft. The fundamental deviation is given
by the lowercase letter f, as shown in Figure 12.37b.
Interference fit An interference fit results in an interference between two mating
parts under all tolerance conditions.
Transition fit A transition fit results in either a clearance or an interference
condition between two assembled parts.
Tolerance symbols Tolerance symbols are used to specify the tolerances and fits
for mating parts, as shown in Figure 12.37c. For the hole-basis system, the 50
indicates the diameter in millimeters, the capital letter H indicates the
fundamental deviation for the hole, and the lowercase letter f indicates the
deviation for the shaft. The numbers following the letters indicate the IT grade.
Note that the symbols for the hole and shaft are separated by a slash. Tolerance
symbols for a 50-mm-diameter hole may be given in several acceptable forms, as
shown in Figure 12.38. The values in parentheses are for reference only and may
be omitted. For upper and lower limit values, see Appendix 8.

12.9 Preferred Sizes
The preferred basic sizes for computing tolerances are given in Table 12.3. Basic
diameters should be selected from the “First Choice” column, because these are
readily available stock sizes for round, square, and hexagonal products.
12.10 Preferred Fits
The symbols for either the hole-basis or shaft-basis preferred fits (clearance,
transition, and interference) are given in Table 12.4. Fits should be selected from
this table for mating parts where possible.

*The transition and interference shaft-basis fits shown do not convert to exactly
the same hole-basis fit conditions for basic sizes in the range from 0 through 3mm. Interference fit P7/h6 converts to a transition fit H7/p6 in the above size
range.
For values corresponding to the fits, see Appendices 8–11. Although second- and
third-choice basic-size diameters are possible, they must be calculated from
tables not included in this text. For the generally preferred hole-basis system,
note that the ISO symbols range from H11/c11 (loose running) to H7/u6 (force
fit). For the shaft-basis system, the preferred symbols range from C11/h11 (loose
fit) to U7/h6 (force fit).
Suppose that you want to use the symbols to specify the dimensions for a free￾running (hole-basis) fit for a proposed diameter of 48 mm. Because 48 mm is not
listed as a preferred size in Table 12.3, the design is altered to use the acceptable
50-mm diameter when possible. From the preferred fit descriptions in Table
12.4, the free-running (hole-basis) fit is H9/d9. To determine the upper and lower
deviation limits of the hole as given in the preferred hole-basis table (Appendix
8) follow across from the basic size of 50 to H9 under “Free Running.” The
limits for the hole are 50.000 and 50.062 mm. The upper and lower limits of
deviation for the shaft are found in the d9 column under “Free Running.” They
are 49.920 and 49.858 mm, respectively. Limits for other fits are established in a
similar way.
Limits for the shaft-basis dimensioning are determined similarly from the
preferred shaft-basis table in Appendix 10. Refer to Figures 12.34 and 12.38 for
acceptable methods of specifying tolerances by symbols on drawings. A single
note for the mating parts (free-running fit, hole basis) would be H9/d9, as was
shown in Figure 12.37.12.11 Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing
Geometric tolerances state the maximum allowable variations of a form or its
position from the perfect geometry implied on the drawing. The term
“geometric” refers to various forms, such as a plane, a cylinder, a cone, a square,
or a hexagon. Theoretically, these are perfect forms, but because it is impossible
to produce perfect forms, it may be necessary to specify the amount of variation
permitted. Geometric tolerances specify either the diameter or the width of a
tolerance zone within which a surface or the axis of a cylinder or a hole must be
if the part is to meet the required accuracy for proper function and fit. When
tolerances of form are not given on a drawing, it is assumed that regardless of
form variations, the part will fit and function satisfactorily.
Tolerances of form (shape) and position (location) control such characteristics as
straightness, flatness, parallelism, perpendicularity (squareness), concentricity,
roundness, angular displacement, and so on.
Methods of indicating geometric tolerances by means of geometric characteristic
symbols, rather than by traditional notes, are recommended. See the latest
dimensioning and tolerancing standard, ANSI/ASME Y14.5, for more complete
coverage.
12.12 Symbols for Tolerances of Position and Form
Because traditional notes for specifying tolerances of position (location) and
form (shape) may be confusing or unclear, may require too much space, and may
not be understood internationally, most multinational companies have adoptedsymbols for such specifications (ANSI/ASME Y14.5). These symbols, shown in
Table 12.5, provide an accurate and concise means of specifying geometric
characteristics and tolerances in a minimum of space. A feature control frame
(Figure 12.39) specifies the tolerance for the geometric characteristic to be
controlled and any modifying conditions (see Table 12.6) that are required. The
symbols may be supplemented by notes if the precise geometric requirements
cannot be conveyed by the symbols.

12.40 Use of Symbols for Tolerance of Position and Form (Reprinted from ASME Y14.5M-1994 (R2004), by permission
of The American Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.)
Basic dimension symbols use an enclosing frame, as shown in Figure 12.40a and
below. The basic dimension is the value used to describe the theoretically exact
size, shape, or location of a feature. It is the basis from which permissible
variations are established either by specifying tolerances on other dimensions, by
tolerances given in notes, or by using feature control frames.
imagesDatum identifying symbols consist of a capital letter in a square frame and a
leader line extending from the frame to the concerned feature and terminating
with a triangle. The triangle may be filled or not filled. Letters of the alphabet
(except I, O, Q, X, Y, and Z) are used as datum identifying letters.
images images
Supplementary symbols include the symbols for MMC (maximum material
condition—or minimum hole diameter, maximum shaft diameter) and LMC
(least material condition—or maximum hole diameter, minimum shaft diameter),
as shown in Figure 12.40c. The abbreviations MMC and LMC are also used in
notes (see also Table 12.6).
When needed, the symbol for diameter precedes the specified tolerance in a
feature control symbol, as shown in Figure 12.40d. For narrative notes, you can
use the abbreviation DIA for diameter.
images
Combined symbols are found when individual symbols, datum reference letters,
and needed tolerances are combined in a single frame, as shown in Figure
12.40e.
imagesForm tolerance is given by a feature control symbol made up of a frame around
the appropriate geometric characteristic symbol plus the allowable tolerance. A
vertical line separates the symbol and the tolerance, as shown in Figure 12.40d.
Where needed, the tolerance should be preceded by the symbol for the diameter
and followed by the symbol for MMC or LMC.
images
Reference to a datum is indicated in the feature control frame by placing the
datum reference letter after either the geometric characteristic symbol or the
tolerance. Vertical lines separate the entries, and where applicable, the datum
reference letter entry includes the symbol for MMC or LMC, as shown in Figure
12.40e.
images
Figure 12.41 shows how geometric dimensioning and tolerance symbols are
applied to a drawing. Understanding datum surfaces and features is important to
the application of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing.

12.13 Datum FeaturesDatum features are used as references to control other features on the part. For
example, when defining the location of a hole, you can specify its distance from
a datum surface on the part. Datums should be geometric features on the actual
part, such as a point or a plane as shown in Figure 12.42. Centerlines on
drawings are not used as datums.
images

Datum Features versus Datum Feature Simulator
Datums are theoretically exact points, axes, lines, or planes. A datum feature is a
physical feature on the part that is being manufactured or inspected. It is
identified on the drawing by a datum feature symbol, such as shown in Figure
12.43. When specifying datum features keep in mind that the feature should
images
12.43 Datum feature symbols identify datum surfaces on a drawing.
Correspond to the mating feature on another part to which the fit is required,
Be readily accessible on the part, and
Be sufficiently large to permit its use for making measurements and
alignments.
Datum features, because they are features of the actual part, are inherently
imperfect. When a part is inspected to determine if it meets the tolerance
requirement specified in relation to a datum, a datum feature simulator is used.The datum feature simulator is a boundary derived from the datum feature. It is
typically the inverse of the datum feature. For example, if the datum feature is a
hole, then the datum feature simulator is a positive cylinder, such as a go/no-go
plug gage.
An example of a physical datum feature simulator is a precisely finished granite
slab on which a part to be inspected is placed. Because physical datum feature
simulators themselves cannot be exactly perfect, the tolerances defined for a
feature must take into account the imperfections in precision gages and fixtures.
Standards for these are specified in ASME Y14.43.
Datum Reference Frame
Imagine trying to measure the location of a hole in an air hockey puck while it is
floating on an air hockey table. That would be difficult! A datum reference
frame provides a framework for eliminating the translations (movement) and
rotations of which the free part is capable.
A datum reference frame is often defined by three mutually perpendicular
planes, used to immobilize the part to be inspected and provide a way to make
accurate and repeatable measurements. The datum feature symbols on the
drawing identify the primary datum, secondary datum, and tertiary datum
(meaning first, second, and third) (Figure 12.43).
The datum reference frame is a theoretical construct that does not exist on the
actual part. It is established from the datum features identified on the part
drawing. Often, a fixture is used where the primary datum surface contacts themeasurement fixture at three points, thus defining a plane. Once the primary
datum plane is established, only two additional contact points are needed to
establish the secondary datum plane. Once the primary and secondary planes are
established, a single additional point will establish the tertiary datum plane (see
Figure 12.44). The datum reference frame is established from the datum feature
simulators, not from the datum features themselves.
images
12.44 (a) Establishing the Datum Reference Frame; (b) Part Immobilized on Datum Reference Frame
Step by Step
Constraining Degrees of Freedom
Datums listed in a feature control frame are applied to constrain degrees of
freedom of the part with respect to a datum reference frame. Datums can be
identified to constrain the degrees of freedom of the part to immobilize it for
inspection.
The free part shown here can translate (move) back and forth in the x, y, and z
directions. It can also have rotations u, v, and w. It is said to have six degrees of
freedom owing to these motions.
images
images If the part rests on datum plane A, the part can no longer move in the z
direction, nor can it rotate in u or v motions. Now it has three degrees offreedom. It can rotate in w, and move in x and y.
images
images Adding datum B further restricts the motion of the part. Now it can no
longer move in the y direction or rotate in w. It has one remaining degree of
freedom, motion in x.

stationary. The x, y, and z axes may be specified on the drawing and in the
feature control frame as needed for clarity.

Datum Targets
Datum targets, as shown in Figure 12.45, can be added to drawings when
necessary to specify where points or areas of contact for the simulated datum
should occur on the part. You can find detailed information on datum targets and
inspection methods in standard geometric dimensioning and tolerancing texts.

12.45 Datum Target SymbolsTable 12.7 shows examples of typical datum features, how the feature is
identified as a datum on the drawing, and a pictorial view of the theoretically
exact datum feature simulator. The final column shows which motions would be
constrained. In the application of a feature control frame, the degrees of freedom
constrained will depend on whether the datum feature is referenced as a primary,
secondary, or tertiary datum feature. The examples in the table show simple
cases with single features.

12.14 Positional Tolerances
Figure 12.46a shows a hole located from two surfaces at right angles to each
other. The center may lie anywhere within a square tolerance zone, with sides
equal to the tolerances. Using coordinate dimensioning, the total variation
allowed along the diagonals of the square is 1.4 times the indicated tolerance. In
contrast, when a circular area is used to specify the allowable variation for the
center’s location, up to 57% more parts may measure acceptable.
images
12.46 Tolerance Zones
If four holes are dimensioned with rectangular coordinates, as in Figure 12.47a,
the tolerance describes a square zone in which the center of the hole must belocated (Figure 12.47b). This square-shaped zone allows the center of the hole to
vary more in the diagonal direction than the stated tolerance value.
images
12.47 Tolerance Zones
In Figure 12.47a, hole A is located from the corner of the part, and the other
three are located from A. The tolerances applied to the locations for hole A result
in a square tolerance zone. The other three holes are located from the previous
hole. Their tolerances produce square zones whose locations vary according to
the actual location of hole A. Two of the many possible zone patterns are shown
in Figures 12.47b and c.
With the dimensions shown in Figure 12.47a, the resulting parts may not fit with
mating parts, even though they meet the drawing tolerances.
Tolerancing features based on their geometry can prevent these problems.
Geometric tolerancing controls the shape of the tolerance zone using geometric
characteristics in the feature control frame. This is also called true-position
dimensioning. Using it, the tolerance zone for holes can be circular, with the size
of the circle depending on the variation permitted from true position as specified
using a feature control frame (see Figure 12.48).
images
12.48 True-Position Dimensioning (Reprinted from ASME Y14.5-2018, by permission of The American Society of Mechanical
Engineers. All rights reserved.)Methods for relating feature control symbols to the feature were shown in Figure
12.41. The following are preferred:
1. Add the symbol to a feature’s note or dimension.
2. Run a leader from the symbol to the feature.
3. Attach the side, end, or corner of the symbol frame to an extension line from
the feature.
4. Attach a side or end of the symbol frame to the dimension line basic to the
feature.
A basic dimension specifies the theoretically exact position of a feature. The
location of each feature, such as a hole, slot, or stud, is given by untoleranced
basic dimensions identified by an enclosing box. True position is usually
established with respect to a datum.
A feature control frame for a positional tolerance describes a cylindrical
tolerance zone with a diameter equal to the positional tolerance and a length
equal to the length of the feature unless otherwise specified (Figure 12.48). The
axis of the hole center must be within the cylindrical zone, as shown in Figure
12.49.
images
12.49 Cylindrical Tolerance Zone (Reprinted from ASME Y14.5-2018, by permission of The American Society of Mechanical
Engineers. All rights reserved.)
The centerline of the hole may coincide with the centerline of the cylindrical
tolerance zone (Figure 12.49a). It may be parallel to it but displaced so that itremains within the tolerance cylinder (Figure 12.49b), or it may be inclined and
remain within the tolerance cylinder (Figure 12.49c).
A positional tolerance specifies that all elements on the hole surface must be on
or outside a cylinder whose diameter is equal to the minimum diameter or the
maximum diameter of the hole minus the positional tolerance diameter, when the
centerline of the cylinder is located at true position.
Special untoleranced basic dimensions locate features at true position, avoiding
tolerance accumulation, as shown in Figure 12.50.
images
12.50 No Tolerance Accumulation
The exact locations of the true positions are given by untoleranced basic
dimensions, ensuring that general tolerances are not applied to them. Basic
dimensions are enclosed in a box to indicate that no tolerance applies to them,
Alternatively, this information can be stated in a clearly worded note, such as
UNTOLERANCED DIMENSIONS ARE BASIC.
Features such as slots may vary on either side of a true-position plane, as shown
in Figure 12.51.
images
12.51 Positional Tolerancing for Symmetry (Reprinted from ASME Y14.5-2018, by permission of The American Society of
Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.)
12.15 Maximum Material ConditionMaximum material condition, or MMC, means that a feature of a finished
product contains the maximum amount of material permitted by the toleranced
dimensions shown for that feature. Holes, slots, or other internal features are at
MMC when at minimum size. Shafts, pads, bosses, and other external features
are at MMC when at their maximum size. A feature is at MMC for both mating
parts when the largest shaft is in the smallest hole and there is the least clearance
between the parts.
In assigning positional tolerance to a hole, consider the size limits of the hole. If
the hole is at MMC, or its smallest size, the positional tolerance is not affected,
but if the hole is larger, the available positional tolerance is greater. In Figure
12.52a, two half-inch holes are shown. If they are exactly .500′′ in diameter
(MMC, or smallest size) and are exactly 2.000′′ apart, a gage made of two round
pins .500′′ in diameter fixed in a plate 2.000′′ apart, as shown in Figure 12.52b,
should fit into them. However, the center-to-center distance between the holes
may vary from 1.993′′ to 2.007′′ as specified by the ∅.007 positional tolerance
in the feature control frame in Figure 12.52a.
images
12.52 Maximum and Minimum Material Conditions—Two-Hole Pattern (Reprinted from ASME Y14.5M-1994
(R2004), by permission of The American Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.)
If the .500′′ diameter holes are at their extreme positions, as in Figure 12.52c,
the pins in the gage would have to be .007′′ smaller, or .493′′ in diameter, to fit
into the holes. If the .500′′ diameter holes are located at the maximum distance
apart, the .493′′ diameter gage pins would contact the inner sides of the holes;
and if the holes are located at the minimum distance apart, the .493′′ diameterpins would contact the outer surfaces of the holes, as shown. If gage-maker’s
tolerances are not disregarded, the gage pins would have to be .493′′ in diameter
and exactly 2.000′′ apart if the holes are .500′′ in diameter, or MMC.
If the holes are .505′′ in diameter—that is, at maximum size—the same .493′′
diameter gage pins at 2.000′′ apart will fit with the inner sides of the holes
contacting the inner sides of the gage pins and the outer sides of the holes
contacting the outer sides of the gage pins, as shown in Figure 12.52d. When the
holes are larger, they may be farther apart and still fit the pins. In this case they
may be 2.012′′ apart, which is beyond the tolerance permitted for the center-to￾center distance between the holes. Similarly, the holes may be as close together
as 1.988′′ from center to center, which again is outside the specified positional
tolerance.
Thus, when holes are at maximum size, a greater positional tolerance becomes
available. Because all features may vary in size, it is necessary to make clear on
the drawing at what basic dimension the true position applies. In many cases,
when the holes are larger, the additional positional tolerance is available without
affecting the function. Parts can still be freely assembled whether or not the
holes or other features are within the specified positional tolerance. This practice
has been recognized and used in manufacturing for years in designing functional
gages, used to inspect parts to ensure fit in the assembly. Keep in mind that
MMC/LMC conditions only make sense applied to true position, straightness,
parallelism, perpendicularity, and angularity geometric tolerances. For other
boundaries, it would not make sense that any tolerance “bonus” would beallowed at the MMC or LMC. If so, you would just adjust the tolerance values
themselves.
To avoid misinterpretation as to whether the MMC applies, it should be clearly
stated by adding MMC symbols to each applicable tolerance on the drawing or
by a document referenced on the drawing. When MMC is not specified on the
drawing with respect to an individual tolerance, datum reference, or both, these
rules apply:
1. Regardless of Feature Size (RFS) and Regardless of Feature Boundary (RFB)
are the default conditions for tolerances unless MMC/MMB or LMC/LMB is
applied to the particular geometric tolerance. RFS means that the tolerance
applies independently of the actual measured size of the feature.
2. No element of the actual feature will extend beyond the envelope of the
perfect form at MMC. Maximum material condition or least material
condition must be specified on the drawing where it is required.
Virtual Condition (VC)
Virtual condition is a construct that applies when an MMC or LMC modifier is
present in the feature control frame. VC is the constant boundary for the feature
of size considering the geometric tolerance specified and the specified MMC or
LMC for the feature. For example, when the feature is a shaft, its virtual
condition is the maximum allowed shaft size plus the tolerance zone. This
considers the largest allowed shaft (MMC) at the most extreme position. If this
fit is acceptable, then smaller shafts in better position will also fit. The VC for afeature with a tolerance noted at MMC is calculated thusly: 
VC of an internal feature = MMC (smallest size) − Geometric Tolerance
VC of an external feature = MMC (largest size) − Geometric Tolerance
Virtual condition is used in calculating “bonus tolerance” and designing
inspection to qualify acceptable parts.
12.16 Tolerances of Angles
Bilateral tolerances have traditionally been given on angles as shown in Figure
12.53. With bilateral tolerances, the wedge-shaped tolerance zone increases as
the distance from the vertex of the angle increases.
images
12.53 Tolerances of Angles
If an angular surface is located by a linear and an angular dimension, as shown
in Figure 12.54a, the surface must lie within a tolerance zone, as shown in Figure
12.54b. The angular zone will be wider as the distance from the vertex increases.
To avoid the accumulation of tolerance farther out from the angle’s vertex, the
basic angle tolerancing method, shown in Figure 12.54c, is recommended. The
angle is indicated as a basic dimension, and no angular tolerance is specified.
The tolerance zone is now defined by two parallel planes, resulting in improved
angular control, as shown in Figure 12.54d.
images12.54 Angular Tolerance Zones (Reprinted from ASME Y14.5-2018, by permission of The American Society of Mechanical
Engineers. All rights reserved.)
Use specific controls such as angular geometric controls or a basic dimension to
prevent general tolerances from applying to implied right angles.
12.17 Form Tolerances for Single Features
Straightness, flatness, roundness, cylindricity, and in some instances, profile, are
form tolerances that apply to single features.
The straightness tolerance specifies a tolerance zone within which an axis or all
points of the considered element must lie (Figure 12.55). Straightness is a
condition in which an element of a surface or an axis is a straight line.
images
12.55 Specifying Straightness (Reprinted from ASME Y14.5-2018, by permission of The American Society of Mechanical
Engineers. All rights reserved.)
The flatness tolerance specifies a tolerance zone defined by two parallel planes
within which the surface or derived median plane must lie (Figure 12.56).
Flatness is the condition of a surface or derived median plane having all
elements in one plane.
images
12.56 Specifying Flatness (Reprinted from ASME Y14.5-2018, by permission of The American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
All rights reserved.)The circularity (roundness) tolerance specifies a tolerance zone bounded by
two concentric circles within which each circular element of the surface must lie
(Figure 12.57). Roundness is a condition of a cone or cylinder where all points
of the surface intersected by any plane perpendicular to a common axis are
equidistant from that axis. For a sphere, all points of the surface intersected by
any plane passing through a common center are equidistant from that center.
images
12.57 Specifying Roundness for a Cylinder or Cone (Reprinted from ASME Y14.5M-1994 (R2004), by permission of The
American Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.)
The cylindricity tolerance specifies a tolerance zone bounded by two concentric
cylinders within which the surface must lie (Figure 12.58). This tolerance applies
to both circular and longitudinal elements of the entire surface. Cylindricity is a
condition of a surface of revolution in which all points of the surface are
equidistant from a common axis. When no tolerance of form is given, many
possible shapes may exist within a tolerance zone (Figure 12.59).

12.59 Acceptable Variations of Form—No Specified Tolerance of Form
The profile tolerance specifies a uniform boundary or nonuniform boundary
(using the unequally disposed symbol) along the true profile within which all
elements of the surface or single elements of the surface must lie (Figures 12.60and 12.61). A profile is an outline of a surface, a shape made up of one or more
features, or a two-dimensional element of one or more features. A digital file or
drawing view defines the true profile.

12.18 Orientations for Related Features
Angularity, parallelism, perpendicularity, and in some instances, profile, are
tolerances that apply to related features. These tolerances control the orientations
of features to one another. Orientation tolerances do not control the location of
the features.
Angularity specifies the condition of a surface, feature’s center plane, or
feature’s axis at a specified angle from a datum plane or datum axis.
Perpendicularity specifies the condition of a surface, feature’s center plane, or
feature’s axis at a right angle from a datum plane or datum axis. This is the same
as angularity when specifying a 90° angle. Either method can be used.
Parallelism specifies the condition of a surface or feature’s center plane
equidistant from a datum plane or for a feature’s axis, equidistant along its length
from one or more datum planes or datum axes.Orientation tolerances must be related to one or more datums. Only the rotational
degrees of freedom are constrained when an orientation tolerance is specified.
Orientation tolerances may specify the following:
A zone defined by two parallel planes at the specified basic angle from, or
perpendicular to, or parallel to one or more datum planes or a datum axis. The
surface or center plane of the feature must lie within this zone.
A zone defined by two parallel planes at the specified basic angle from,
perpendicular to, or parallel to one or more datum planes or a datum axis. The
axis of the feature must lie within this zone.
A cylindrical zone at the specified base angle from, or perpendicular to, or
parallel to one or more datum planes or a datum axis. The axis of the feature
must lie within this zone.
A zone defined by two parallel lines at the specified basic angle from, or
perpendicular to, or parallel to one or more datum planes or a datum axis.
Any line element of the feature must lie within this zone.
The angularity tolerance specifies a tolerance zone defined by two parallel
planes at the specified basic angle from a datum plane or axis within which the
surface or the axis of the feature must lie (Figure 12.62).
images
12.62 Specifying Angularity for a Plane Surface (Reprinted from ASME Y14.5M-1994 (R2004), by permission of The

The parallelism tolerance specifies a tolerance zone defined by two parallel
planes or lines parallel to a datum plane or axis, respectively, within which thesurface or axis of the feature must lie (Figures 12.63–12.65). Also, a parallelism
tolerance may specify a cylindrical tolerance zone parallel to a datum axis within
which the axis of the feature must lie.

images
12.66 Specifying Perpendicularity (Reprinted from ASME Y14.5M-1994 (R2004), by permission of The American Society of
Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.)
The perpendicularity tolerance specifies one of the following:
1. A tolerance zone defined by two parallel planes perpendicular to a datum
plane, datum axis, or axis within which the surface of the feature must lie.
2. A cylindrical tolerance zone perpendicular to a datum plane within which the
axis of the feature must lie.
(Perpendicularity is the condition of a surface, median plane, or axis that is at
90° to a datum plane or axis.)The concentricity tolerance specifies a cylindrical (or spherical for those
applications) tolerance zone whose axis or center point coincides with a datum
axis and within which all cross-sectional axes of the feature being controlled
must lie. Concentricity is the condition in which the median points of all
diametrically opposed elements of a surface of revolution are congruent with a
datum axis.
Tabulated Tolerances
Tabulated tolerances may be used on drawings for a family of similar parts,
where a table shows dimensions and tolerances for different part configurations.
The notation TOL along with the table location for the tolerance is added to the
tolerance block as shown in Figure 12.67.
images

the table where that tolerance is listed. The example shows a portion of a table for a family of similar parts,
where column C has different tolerances for different configurations of the part.
12.19 Using Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing
Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GDT) has evolved over the last 40
years to become an indispensable tool for defining parts and features more
accurately. GDT not only considers an individual part and its dimensions and
tolerances but views that part in relation to its related parts. This allows the
designer more latitude in defining the part’s features more accurately by
considering not only the part’s dimensions but its tolerances at the initial designstage. GDT also simplifies the inspection process. This is accomplished through
the use of ASME standards (ASME-Y14.5), as we have discussed previously.
Individually manufactured parts and components must eventually be assembled
into products. We take for granted that each part of a lawnmower, for example,
will mate properly with its other components when assembled. The wheels will
slip into their axles, the pistons will fit properly into their cylinders, and so on.
Nothing should be too tight or too loose.
Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, therefore, is important to both the
design and manufacturing processes.
Applying GDT principles to the design process requires five steps.
Step 1 Define the part’s functions. It is best to break the part down to its simplest
functions. Be as specific as possible. For example, a lawnmower wheel’s
functions are to (a) give the product mobility; (b) lift the mowing deck off the
ground; (c) add rigidity to the body, and so forth.
Step 2 List the functions by priority. Only one function should have top priority.
This step can be difficult, because many parts are designed to incorporate
multiple functions. In our lawnmower wheel example, the function with top
priority would be to give the product mobility.
Step 3 Define the datum reference frame. This step should be based on your list
of priorities. This may mean creating several reference frames, each based on a
priority on your list. The frame should be set up in either one, two, or three
planes.Step 4 Select controls. In most cases, several controls will be needed (e.g.,
runout, position, concentricity, or roughness). Begin with the simplest control.
By “simplest” we mean least restrictive. Work from the least restrictive to the
most restrictive set of controls.
Step 5 Calculate tolerances. Most tolerances are mathematically based. This step
should be the easiest. Apply MMC, RFS, or LMC where indicated. Avoid
completing this step first; it should always be your final step.
12.20 Tolerances and Digital Product Definition
Dimensioning and tolerancing can take place directly in the 3D digital database.
The electronic file can be transmitted as the digital product definition specifying
the shape, size, and finish to the company that will manufacture and/or assemble
the parts.
When you create a 3D model, it represents the ideal geometric shape of the part.
The part can be manufactured very precisely, but as precision is increased, so is
the price of the part. Adding tolerances to the model informs the manufacturer of
the accuracy that is required on the finished part for it to function in your design
as you intend. Essentially, you need to tell the manufacturer when to stop trying
to achieve the level of perfection that is represented in your model.
When you include annotations in the solid model, the annotation should:
Be in a plane that is clearly associated with the corresponding surface or
view;Be clearly associated with the corresponding model geometry;
Be capable of being printed and meet applicable drawing standards; and
Be possible to display on the screen or turn off.
In general, tolerances and annotations provided directly in the model need to be
interpreted to achieve the result that you intend. A combination of drawings and
the model, only drawings, or a fully annotated model are all available methods
for documenting a design. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.
You should investigate which method is suitable for your use and understand the
applicable standards. See Figure 12.68 for examples of tolerancing in CAD.
Partially dimensioned drawings should note: SEE DATASET FOR FULL
GEOMETRIC DESCRIPTION.

definition. (Reprinted from ASME Y14.41-2003, by permission of The American Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.)
12.21 Computer Graphics
CAD programs generally allow the user to add tolerances to dimension values in
the drawings. Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing symbols, finish marks,
and other standard symbols are typically available as a part of the CAD program
or as a symbol library (see Figures 12.69–12.71).12.69 This dialog box in CAD aids in creating geometric dimensioning and tolerancing symbols. (Autodesk
screen shots reprinted courtesy of Autodesk, Inc.)12.70 SolidWorks software makes it easy to select surface finish symbols. (Courtesy of SolidWorks Corporation.)

12.71 With the tolerance command active, Autodesk Inventor suggests a likely choice for the feature and
datum to use in the Feature Control Frame. You can set other options as needed. Its tolerance advisor
provides information and warnings, such as ”system of units is not compatible with the tolerance standard”
you are using. (Autodesk screen shots reprinted courtesy of Autodesk, Inc.)
Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing has become an essential part of today’s
manufacturing industry. To compete in today’s marketplace, companies are
required to develop and produce products of the highest quality, at lowest cost,
and guarantee on-time delivery. Although considered by most to be a design
specification language, GDT is a manufacturing and inspection language as well,
providing a means for uniform interpretation and understanding by these variousgroups. It provides both a national and international contract base for customers
and suppliers.
Cad at Work
Using Solidworks to Perform a Fit Study
Tolerances are important to consider not just for each individual part but also for
the entire assembly. Tolerance variations may accumulate from feature to feature
of a part, and tolerances may also stack up from part to part in an assembly. One
way to analyze the tolerances in the design of your assembly is to do a fit study.
SolidWorks software is one modeler that has some useful tools for performing a
fit study.
You can use the Interference Detection command in SolidWorks to show you
where any two parts overlap in the model. To perform a fit study, modify the
features of interest so they are at the upper size range of the allowable tolerance.
Then, use the Interference Detection selection to display the dialog box shown
in the figure. Click Calculate to display the names of components that overlap in
the Results portion of the dialog box. Once you have checked the features sized
at the upper extremes of the tolerance limits, set the feature to the lower size
limit, and repeat the interference detection.
You can use SolidWorks to store configurations of each part. You can configure
the model at the maximum material condition and at the minimum and store
both. This allows you to quickly set the part model to a particular case for your
fit study and then check the interferences.As you can imagine, the more complex the assembly, the more valuable this
CAD tool will be to you.
Areas that interfere in the assembly model are highlighted during interference detection. The length of this
wheel lock lever part has been modified to exaggerate the material overlap when this part interferes.

Chapter Summary
Tolerance dimensioning describes the minimum and maximum limits for the
size or the location of a feature.
There are several types of dimensioning tolerances, including limit
dimensions, unilateral tolerances, bilateral tolerances, and geometric
tolerancing.
Hole tolerance systems are the most commonly used tolerance systems
because they assume the hole is nominal size and adjust the shaft toaccommodate the tolerance.
The amount of space between two mating parts at maximum material
condition is called the allowance.
Mating parts with large allowances are classified as having a clearance fit or a
running and sliding fit.
Mating parts with negative allowances are classified as having an interference
fit or force fit.
Mating parts are designed around a nominal size and class of fit. Other
tolerances are calculated from these two values.
High-quality parts are often dimensioned with geometric tolerancing to
ensure that the size, shape, and relative geometric characteristics are properly
defined.
Datums can be used to define which degrees of freedom to restrict to make
accurate and repeatable measurements.
GDT has become an essential part of today’s manufacturing industry. GDT is
not only a design language but an inspection language as well.

location should be accurate to ±.005 and its size accurate to within ±.002.
Exercise 12.3 Add geometric dimensioning and tolerancing symbols to the

bottom surface to .003. (c) Control the tolerance for the 30° angle to .01.imagesExercise 12.4 You have been tasked with mounting a dielectric mirror at a 45°
angle. This will be done by creating a mount out of 6061-T6 aluminum
machined with a 45° face. The face will have a machined counterbore in which
to mount the optic and three bond spots to attach the optic. The specifications for
the design are:
Reference the provided drawing for a stock 1′′ dielectric mirror.
The diameter for the counterbore must be .005′′ to .010′′ larger than the
maximum diameter of the optic.
The optic must sit at a minimum of .010′′ and maximum of .020′′ above the
mounting surface.
The optic will be bonded to the mount using ultraviolet curing adhesive. The
adhesive bond spots will be .100′′ diameter by .050′′ deep, equally spaced
around the perimeter of the optic counterbore.
The center point of the outer surface of the optic will be located 1 ± .05′′
from the bottom of the mount.
The mount will be attached to a laser structure using two 6-32 socket head
cap screws.
Answer these questions:
1. What diameter of counterbore is used to ensure the counterbore is .005′′ to 
.010′′ larger than the maximum diameter of the optic?
2. What depth of counterbore is used to ensure a .010′′/.020′′ protrusion height
of the optic?

Overview
Threaded fasteners are the principal devices used for assembling components. To
speed production time and reduce costs, many new types of fasteners are created
every year. Existing fasteners are also modified to improve their insertion in mass
production. Many companies provide CAD drawings of their fasteners on the
Web. When you are using standard fasteners in your designs, save time by
downloading drawings or models.
Thread is usually dimensioned by giving a thread note in the drawing. This allows
you to combine more information in a compact space.The information in this chapter will prepare you to specify various types of thread
and fasteners and to use the standard methods for representing them in your
drawings.
Understanding Threads and Fasteners
Screw threads are vital to industry. They are designed for hundreds of different
purposes. The three basic applications are:
1. To hold parts together (Figure 13.1).13.1 Thread Used for Attachment (Courtesy of Arthur S. Aubry/Stockbyte/Getty Images.)
2. To provide for adjustment between parts (Figure 13.2).13.2 Thread Used for Adjustment (tritooth/123RF.)
3. To transmit power (Figure 13.3).13.3 Thread Used to Transmit Power (ronen/123RF.)
The shape of the helical (spiral shaped) thread is called the thread form. The
metric thread form is the international standard, although the unified thread form
is common in the United States. Other thread forms are used in specific
applications.
3D CAD software may automatically depict fasteners inserted into the model
using simplified thread representation in drawing views and may assist in creating
proper callouts. The thread specification is a special leader note that defines the
type of thread or fastener. This is an instruction for the shop technician so the
correct type of thread is created during the manufacturing process.
The Standardization of Screw Threads
Once, there was no such thing as standardization. Nuts made by one manufacturer
would not fit the bolts of another. In 1841 Sir Joseph Whitworth started crusadingfor a standard screw thread, and soon the Whitworth thread was accepted
throughout England.
In 1864 the United States adopted a thread proposed by William Sellers of
Philadelphia, but the Sellers nuts would not screw onto a Whitworth bolt or vice
versa. In 1935 the American standard thread, with the same 60° V form of the old
Sellers thread, was adopted in the United States.
Still, there was no standardization among countries. In peacetime it was a
nuisance; in World War I it was a serious inconvenience; and in World War II the
obstacle was so great that the Allies decided to do something about it. Talks began
among the Americans, British, and Canadians, and in 1948 an agreement was
reached on the unification of American and British screw threads. The new thread
was called the Unified screw thread, and it represented a compromise between the
American standard and Whitworth systems, allowing complete interchangeability
of threads in three countries.Sir Joseph Whitworth (Courtesy of National Park Service.)
In 1946 a committee called the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) was formed to establish a single international system of metric screw
threads. Consequently, through the cooperative efforts of the Industrial Fasteners
Institute (IFI), several committees of the American National Standards Institute,
and the ISO representatives, a metric fastener standard was prepared.*For a listing of ANSI standards for threads, fasteners, and springs, see page A-1.
Screw Thread Terms
The following definitions apply to screw threads in general and are illustrated in
Figure 13.4. For additional information regarding specific Unified and metric
screw thread terms and definitions, refer to the appropriate standards.
13.4 Screw Thread Nomenclature
Screw thread A ridge of uniform cross section in the form of a helix on the
external or internal surface of a cylinder.
External thread A thread on the outside of a member, as on a shaft.
Internal thread A thread on the inside of a member, as in a hole.Major diameter The largest diameter of a screw thread (for both internal and
external threads).
Minor diameter The smallest diameter of a screw thread (for both internal and
external threads).
Pitch The distance from a point on a screw thread to a corresponding point on the
next thread measured parallel to the axis. In the United States, the pitch is equal to
1 divided by the number of threads per inch.
Pitch diameter The diameter of an imaginary cylinder passing through the threads
where the widths of the threads and the widths of the spaces would be equal.
Lead The distance a screw thread advances axially in one turn.

Series of thread The standard number of threads per inch for various diameters.
A Historical Thread
An Archimedean Screw (Copyright Morphart Creation/Shutterstock.)
The concept of the screw thread seems to have occurred first to Archimedes, the
third-century-B.C. mathematician who wrote briefly on spirals and designed
several simple devices applying the screw principle. By the first century B.C., the
screw was a familiar element but was crudely cut from wood or filed by hand on a
metal shaft. Not much was heard of the screw thread until the fifteenth century.
Leonardo da Vinci understood the screw principle, and created sketches showing
how to cut screw threads by machine. In the sixteenth century, screws appeared in
German watches and were used to fasten suits of armor. In 1669, the Frenchman
Besson invented the screw-cutting lathe, but this method of production did nottake hold for another century and a half; nuts and bolts continued to be made
largely by hand. Screw manufacturing began in eighteenth-century England,
during the Industrial Revolution.
Screw Thread Forms
The thread form is the cross-sectional shape of the thread. Various forms of
threads are used for different purposes. Figures 13.5–13.7 show some of the
typical thread forms.
Sharp-V thread (60°) is useful for certain adjustments because of the increased
friction resulting from the full thread face. It is also used on brass pipe work
(Figure 13.5a).13.5 Sharp, American National, and Unified Screw Thread Forms
American national thread, with flattened roots and crests, is a stronger thread.
This form replaced the sharp-V thread for general use (Figure 13.5b).
Unified thread is the standard thread agreed on by the United States, Canada, and
Great Britain in 1948. It has replaced the American national form. The crest of the
external thread may be flat or rounded, and the root is rounded; otherwise, the
thread form is essentially the same as the American national. Some earlier
American national threads are still included in the new standard, which lists 11
different numbers of threads per inch for the various standard diameters, togetherwith selected combinations of special diameters and pitches. The 11 series
includes the coarse thread series (UNC or NC), recommended for general use; the
fine thread series (UNF or NF), for general use in automotive and aircraft work
and in applications where a finer thread is required; the extra fine series (UNEF or
NEF), which is the same as the SAE extra fine series, used particularly in aircraft
and aeronautical equipment and generally for threads in thin walls; and the 8
series of 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, and 32 threads with constant pitch. The 8UN or
8N, 12UN or 12N, and 16UN or 16N series are recommended for the uses
corresponding to the old 8-, 12-, and 16-pitch American national threads. In
addition, there are three special thread series—UNS, NS, and UN—that involve
special combinations of diameter, pitch, and length of engagement (Figure 13.5c).
Unified extra fine thread series (UNEF) has many more threads per inch for
given diameters than any series of the American national or unified. The form of
thread is the same as the American national. These small threads are used in thin
metal where the length of thread engagement is small, in cases where close
adjustment is required, and where vibration is great.
Metric thread is the standard screw thread agreed on for international screw
thread fasteners. The crest and root are flat, but the external thread is often
rounded if formed by a rolling process. The form is similar to the American
national and unified threads but with less depth of thread. The preferred metric
thread for commercial purposes conforms to the ISO basic profile M for metric
threads. This M profile design is comparable to the unified inch profile, but the
two are not interchangeable. For commercial purposes, two series of metric
threads are preferred—coarse (general-purpose) and fine—much fewer than
previously used (Figure 13.6a).13.6 Metric, Square, and Acme Screw Thread Forms
Square thread is theoretically the ideal thread for power transmission, since its
face is nearly at right angles to the axis, but owing to the difficulty of cutting it
with dies and because of other inherent disadvantages (such as the fact that split
nuts will not readily disengage), square thread has been displaced to a large extent
by the acme thread. Square thread is not standardized (Figure 13.6b).
Acme thread is a modification of the square thread and has largely replaced it. It
is stronger than the square thread, is easier to cut, and has the advantage of easydisengagement from a split nut, as on the lead screw of a lathe (Figure 13.6c).
Standard worm thread (not shown) is similar to the acme thread but is deeper. It
is used on shafts to carry power to worm wheels.
Whitworth thread was the British standard and has been replaced by the unified
thread. The uses of Whitworth thread correspond to those of the American
national thread (Figure 13.7a).
13.7 Whitworth Standard, Knuckle, and Buttress Screw Thread FormsKnuckle thread is often used on electric bulbs. (Shahril KHMD/Shutterstock.)
Knuckle thread is usually rolled from sheet metal but is sometimes cast. In
modified forms, knuckle thread is used in electric bulbs and sockets, bottle tops,
and the like (Figure 13.7b).
Buttress thread is designed to transmit power in one direction only. It is
commonly used in large guns, in jacks, and in other mechanisms that have high
strength requirements (Figure 13.7c).
A number of different thread forms are defined in various ASME standards that
specify requirements for the design and selection of screw threads. For example,
the old N thread series has been superseded by the UN series.
Thread Pitch
The pitch of any thread form is the distance parallel to the axis between
corresponding points on adjacent threads, as shown in Figure 13.8.13.8 Pitch
For metric threads, this distance is specified in millimeters. The pitch for a metric
thread that is included with the major diameter in the thread designation
determines the size of the thread—for example, as shown in Figure 13.8b.
For threads dimensioned in inches, the pitch is equal to 1 divided by the number
of threads per inch. See Appendix 12 for thread tables giving more information on
standard numbers of threads per inch for various thread series and diameters. For
example, a unified coarse thread of 1′′ diameter has eight threads per inch, and the
pitch P equals 1/8′′(.125′′).
If a thread has only four threads per inch, the pitch and the threads themselves are
quite large, as shown in Figure 13.8a. If there are 16 threads per inch, the pitch is
only 1/6′′(.063′′), and the threads are relatively small, similar to those in Figure
13.8b.
The pitch or the number of threads per inch can be measured with a scale or with
a thread pitch gage (Figure 13.8d).
Thread SeriesASME/ANSI Y14.6, Screw Thread Representation, is a standard for drawing,
specifying, and dimensioning threads on drawings.
A thread series is the detail of the shape and number of threads per inch
composing different groups of fasteners. Table 13.1 shows the thread series for
UN thread. (UNJ and UNR thread series have rounded root contours to aid in
preventing stress concentrations that may result from the flat contour of the
typical UN thread profile. Both are external thread specifications.)
Five series of threads were used in the old ANSI standards:
Coarse thread A general-purpose thread used for holding. It is designated NC
(national coarse).
Fine thread With a greater number of threads per inch, it is used extensively in
automotive and aircraft construction. It is designated NF (national fine).
8-pitch thread All diameters have 8 threads per inch. It is used on bolts for high￾pressure pipe flanges, cylinder-head studs, and similar fasteners. It is designated
8N (national form, 8 threads per inch).
12-pitch thread All diameters have 12 threads per inch. It is used in boiler work
and for thin nuts on shafts and sleeves in machine construction. It is designated
12N (national form, 12 threads per inch).
16-pitch thread All diameters have 16 threads per inch. It is used where necessary
to have a fine thread regardless of diameter, as on adjusting collars and bearing
retaining nuts. It is designated 16N (national form, 16 threads per inch).The helical shape of thread is similar to the striping on a barber pole.

Right-Hand and Left-Hand Threads
A right-hand thread is one that advances into a nut when turned clockwise, and a
left-hand thread is one that advances into a nut when turned counterclockwise, as
shown in Figure 13.9. A thread is always considered to be right-hand (RH) unless
otherwise specified. A left-hand thread is always labeled LH on a drawing.
13.9 Right-Hand and Left-Hand ThreadsThis bottom bracket is used to attach the cranks on a bicycle to the frame. One end has right-hand thread
and the other side left-hand thread so the pedal motion won’t unscrew the bottom-bracket bearing cups.
Single and Multiple Threads
A single thread, as the name implies, is composed of one ridge, and the lead is
therefore equal to the pitch. Multiple threads are composed of two or more ridges
running side by side. As shown in Figures 13.10a–c, the slope is the hypotenuse
of a right triangle whose short side equals .5P for single threads, P for double
threads, 1.5P for triple threads, and so on. This relationship applies to all forms of
threads. In double threads, the lead is twice the pitch; in triple threads, the lead is
three times the pitch, and so on. On a drawing of a single or triple thread, a root is
opposite a crest; in the case of a double or quadruple thread, a root is drawn
opposite a root. Therefore, in one turn, a double thread advances twice as far as a
single thread, and a triple thread advances three times as far. RH double square
and RH triple acme threads are shown in Figures 13.10d and e, respectively.13.10 Multiple Threads
Multiple threads are used wherever quick motion, but not great power, is desired,
as on ballpoint pens, toothpaste caps, valve stems, and so on. The threads on a
valve stem are frequently multiple threads to impart quick action in opening and
closing the valve. Multiple threads on a shaft can be recognized and counted by
observing the number of thread starts on the end of the screw, as shown in Figure
13.11.
13.11 This shaded model of a triple-threaded bolt makes it easy to see the three distinct threads. When you
look at the end view of a bolt, you can count the number of starts.
American National Thread FitsFor general use, three classes of fits between mating threads (as between bolt and
nut) have been established by ANSI.
These fits are produced by the application of tolerances listed in the standard and
are as follows:
Class 1 Fit Recommended only for screw thread work where clearance between
mating parts is essential for rapid assembly and where shake or play is not
objectionable.
Class 2 Fit Represents a high quality of commercial thread product and is
recommended for the great bulk of interchangeable screw thread work.
Class 3 Fit Represents an exceptionally high quality of commercially threaded
product and is recommended only in cases where the high cost of precision tools
and continual checking are warranted.
The standard for unified screw threads specifies tolerances and allowances
defining the several classes of fit (degree of looseness or tightness) between
mating threads. In the symbols for fit, the letter A refers to the external threads
and B to internal threads. There are three classes of fit each for external threads
(1A, 2A, 3A) and internal threads (1B, 2B, 3B). Classes 1A and 1B have generous
tolerances, facilitating rapid assembly and disassembly. Classes 2A and 2B are
used in the normal production of screws, bolts, and nuts, as well as in a variety of
general applications. Classes 3A and 3B provide for applications needing highly
accurate and close-fitting threads.
Metric and Unified Thread FitsSome specialized metric thread applications are specified by tolerance grade,
tolerance position, class, and length of engagement. There are a number of
tolerance grades for metric thread fits. These are based on the diameter of the
thread. The tolerance grade is given as a number and the position is given as a
letter. Upper case letters are used for internal thread (like that on nuts) and lower
case letters are used for external thread (like that on bolts).
Grade 6 is a medium tolerance. A number lower than 6 specifies a tighter, finer
tolerance; a number larger than 6 indicates larger, coarser tolerances, which might
be required for long lengths of thread engagement. A general-purpose application
has a tolerance class of 6H for internal threads and a class of 6g for external
threads. Metric thread tolerance classes of 6H/6g are generally assumed if not
otherwise designated and are used in applications comparable to the 2A/2B inch
classes of fits.
When a double designation is given, such as 5g6g, this indicates separate
tolerance grades for the pitch diameter (given first, 5g) and the major diameter of
the thread (given second, 6g), in this case external thread. A single-tolerance
designation, such as 6H, indicates that both the tolerance grade and position for
the pitch diameter and the minor diameter are the same (in this case internal
thread) so it is listed only once.
The tolerance grade for the minor diameter and for the pitch diameter of internal
thread may be 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8. The major diameter of external thread may be grade
4, 6, or 8 and the external pitch diameter may be grades 3 through 9.The tolerance position is the range of the tolerance from the basic size of the
thread profile. For internal thread, H has a zero fundamental deviation, and G has
a positive fundamental deviation. External thread may be h (zero fundamental
deviation), or e, f, or g, which all have negative fundamental deviations, meaning
that the thread element will be smaller than the basic size, to assure it may be
threaded into the hole.
Three Methods for Drawing Thread
There are three methods of representing screw threads on drawings—the
schematic, simplified, and detailed methods. All three types may be combined on
a single drawing.
Schematic and the more common simplified representations are used to show
threads. The symbols are the same for all forms of threads, such as metric,
unified, square, and acme, but the thread specification identifies which is to be
used.
Detailed representation is a closer approximation of the exact appearance of a
screw thread, in which the true profiles of the thread’s form are drawn; but the
helical curves are replaced by straight lines. The true projection of the helical
curves of a screw thread is rarely used in practice. Detailed representation is
shown in Figure 13.12. Do not use detailed representation unless the diameter of
the thread on the drawing is more than 1′′ or 25 mm and then only to call
attention to the thread when necessary. Whether the crests or roots are flat or
rounded, they are represented by single lines and not double lines. Americannational and unified threads are drawn the same way. Figure 13.13 shows
schematic thread symbols, and Figure 13.14 shows simplified thread symbols.
13.12 Detailed Metric, American National, and Unified Threads
13.13 Schematic Thread Symbols
13.14 Simplified Thread Symbols
Detailed directions for drawing and sketching schematic and simplified thread are
shown on pages 602 and 603.Step by Step
Showing Detailed Thread
 Draw the centerline and lay out the length and major diameter as shown at
right.
 Find the number of threads per inch in the Thread Table for American
National and Unified threads. This number depends on the major diameter of the
thread and whether the thread is internal or external.Find the pitch (P) by dividing 1 by the number of threads per inch. For example,
.75–10 UNC has a major diameter of .75 inches and is 10 threads per inch. The
pitch for metric threads is given directly in the thread designation. For example, in
the designation M20 × 2, the 20 mm diameter thread has a pitch of 2 mm.
Establish the slope of the thread by offsetting the slope line .5P for single threads,
P for double threads, 1.5P for triple threads, and so on. For right-hand external
threads, the slope slants upward to the left; for left-hand external threads, the
slope slants upward to the right.
By eye, mark off even spacing for the pitch. If using CAD, make a single thread
and array the lines using the pitch as the spacing.
 From the pitch points, make crest lines parallel to the slope line. These
should be dark, thin lines. Make two V’s to establish the depth of the thread, and
sketch light guidelines for the root of the thread, as shown. Finish the final 60° V’s. The V’s should be vertical; they should not lean
with the thread.
Make root lines. Root lines will not be parallel to crest lines but should appear
parallel to each other.
 When the end is chamfered (usually 45° with the end of the shaft,
sometimes 30°), the chamfer extends to the thread depth. The chamfer creates a
new crest line, which you make between the two new crest points. It is not parallel
to the other crest lines. When finished, all thread root and crest lines should be
shown thin, but dark.Tip
The thread depth table in Figure 13.15 gives approximate thread depths for a
variety of common diameters. You can use thread depth tables to calculate the
exact depth and spacing, but the calculated thread depth is often too small to
show clearly on the drawing, so it is often shown larger than actual size for
clarity.13.15 Steps for Drawing Thread Symbols—Simplified and Schematic
Step by StepThree Ways to Sketch Thread
Detailed Representation
Detailed representation is the most realistic looking, although it is a symbolic way
of representing thread and does not show the helical shape accurately. Detailed
representation is rarely ever sketched because it is time-consuming to draw the
large number of lines making up its shape. Detailed representation does not
reproduce well when the thread diameter on the sheet of paper is smaller than 1′′
or 25 mm.
 Lightly block in the threaded shaft. Draw a light vertical line to define the
threaded portion. Add lines angled at 45° to represent the chamfer.
 Make light ticks to mark the pitch distances. Sketch 60° V’s representing the thread form.
 Connect crest to crest and root to root and darken in the final lines.
Simplified Representation
Simplified representation uses hidden lines to represent the depth of the thread.
Because the thread depth is different for different pitches or thread series, and can
sometimes be quite small, this hidden line is often shown at 1/16′′ or 2 mm so it
can easily be identified on a sketched or printed drawing. Notice the lines that
represent the chamfer and the end of the threaded length. The chamfer makes it
easier to get the bolt started in the hole. Lightly block in the threaded shaft. Make a light vertical line to define the
threaded portion. Use a light line to mark the thread depth.
 Sketch short dashes for the thread depth, then darken in the final lines.
Schematic Thread Representation
Schematic thread representation uses shorter thick parallel lines to represent the
roots of the thread and longer thin lines to represent the crests. The ends of screws
and bolts are shown chamfered, as they are in detailed and simplified
representation. Distances from crest to crest or root to root are not always shown
accurately; instead they are often shown about 1/8′′ or 3 mm apart to give the
appearance of thread. Lightly block in the threaded shaft. Make a light vertical line to define the
threaded portion. Use a light line to mark the thread depth.
 Use short thick lines to represent the roots and long thin lines to represent
the crests.
13.1 Thread Notes
ASME/ANSI Y14.6, Screw Thread Representation, is a standard for representing,
specifying, and dimensioning screw threads on drawings. Thread notes for metric,
unified, and American national screw threads are shown in Figures 13.16 through
13.19. These same notes or symbols are used in correspondence, on shop and
storeroom records, and in specifications for parts, taps, dies, tools, and gages.13.16 Thread Notes
13.17 Metric Thread Notes
13.18 Thread Notes13.19 Thread Notes
Metric screw threads are designated basically by the letter M (for metric thread)
followed by the thread form and nominal size (basic major diameter) in
millimeters and separated by the symbol × followed by the pitch, also in
millimeters. For example, the basic thread note M10 × 1.5 is adequate for most
commercial purposes, as shown in Figure 13.17. If needed, the class of fit and LH
for left-hand designation is added to the note. (The absence of LH indicates a RH
thread.)
If necessary, the length of the thread engagement is added to the thread note. The
letter S stands for short, N means normal, and L means long. For example, the
single note M10 × 1.5 − 6H/6g − N − LH combines the specifications for
internal and external mating of left-hand metric threads of 10-mm diameter and
1.5-mm pitch with general-purpose tolerances and normal length of engagement.For inch threads based on 60° forms, the thread designation should include (in
order):
Nominal diameter in inches
Number of threads per inch
Letter symbol of the thread series
Number and letter of the thread class
Any qualifying information needed, such as the class of fit or the thread gaging
system
For example:
.750–16 UNF–2A(21)
A sample special thread designation is 1.50–7N-LH.
For multiple-start threads, use this format:
Nominal diameter in inches
Pitch in inches followed by the letter P
Lead in inches followed by the letter L
Number of starts in parentheses
Letter symbol of the thread series
Number and letter of the thread class
Any qualifying information needed, such as the class of fit or the thread gaging
system
For example:.750–.0625P–.1875L (3 STARTS) UNF–2A(21)
Alternatively, the number of threads per inch can be given as is typical, followed
by the lead in inches with the letter L afterward. Finally, the number of starts is
given in parentheses, as in
.750–16–.1875L (3 STARTS) UNF–2A(21).
A thread note for a blind tapped hole is shown in Figure 13.16. A tap drill is sized
to form a hole that will leave enough material for thread to be cut using a tap to
form a threaded hole. In practice the tap drill size and depth are omitted and left
up to the shop. At times it is desirable to state a tolerance range for the size of the
hole prior to threading. This can be stated as follows:
∅.656–.658 BEFORE THD .75–20–NEF–2B
Thread notes for holes are preferably attached to the circular views of the holes.
Thread notes for external threads are preferably given where the threaded shaft
appears rectangular, as shown in Figures 13.18a–d.
When converting typical fractional nominal diameter sizes to decimals, the
decimal equivalent for the major diameter is given to four decimal places
(omitting zero in the fourth place). For example, .1375–32 UNF-2A
Thread notes for unified threads are shown in Figures 13.19c and d. The letters A
and B designate external or internal, respectively, after the numeral designating
the class of fit. If the letters LH are omitted, the thread is understood to be right
hand.The following are some typical thread notes:
9/16–18 UNF–2B
1.75–16 UN–2A
.25–.050P–.015L (3 STARTS) UNC–2A
Acme Thread Notes
ACME screw threads use the following two classes of fit:
G (general-purpose) Provides clearance on the major and minor diameters of the
thread.
C (centralizing) Provides for contact of the major diameters.
For many applications either specification is adequate, but the centralizing fit is
preferred when the load will be transverse to the screw axis, as the thread major
diameters then act as radial bearings. The G designation is not to be confused with
the G used for metric fits. Some typical thread notes are:
1.75–4 ACME–2G
1.75–6 ACME–4C
13.2 External Thread Symbols
Simplified representations for external threads are shown in Figures 13.20a and b.
The threaded portions are indicated by hidden lines parallel to the axis at theapproximate depth of the thread, whether the cylinder appears rectangular or
circular. The depth shown is not always the actual thread depth, just a
representation of it. Use the table in Figure 13.15 for the general appearance of
these lines.
13.20 External Thread Symbols for Simplified Thread
When the schematic form is shown in section, as in Figure 13.21a, show the V’s
of the thread to make the thread obvious. It is not necessary to show the V’s to
scale or to the actual slope of the crest lines. To draw the V’s, use the schematic
thread depth, as shown in Figure 13.16, and determine the pitch by drawing 60°
V’s.
13.21 External Thread Symbols for Schematic Thread
Schematic threads are indicated by alternating long and short lines, as shown in
Figure 13.21b. The short lines representing the root lines are thicker than the longcrest lines. Theoretically, the crest lines should be spaced according to actual
pitch, but this would make them crowded and tedious to draw, defeating the
purpose, which is to save time in sketching them. Space the crest lines carefully
by eye, then add the heavy root lines halfway between the crest lines. Generally,
lines closer together than about 1/16′′ are hard to distinguish. The spacing should
be proportionate for all diameters. You do not need to use these actual
measurements in sketching schematic threads, just use them to get a feel for how
far apart to make the lines.
13.3 Internal Thread Symbols
Internal thread symbols are shown in Figure 13.22. Note that the only differences
between the schematic and simplified internal thread symbols occur in the
sectional views. The representation of the internal schematic thread in section in
Figures 13.22k, m, and o is exactly the same as the external representation shown
in Figure 13.21b. Hidden threads, by either method, are represented by pairs of
hidden lines. The hidden dashes should be staggered, as shown.13.22 Internal Thread Symbols
In the case of blind tapped holes, the drill depth normally is drawn at least three
schematic pitches beyond the thread length, as shown in Figures 13.22d, e, l, and
m. The symbols in Figures 13.22f and n represent the use of a bottoming tap,
when the length of thread is the same as the depth of drill. The thread length you
sketch may be slightly longer than the actual given thread length. If the tap drill
depth is known or given, draw the drill to that depth. If the thread note omits this
information, as is often done in practice, sketch the hole three schematic thread
pitches beyond the thread length. The tap drill diameter is represented
approximately, not to actual size.
Step by Step
Detailed Representation of Acme Threads
Detailed representation of acme threads is used only to call attention when details
of the thread are important and the major diameter is larger than 1′′ or 25 mm on
the drawing. The steps are as follows.
 Make a centerline and lay out the length and major diameter of the thread,
as shown. For U.S. drawings, determine the pitch by dividing 1 by the number of
threads per inch (see Appendix 19). Make construction lines for the root diameter,
making the thread depth P/2. Make construction lines halfway between crest and
root guidelines. Mark off spaces on the intermediate construction lines.
 Through alternate points, make construction lines for the sides of the
threads at 15° (instead of 14.5°). Make construction lines for the other sides of the threads, as shown. For
single and triple threads, a crest is opposite a root; for double and quadruple
threads, a crest is opposite a crest. Finish tops and bottoms of threads.
 Make parallel crest lines.
 Make parallel root lines, and finish the thread profiles. All lines should be
thin and dark.The internal threads in the back of the nut and the external threads on the front
side of the screw will slope in opposite directions.
End views of acme threaded shafts and holes are drawn exactly like those for the
square thread.
13.4 Detailed Representation: Metric, Unified, and American
National Threads
The detailed representation for metric, unified, and American national threads is
the same, because the flats are disregarded.
Internal detailed threads in section are drawn as shown in Figure 13.23. Notice
that for left-hand threads the lines slope upward to the left (Figures 13.23a–c); for
right-hand threads the lines slope up to the right (Figures 13.23d–f).13.23 Detailed Representation—Internal Metric, Unified, and American National
Detailed Internal Square Thread
The internal thread construction is shown in Figure 13.24. Note that the thread
lines representing the back half of the internal threads (because the thread is in
section) slope in the opposite direction from those on the front side of the screw.
13.24 Detailed Representation—Internal Square Threads
Steps in drawing a single internal square thread in section are shown in Figure
13.24. Note in Figure 13.24b that a crest is drawn opposite a root. This is the case
for both single and triple threads. For double or quadruple threads, a crest is
opposite a crest. Thus, the construction in Figures 13.24a and b is the same forany multiple of thread. The differences appear in Figure 13.24c, where the threads
and spaces are distinguished and outlined.
The same internal thread is shown in Figure 13.24e from an external view. The
profiles of the threads are drawn in their normal position, but with hidden lines,
and the sloping lines are omitted for simplicity. The end view of the same internal
thread is shown in Figure 13.24f. Note that the hidden and solid circles are
opposite those for the end view of the shaft.
Detailed External Square Thread
Figure 13.25 is an assembly drawing showing an external square thread partly
screwed into a nut. When the external and internal threads are assembled, the
thread in the nut overlaps and covers up half of the V, as shown at B.
13.25 Square Threads in AssemblySometimes in assemblies the root and crest lines may be omitted from the nut only
portion of the drawing so that it is easier to identify the inserted screw.
Step by Step
Detailed Representation of Square Threads
Detailed representation of external square threads is used only when the major
diameter is over about 1′′ or 25 mm, and it is important to show the detail of the
thread on the finished sketch or plotted drawing. The steps for creating a detailed
square thread are as follows.
 Make a centerline and lay out the length and major diameter of the thread.
For U.S. drawings, determine the pitch (P) by dividing 1 by the number of threads
per inch. For a single right-hand thread, the lines slope upward to the left, and the
slope line is offset as for all single threads of any form. On the upper line, use
spacing equal to P/2, as shown. From the points on the upper line, draw guidelines for the root of the
thread, making the depth as shown.
 Make parallel visible back edges of threads.
 Make parallel visible root lines. All lines should be thin and dark.
Tip
End View of a Shaft
The end view of the shaft illustrated in this Step by Step feature is shown below.
Note that the root circle is hidden. In a sketch, no attempt is made to show the
true projection of any but the major diameter.
If the end of a shaft is chamfered, a solid circle is drawn instead of the hidden
circle.13.5 Threads in AssemblyThreads in an assembly drawing are shown in Figure 13.26. It is customary not to
section a stud or a nut or any solid part unless necessary to show some internal
shapes. Show these items “in the round,” as they would look if they were set in
the hole after the assembly was cut to form the section. When external and
internal threads are sectioned in assembly, the V’s are required to show the
threaded connection.
13.26 Threads in Assembly
13.6 Modeling Thread
Thread is not typically modeled, because this complex helical surface adds greatly
to the complexity and file size of the model without providing much useful
manufacturing information. Many 3D modeling packages allow you to model
thread accurately, but it is better to include this type of information as a note, or if
you require this level of detail in the model, wait to add it after you have worked
out the major details of the design.Sometimes, the major and minor diameters of the thread are represented so they
can be used in checking clearances and interferences. If not, the nominal size (the
general size used to identify the fastener) of the threaded hole or shaft is modeled.
A detailed list of fasteners and their proportions is included in Appendices 15–17.
Sweep a Thread Form
Some modeling software allows you to define the helical path curve using an
equation. Other software provides a helical sweep command that allows you to
enter the number of revolutions and diameter parameters, which can be changed
later.
To model thread:
1. Draw the cross-sectional shape of the thread.
2. Draw the helical path.3. Sweep the cross section along the helical path to form the shape of the thread.
13.7 American National Standard Pipe Threads
The American National Standard for pipe threads, originally known as the Briggs
standard, was formulated by Robert Briggs in 1882. Two general types of pipe
threads have been approved as American National Standard: tapered and straight.
The profile of the tapered pipe thread is illustrated in Figure 13.27. The taper of
the standard tapered pipe thread is 1 in 16, or .75′′ per foot measured on the
diameter and along the axis. The angle between the sides of the thread is 60°. The
depth of the sharp V is .8660p, and the basic maximum depth of the thread is
.800p, where p = pitch. The basic pitch diameters, E0 and E1, and the basic
length of the effective external taper thread, L2, are determined by the formulas
13.27 American National Standard Taper Pipe Thread (Reprinted from ASME B1.20.1-1983 (R1992), by permission of The
American Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.)where D = outer diameter of pipe, E0 = pitch diameter of thread at end of pipe,
E1 = pitch diameter of thread at large end of internal thread, L1 = normal
engagement by hand, and n = number of threads per inch.
ANSI also recommends two modified tapered pipe threads for (1) dry-seal
pressure-tight joints (.880 per foot taper) and (2) rail fitting joints. The former is
used for metal-to-metal joints, eliminating the need for a sealer, and is used in
refrigeration, marine, automotive, aircraft, and ordnance work. The latter is used
to provide a rigid mechanical thread joint as is required in rail fitting joints.
Although tapered pipe threads are recommended for general use, there are certain
types of joints in which straight pipe threads are used to advantage. The number
of threads per inch, the angle, and the depth of thread are the same as on the
tapered pipe thread, but the threads are cut parallel to the axis. Straight pipe
threads are used for pressure-tight joints for pipe couplings, fuel and oil line
fittings, drain plugs, free-fitting mechanical joints for fixtures, loose-fitting
mechanical joints for locknuts, and loose-fitting mechanical joints for hose
couplings.
Pipe threads are represented by detailed or symbolic methods in a manner similar
to that used to represent unified and American national threads. The symbolic
representation (schematic or simplified) is recommended for general use
regardless of the diameter, as shown in Figure 13.28. The detailed method is
E0 = D − (.050D + 1.1)1/n
E1 = E0 + .0625L1
L2 = (.80D + 6.8)1/nrecommended only when the threads are large and when it is desired to show the
profile of the thread, as for example, in a sectional view of an assembly.
13.28 Conventional Pipe Thread Representation
As shown in Figure 13.28, it is not necessary to draw the taper on the threads
unless there is some reason to emphasize it, because the thread note indicates
whether the thread is straight or tapered. If it is desired to show the taper, it is
sometimes shown exaggerated to make it more visible, as shown in Figure 13.28,
where the taper is drawn 1/16′′ per 1′′ on radius (or 0.75′′ per 1′ on diameter)
instead of the actual taper of 1/16′′ on diameter. American National Standard
tapered pipe threads are indicated by a note giving the nominal diameter followed
by the letters NPT (national pipe taper), as shown in Figure 13.29. When straight
pipe threads are specified, the letters NPS (national pipe straight) are used. In
practice, the tap drill size is normally not given in the thread note.13.29 Conventional Representation of American National Standard Tapered Pipe Threads
13.8 Use of Phantom Lines
Use phantom lines to save time when representing identical features, as shown in
Figure 13.30. Threaded shafts and springs may be shortened without using
conventional breaks but must be correctly dimensioned.
13.30 Use of Phantom Lines
13.9 Tapped Holes
The bottom of a drilled hole, formed by the point of a twist drill, is cone-shaped,
as shown in Figures 13.31a and b. When an ordinary drill is used to make holes
that will be tapped, it is referred to as a tap drill. When drawing the drill point,
use an angle of 30° to approximate the actual 31° slope of the drill bit.13.31 Drilled and Tapped Holes
13.32 Standard Bolt and Nut
The thread length is the length of full or perfect threads. The tap drill depth does
not include the cone point of the drill. In Figures 13.31c and d, the drill depth
shown beyond the threads (labeled A) includes several imperfect threads produced
by the chamfered end of the tap. This distance varies according to drill size and
whether a plug tap or a bottoming tap is used to finish the hole.A drawing of a tapped hole finished with a bottoming tap is shown in Figure
13.31e. Blind bottom-tapped holes are hard to form and should be avoided
whenever possible. Instead, a relief with its diameter slightly greater than the
major diameter of the thread is used, as shown in Figure 13.31f. Tap drill sizes for
unified, American national, and metric threads can be found in tables. Tap drill
sizes and lengths may be given in the thread note but are generally left to the
manufacturer to determine. Because the tapped thread length contains only full
threads, it is necessary to make this length only one or two pitches beyond the end
of the engaging screw. In simplified or schematic representation, do not show
threads in the bottoms of tapped holes. This way the ends of the screw show
clearly.
The thread length in a tapped hole depends on the major diameter and the material
being tapped. The minimum engagement length, when both parts are steel, is
equal to the diameter (D) of the thread. Table 13.2 shows different engagement
lengths for different materials.
Table 13.2 Thread Engagement Lengths for Different Materials
Screw Material Part Material Thread Engagement*
Steel Steel D
Steel Cast iron 1.5D
Steel Aluminum 2D*Requirements for thread engagement vary based on the specific materials. Use
these rules of thumb only as guidelines.
Tip
Prevent tap breakage: A chief cause of tap breakage is insufficient tap drill
depth. When the depth is too short, the tap is forced against a bed of chips in the
bottom of the hole. Don’t specify a blind hole when a through hole of not much
greater length can be used. When a blind hole is necessary, the tap drill depth
should be generous.
Clearance holes: When a bolt or a screw passes through a clearance hole, the
hole is often drilled 0.8 mm larger than the screw for screws of 3/8′′ (10 mm)
diameter and 1.5 mm larger for larger diameters. For more precise work, the
clearance hole may be only 1/64′′ (0.4 mm) larger than the screw for diameters
up to 10 mm and 0.8 mm larger for larger diameters.
Closer fits may be specified for special conditions. The clearance spaces on each
side of a screw or bolt need not be shown on a drawing unless it is necessary to
show clearly that there is no thread engagement. When it is necessary to show
that there is no thread engagement, the clearance spaces should be drawn about 
3/64′′ (1.2 mm) wide.
13.10 Bolts, Studs, and Screws
The term bolt is generally used to denote a “through bolt” that has a head on one
end, is passed through clearance holes in two or more aligned parts, and isthreaded on the other end to receive a nut to tighten and hold the parts together, as
shown in Figure 13.33a. A hexagon head cap screw, shown in Figure 13.33b, is
similar to a bolt except it often has greater threaded length. It is often used when
one of the parts being held together is threaded to act as a nut. The cap screw is
screwed on with a wrench. Cap screws are not screwed into thin materials if
strength is desired.
13.33 Bolt, Cap Screw, and Stud
A stud, shown in Figure 13.33c, is a steel rod threaded on one or both ends. If
threaded on both ends, it is screwed into place with a pipe wrench or with a stud
driver. If threaded on one end, it is force-fitted into place. As a rule, a stud is
passed through a clearance hole in one member, is screwed into another member,
and uses a nut on the free end, as shown in Figure 13.33c.
A machine screw is similar to a slotted head cap screw but usually smaller. It may
be used with or without a nut. Figure 13.34 shows different screw head types.13.34 Types of Screw Heads
A set screw is a screw, with or without a head, that is screwed through one
member and whose special point is forced against another member to prevent
motion between the two parts.

Do not section bolts, nuts, screws, and similar parts when drawn in assembly
because they do not have interior detail that needs to be shown.13.11 Standard Bolts and Nuts
American National Standard hexagon bolts and nuts are made in both metric and
inch sizes. Square bolts and nuts, shown in Figure 13.35c, are produced only in
inch sizes. Square heads and nuts are chamfered at 30°, and hexagon heads and
nuts are chamfered at 15°–30°. Both are drawn at 30° for simplicity. Metric bolts,
cap screws, and nuts also come in hexagon form.
13.35 Bolt Proportions (Regular)
Bolt Types Bolts are grouped into bolt types according to use: regular bolts for
general use and heavy bolts for heavier use or easier wrenching. Square bolts
come only in the regular type; hexagon bolts, screws, nuts, and square nuts are
available in both regular and heavy.Metric hexagon bolts are grouped according to use: regular and heavy bolts and
nuts for general service and high-strength bolts and nuts for structural bolting.
Finish Square bolts and nuts, hexagon bolts, and hexagon flat nuts are unfinished.
Unfinished bolts and nuts are not machined on any surface except for the threads.
Hexagon cap screws, heavy hexagon screws, and all hexagon nuts, except
hexagon flat nuts, are considered finished to some degree and have a “washer
face” machined or otherwise formed on the bearing surface. The washer face is 
1/64′′ thick (drawn 1/32′′ so that it will be visible on the plotted drawing), and
its diameter is 1.5 times the body diameter for the inch series.
For nuts, the bearing surface may also be a circular surface produced by
chamfering. Hexagon screws and hexagon nuts have closer tolerances and a more
finished appearance but are not completely machined. There is no difference in
the drawing for the degree of finish on finished screws and nuts.
Proportions Proportions for both inch and metric are based on the diameter (D)
of the bolt body. These are shown in Figure 13.35.
For regular hexagon and square bolts and nuts, proportions are
where W = width across flats, H = head height, and T = nut height.
For heavy hexagon bolts and nuts and square nuts, the proportions are
W = 1

′′(or + 3mm)
H = 2
3 D T = DThe washer face is always included in the head or nut height for finished hexagon
screw heads and nuts.
Threads Square and hex bolts, hex cap screws, and finished nuts in the inch series
are usually Class 2 and may have coarse, fine, or 8-pitch threads. Unfinished nuts
have coarse threads and are Class 2B. For diameter and pitch specifications for
metric threads, see Appendix 15.
Thread lengths For bolts or screws up to 6′′ (150 mm) long,
Threadlength = 2D + 1
4
′′(or + 6mm)
For bolts or screws over 6′′ in length,
Threadlength = 2D + 1
2
′′(or + 12mm)
Fasteners too short for these formulas are threaded as close to the head as
practical. For drawing purposes, use approximately three pitches. The threaded
end may be rounded or chamfered, but it is usually drawn with a 45° chamfer
from the thread depth, as shown in Figure 13.35.
Bolt Lengths Bolt lengths have not been standardized because of the endless
variety required by industry. Short bolts are typically available in standard length
increments of 1/4′′ (6 mm), and long bolts come in increments of 1/2′′ to 1′′ (12
to 25 mm). For dimensions of standard bolts and nuts, see Appendix 15.
13.12 Drawing Standard BoltsDetail drawings show all the necessary information defining the shape, size,
material, and finish of a part. Standard bolts and nuts do not usually require detail
drawings unless they are to be altered (for example, by having a slot added
through the end of a bolt), because they are usually stock parts that can easily be
purchased, but you often need to show them on assembly drawings, which you
will learn more about in Chapter 14.
Templates are available to help you add bolts quickly to sketches, or you can use
the dimensions from tables if accuracy is important, as in figuring clearances. In
most cases, a quick representation, where proportions are based on the body
diameter, is sufficient. Three typical bolts illustrating the use of these proportions
are shown in Figure 13.35.
Many CAD systems have fastener libraries that you can use to add a wide variety
of nuts and bolts to your drawings. Often, these symbols are based on a diameter
of 1 unit so that you can quickly figure a scale at which to insert them. Other
systems prompt for the diameter and lengths and create a symbol to your
specifications. In 3D models, when nuts and bolts are represented, the thread is
rarely shown because it adds to the complexity and size of the drawing and is
difficult to model. The thread specification is annotated in the drawing.
Generally, bolt heads and nuts should be drawn “across corners” in all views,
regardless of projection. This conventional violation of projection is used to
prevent confusion between the square and hexagon heads and nuts and to show
actual clearances. Only when there is a special reason should bolt heads and nuts
be drawn across flats, as shown in Figure 13.36.13.36 Bolts “Across Flats”
13.13 Specifications for Bolts and Nuts
In specifying bolts in parts lists, in correspondence, or elsewhere, the following
information must be covered in order:
1. Nominal size of bolt body
2. Thread specification or thread note
3. Length of bolt
4. Finish of bolt
5. Style of head
6. Name
Example (complete decimal inch).75 − 10UNC − 2A × 2.5 STAINLESS STEEL HEXAGON CAP SCREW
Example (abbreviated decimal inch)
.75 − 10UNC × 2.5 SS HEXCAP SCR
Example (metric)
M14 − 2 × 20 SS HEXCAP SCR
For either bolts or nuts, REGULAR or GENERAL PURPOSE are assumed if
omitted from the specification. If the heavy series is intended, the word HEAVY
should appear as the first word in the name of the fastener. Likewise, HIGH
STRENGTH STRUCTURAL should be indicated for such metric fasteners and
the particular grade may be specified. However, the number of the specific ISO
standard is often included in the metric specifications—for example, M20–2.5
DIN 934 HEX NUT. Finish need not be mentioned if the fastener or nut is
correctly named.
Nuts may be specified as follows:

Step by Step
Sketching Hex Bolts, Cap Screws, and Nuts
 Determine the diameter of the bolt, the length (from the underside of the
bearing surface to the tip), the style of head (square or hexagon), the type (regular
or heavy), and the finish before starting to draw. Lightly sketch the top view as shown, where D is the diameter of the bolt.
Project the corners of the hexagon or square to the front view. Sketch the head and
nut heights. Add the washer face if needed. Its diameter is equal to the distance
across flats of the bolt head or nut. Only the metric and finished hexagon screws
or nuts have a washer face. The washer face is 1/64′′ (0.4 mm) thick but is shown
at about 1/32′′ (1 mm) for clarity. The head or nut height includes the washer
face.
 Represent the curves produced by the chamfer on the bolt heads and nuts as
circular arcs, although they are actually hyperbolas. On drawings of small bolts ornuts under approximately 1/2′′ (12 mm) in diameter, where the chamfer is hardly
noticeable, omit the chamfer in the rectangular view.
 Chamfer the threaded end of the screw at 45° from the thread depth. Show threads in simplified or schematic form for diameters of 1′′ (25 mm)
or less on the drawing. Detailed representation is rarely used because it clutters
the drawing and takes too much time.Hex Head Bolt Grades
Hex head bolts come in a variety of SAE grades. A system of marks on the head
of the bolt indicates the grade, which is an indication of its minimum tensile
strength.
The commonly used grades are 1 or 2 which are unmarked and are low to medium
carbon steel. Grade 5 bolts provide higher minimum tensile strength. They are
marked with 3 lines on the bolt head. Grade 8 bolts provide even higher minimum
tensile strength and are marked with 6 lines.Metric grades are marked with numerals in the format X.Y indicating the various
grades, for example, 4.6 is a low carbon steel metric grade.
Bolt selection and the torques required to tighten them are based on your
particular application.
SAE grade 8 has 6 lines marked on the bolt head; SAE grade 5 has 3 lines marked on the bolt head.
13.14 Locknuts and Locking Devices
Many types of special nuts and devices to prevent nuts from unscrewing are
available, and some of the most common are shown in Figure 13.37. The
American National Standard jam nuts, as shown in Figures 13.37a and 13.37b, are
the same as the hexagon or hexagon flat nuts, except that they are thinner. The
application shown in Figure 13.37b, where the larger nut is on top and is screwed
on more tightly, is recommended. They are the same distance across flats as the
corresponding hexagon nuts (1-1/2D or 1′′). They are slightly more than 1/2D in
thickness but are drawn 1/2D for simplicity. They are available with or without
the washer face in the regular and heavy types. The tops of all are flat and
chamfered at 30°, and the finished forms have either a washer face or a chamfered
bearing surface.13.37 Locknuts and Locking Devices
The lock washer, shown in Figure 13.37c, and the cotter pin, shown in Figure
13.37e, are very common (see Appendices 24 and 27). The set screw, shown in
Figure 13.37f, is often made to press against a plug of softer material, such as
brass, which in turn presses against the threads without deforming them. With
cotter pins (see Appendix 27), it is recommended to use a hex slotted nut (Figure
13.37g), a hex castle nut (Figure 13.37h), or a hex thick slotted nut or a heavy hex
thick slotted nut.
Similar metric locknuts and locking devices are available. See fastener catalogs
for details.Hexagon Head Screws Coarse, fine, or 8-thread series, 2A.

13.15 Standard Cap Screws
Five types of American National Standard cap screws are shown in Figure 13.38.
The first four of these have standard heads, whereas the socket head cap screws,
as shown in Figure 13.38e, have several different shapes of round heads and
sockets. Cap screws are normally finished and are used on machine tools and
other machines when accuracy and appearance are important. The ranges of sizes
and exact dimensions are given in Appendices 15 and 16. The hexagon head cap
screw and hex socket head cap screw are also available in metric.13.38 Standard Cap Screws—See Appendices 15 and 16
Cap screws ordinarily pass through a clearance hole in one member and screw
into another.
Cap screws are inferior to studs when frequent removal is necessary. They are
used on machines requiring few adjustments. The slotted or socket-type heads are
used for crowded conditions.
Actual dimensions may be used in drawing cap screws when exact sizes are
necessary. Figure 13.38 shows the proportions in terms of body diameter (D) that
are usually used. Hexagonal head cap screws are drawn similar to hex head bolts.
The points are chamfered at 45° from the schematic thread depth.
Note that screwdriver slots are drawn at 45° in the circular views of the heads,
without regard to true projection, and that threads in the bottom of the tapped
holes are omitted so that the ends of the screws may be clearly seen. A typical cap

13.16 Standard Machine Screws
Machine screws are similar to cap screws but are usually smaller (.060′′ to .750′′
diameter) and the threads generally go all the way to the head. There are eight
ANSI-approved forms of heads, which are shown in Appendix 19. The hexagonal
head may be slotted if desired. All others are available in either slotted- or
recessed-head forms. Standard machine screws are produced with a naturally
bright finish, not heat treated, and have plain-sheared ends, not chamfered. For
similar metric machine screw forms and specifications, see Appendix 17.
Machine screws are used for screwing into thin materials, and the smaller￾numbered screws are threaded nearly to the head. They are used extensively in
firearms, jigs, fixtures, and dies. Machine screw nuts are used mainly on the round
head, pan head, and flat head types and are usually hexagonal.
Exact dimensions of machine screws are given in Appendix 17 tables, but they are
seldom needed for drawing purposes. The four most common types of machinescrews are shown in Figure 13.39, with proportions based on the diameter (D).
Clearance holes and counterbores should be made slightly larger than the screws.

Screw Drive Types
Slotted Easily manufactured, this common drive type is often called a flat
head screw.
Phillips Named for Henry F. Phillips, though he is not credited with
inventing it, but rather with the refined design and manufacture. This
head type is designed to be self centering and to limit overtightening.
Pozidriv Pozidriv screws are similar to Phillips but they allow you to
apply more torque than the Phillips design does. SupaDriv is a similar
style.
Hex Hex (or Allen key) heads are easy to produce and insert with low
cost hex-key tools.
M8 × 1.25 × 30 SLOTTED
PAN HEAD MACHINE SCREWHexalobular Often called torx head or star because of the 6 point star
pattern, these styles provide better contact between the driver and the
screw head to allow higher torque. TTAP is an improved design to reduce
wobble.
Security T Similar to a torx screw, but designed to be even more difficult
to remove without the proper tool.
Double-square This head style has an 8-pointed star shape. It can be
driven with a square drive, but has more positions for easier insertion of
the tool.
Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) Sometimes called Japanese Phillips,
these cross-style heads have a single depressed dot or an “X” to one side
of the cross slot to indicate that they can be overtightened with a Phillips
screwdriver.
Combinations Some screws accept more than one style of driver, such as the
slotted-Phillips. Slotted-pozidriv heads are also common in electrical products.
Many other specialty drive types are available for security, single direction
turning, limited reuse, special torque requirements, and other factors. Special
drivers are also available to allow precise torquing of screws.
13.17 Standard Set ScrewsSet screws, shown in Figure 13.40, are used to prevent motion, usually rotary,
between two parts, such as the movement of the hub of a pulley on a shaft. A set
screw is screwed into one part so that its point bears firmly against another part. If
the point of the set screw is cupped, or if a flat is milled on the shaft, the screw
will hold much more firmly. Obviously, set screws are not efficient when the load
is heavy or when it is suddenly applied. Usually they are manufactured of steel
and case hardened (Figure 13.41).
13.40 Set Screws13.41 Set Screw Proportions (Courtesy of David M. Demchenkov)
Headless set screws have come into greater use because a projecting head on a set
screw has caused many industrial casualties; this has resulted in legislation
prohibiting their use in many states.
Metric hexagon socket headless set screws with the full range of points are
available. Nominal diameters of metric hex socket set screws are 1.6, 2, 2.5, 3, 4,
5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, and 24 mm.
Square-head set screws have coarse, fine, or 8-pitch threads and are Class 2A but
are usually furnished with coarse threads, because the square-head set screw is
generally used on the rougher grades of work. Slotted headless and socket set
screws have coarse or fine threads and are Class 3A.
Nominal diameters of set screws range from number 0 up through 2′′. Set screw
lengths are standardized in increments of 1/32′′ to 1′′ depending on the overall
length of the set screw.Metric set screw length increments range from 0.5 to 4 mm, again depending on
overall screw length.
Set screws are specified as follows:

The Phillips style recessed head is also available on several types of fasteners, as
well as on wood screws. Three styles of cross recesses have been standardized by
ANSI. A special screwdriver is used, as shown in Figure 13.43q, and this results
in rapid assembly without damage to the head.
Wood Screws (anborvl/123RF.)
13.19 Miscellaneous FastenersMany other types of fasteners have been devised for specialized uses. Some of the
more common types are shown in Figure 13.43. A number of these are American
National Standard round head bolts, including carriage, button head, step, and
countersunk bolts.
13.43 Miscellaneous Bolts and Screws
Helical-coil-threaded inserts, shown in Figure 13.43p, are shaped like a spring
except that the cross section of the wire conforms to threads on the screw and in
the hole. These are made of phosphor bronze or stainless steel, and they provide a
hard, smooth protective lining for tapped threads in soft metals and plastics.
13.20 KeysKeys are used to prevent movement between shafts and wheels, couplings, cranks,
and similar machine parts attached to or supported by shafts, as shown in Figure
13.44. A keyseat is in a shaft; a keyway is in the hub or surrounding part.
13.44 Square and Flat Keys
For heavy-duty functions, rectangular keys (flat or square) are used, and
sometimes two rectangular keys are necessary for one connection. For even
stronger connections, interlocking splines may be machined on the shaft and in
the hole.
A square key is shown in Figure 13.44a.
A flat key is shown in Figure 13.44b. The widths of keys are generally about one
fourth the shaft diameter. In either case, half the key is sunk into the shaft. The
depth of the keyway or the keyseat is measured on the side—not the center—as
shown in Figure 13.44a. Square and flat keys may have the top surface tapered 
1/8′′ per foot, in which case they become square taper or flat taper keys.
A feather key is rectangular to prevent rotary motion, but permits relative
longitudinal motion. Usually, feather keys have gib heads, or are fastened so they
cannot slip out of the keyway.A gib head key (Figure 13.44c) is the same as a square taper or flat taper key
except that a gib head allows its easy removal. Square and flat keys are made
from cold-finished stock and are not machined. For dimensions, see Appendix 18.
A Pratt & Whitney key (P&W key) is shown in Figure 13.44d. It is rectangular,
with semicylindrical ends. Two-thirds of its height is sunk into the shaft keyseat
(see Appendix 22).
Woodruff keys are semicircular, as shown in Figure 13.45. This key fits into a
semicircular key slot cut with a Woodruff cutter, as shown, and the top of the key
fits into a plain rectangular keyway. Sizes of keys for given shaft diameters are
not standardized. For average conditions, select a key whose diameter is
approximately equal to the shaft diameter. For dimensions, see Appendix 21. See
manufacturers’ catalogs for specifications for metric counterparts.
13.45 Woodruff Keys and Key-Slot Cutter
Typical specifications for keys are13.21 Machine Pins
Machine pins include taper pins, straight pins, dowel pins, clevis pins, and cotter
pins. For light work, taper pins can be used to fasten hubs or collars to shafts.
Figure 13.46 shows the use of a taper pin where the hole through the collar and
shaft is drilled and reamed when the parts are assembled. For slightly heavier
duty, a taper pin may be used parallel to the shaft, as for square keys (see
Appendix 26).
13.46 Taper Pin
Dowel pins are cylindrical or conical and usually used to keep two parts in a fixed
position or to preserve alignment. They are usually used where accurate alignment
is essential. Dowel pins are generally made of steel and are hardened and ground
in a centerless grinder.
Clevis pins are used in a clevis and held in place by cotter pins. For the latter, see
Appendix 27.

2 FLATKEY13.22 Rivets
Rivets are regarded as permanent fastenings, unlike removable fastenings, such as
bolts and screws. Rivets are generally used to hold sheet metal or rolled steel
together and are made of wrought iron, carbon steel, copper, or occasionally other
metals.
To fasten two pieces of metal together, holes are punched, drilled, or punched and
then reamed, all slightly larger in diameter than the shank of the rivet. Rivet
diameters are made from d = 1.2√t to d = 1.4√t, where d is the rivet diameter
and t is the metal thickness. The larger rivet diameter size is used for steel and
single-riveted joints, and the smaller may be used for multiple-riveted joints. In
structural work it is common to make the hole 1.6 mm (1/16′′) larger than the
rivet.
When the red-hot rivet is inserted, a “dolly bar” with a depression the shape of the
driven head is held against the head. A riveting machine is used to drive the rivet
and forms the head on the plain end. This causes the rivet to swell and fill the hole
tightly.
Large rivets or heavy hex structural bolts are often used in structural work for
bridges and buildings and in ship and boiler construction. They are shown in
Figure 13.47 in their exact formula proportions. Button heads (Figure 13.47a) and
countersunk heads (Figure 13.47e) are the rivets most commonly used in
structural work. The button head and cone head are commonly used in tank and
boiler construction.13.47 Standard Large Rivets
Riveted Joints
Typical riveted joints are shown in Figure 13.48. Note that the rectangular view of
each rivet shows the shank of the rivet with both heads made with circular arcs,
and the circular view of each rivet is represented by only the outside circle of the
head.
13.48 Common Riveted Joints
Rivet Symbols
Because many engineering structures are too large to be built in the shop, they are
built in the largest units possible and then are transported to the desired location.
Trusses are common examples.The rivets driven in the shop are called shop rivets, and those driven on the job are
called field rivets. However, heavy steel bolts are commonly used on the job for
structural work. Solid black circles are used to represent field rivets, and other
standard symbols are used to show other features, as shown in Figure 13.49.
13.49 Conventional Rivet Symbols
Small Rivets
Small rivets are used for light work. American National Standard small solid
rivets are illustrated with dimensions that show their standard proportions in
Figure 13.50, from ANSI/ASME B18.1.1. Included in the same standard are
tinners’, coppers’, and belt rivets. Metric rivets are also available. Dimensions for
large rivets are in ANSI/ASME B18.1.2. See manufacturers’ catalogs for additional
details.13.50 American National Standard Small Solid Rivet Proportions
Blind Rivets
Blind rivets, commonly known as pop rivets (Figure 13.51), are often used for
fastening together thin sheet-metal assemblies. Blind rivets are hollow and are
installed with manual or power-operated rivet guns that grip a center pin or
mandrel, pulling the head into the body and expanding the rivet against the sheet
metal. They are available in aluminum, steel, stainless steel, and plastic. As with
any fastener, it is important to choose an appropriate material to avoid corrosive
action between dissimilar metals.
13.51 Blind Rivets (a) Before Installation and (b) Installed
13.23 SpringsA spring is a mechanical device designed to store energy when deflected and to
return the equivalent amount of energy when released (see ANSI Y14.13M).
Springs are commonly made of spring steel, which may be music wire, hard￾drawn wire, or oil-tempered wire. Other materials used for compression springs
include stainless steel, beryllium copper, and phosphor bronze. Urethane plastic is
used in applications where conventional springs would be affected by corrosion,
vibration, or acoustic or magnetic forces.
Springs are classified as helical springs (Figure 13.52), or flat springs.
13.52 Helical Springs
Helical Springs
Helical springs are usually cylindrical but may also be conical. There are three
types of helical springs:Compression springs offer resistance to a compressive force.
Extension springs offer resistance to a pulling force.
Torsion springs offer resistance to a torque or twisting force.
On working drawings, true projections of helical springs are not drawn because of
the labor involved. Like screw threads, they are drawn in detailed and schematic
methods, using straight lines to replace helical curves, as shown in Figure 13.52.
A square wire spring is similar to the square thread with the core of the shaft
removed, as in Figure 13.52b. Use standard cross-hatching if the areas in section
are large, as in Figures 13.52a and b. Small sectioned areas may be made solid
black, as in Figure 13.52c.
In cases where a complete picture of the spring is not necessary, use phantom
lines to save time in drawing the coils, as in Figure 13.52d. If the drawing of the
spring is too small to be represented by the outlines of the wire, use schematic
representation, shown in Figures 13.52e and f.
Compression springs have plain ends, as in Figure 13.53a, or squared (closed)
ends, as in Figure 13.53b. The ends may be ground, as shown in Figure 13.53c, or
both squared and ground, as in Figure 13.53d. Required dimensions are indicated
in the figure. When required, RH or LH is specified for right-hand or left-hand
coil direction.13.53 Compression Springs
Springs (Norton, Robert L., Machine Design: An Integrated Approach, 3rd, © 2006. Printed and electronically reproduced by permission
of Pearson Education, Upper Saddle River, NJ.)
Extension springs may have many types of ends, so it is necessary to draw the
spring or at least the ends and a few adjacent coils, as shown in Figure 13.54.13.54 Extension Spring Drawing
A typical torsion spring drawing is shown in Figure 13.55. A typical flat spring
drawing is shown in Figure 13.56. Other types of flat springs are power springs
(or flat coil springs), Belleville springs (like spring washers), and leaf springs
(commonly used in automobiles).
13.55 Torsion Spring Drawing13.56 Flat Spring Drawing
Many companies use a printed specification form to provide the necessary spring
information, including data such as load at a specified deflected length, load rate,
finish, and type of service.
13.24 Drawing Helical Springs
The construction for a schematic elevation view of a compression spring with six
total coils is shown in Figure 13.57a. Because the ends are closed, or squared, two
of the six coils are “dead” coils, leaving only four full pitches to be set off along
the top of the spring.13.57 Schematic Spring Representation
If there are six and a half total coils, as shown in Figure 13.57b, the P/2
measurement is set on opposite sides of the spring. The construction of an
extension spring with six active coils and loop ends is shown in Figure 13.57c.
Figure 13.58 shows the steps in drawing a detailed section and elevation view of a
compression spring. The spring is shown pictorially in Figure 13.58a. Figure
13.58b shows the cutting plane through the centerline of the spring. Figure 13.58c
shows the section with the cutting plane removed. Steps to construct the sectional
view are shown in Figures 13.58d–f. Figure 13.58g shows the corresponding
elevation view.13.58 Steps in Detailed Representation of Spring
If there are a fractional number of coils, such as the 5.5 coils in Figure 13.58h, the
half-rounds of sectional wire are placed on opposite sides of the spring.
13.25 Modeling Springs
Using 3D modeling, it is uncommon to model springs accurately, unless it is
important to show them in the assembly. Springs are usually stock parts that are
specified and purchased rather than designed individually. If you must show
springs, they may sometimes be modeled as a single 3D curve, as shown in Figure
13.59. Because of their shape, springs are complex objects that greatly increase
the file size of your models. You should model them accurately only when there is
a design or production benefit to be gained from doing so.13.59 Springs are sometimes represented as a single 3D curve in a 3D model when the complexity of the
shape outweighs the benefits of modeling it.

Downloading Standard Fasteners
Many stock fasteners are available to download in standard CAD formats ready to
use in CAD drawings and models. For example, the PennEngineering company
makes files available for the many PEM brand fasteners used to fasten sheet metal
parts, such as the part shown in Figure B, on their site at www.pemnet.com.
The CAD files that you download can be inserted into your drawings to save
drawing time. The stock fastener type is specified in a drawing note as shown in
Figure B.
Data sheets in PDF format are also available from the PEM site. Figure C shows
the cover of a 6-page PDF booklet that lists material, thread size, performance
data, and other key data for unified and metric self-clinching flush nuts sold by

Worksheet 46
Chapter SummaryThere are many types of thread forms; however, metric and unified are the
most common.
The method of showing threads on a drawing is called the thread
representation. The three types of thread representation are detailed, schematic,
and simplified.
The major diameter, pitch, and form are the most important parts of a thread
specification.
Thread specifications are dimensioned using a leader, usually pointing to the
rectangular view of the threaded shaft or to the circular view of a threaded
hole. The thread specification tells the manufacturing technician what kind of
thread needs to be created.
The nut and bolt is still the most common type of fastener. Many new types of
fasteners are being created to streamline the production process.
Keys and pins are special fasteners for attachment; for example, attaching a
pulley to a shaft.
The screw head determines what kind of tool will be necessary to install the
fastener.

electrical components shown. Use the Web to research power and electrical
connectors.
Exercise 13.6 Captive hardware is a term for fasteners that, once installed, cannot
be easily or accidentally removed. This is typically achieved by removing a
portion of the threading on a screw shaft and then threading the captive hardware
into a special sleeve that, once installed, prevents the hardware from backing out.
Captive hardware is useful in situations where many fasteners are necessary—forexample in sheet metal covers and large panels and when the fastener must be
repeatedly unfastened and refastened.
For this exercise, modify a standard 6 − 32 × .75′′ socket head cap screw
(SHCS) so it can be installed into a sleeve that you will design. The dimensions
for the lock and flat washer are provided on the facing page, and the dimensions
from the screw to be modified are provided from a CAD file downloaded from the
McMaster-Carr website. Provide dimensions for turning down the thread on the
6–32 SHCS and the missing callouts on the captive screw sleeve. Ensure the
dimensions provided for the threaded portion of the screw and the clearance for
the captive screw sleeve allow the screw to be fully inserted and allow it to be
completely removed from the threaded blank material without causing
interference.Chapter Fourteen

Overview
Design professionals such as engineers and architects are creators or
builders. They use graphics as a means to create, record, analyze, and
communicate their design concepts or ideas so that they can be realized or
made into products or structures. The ability to communicate verbally,
symbolically, and graphically is essential to building the teams necessary to
create large scale projects.
Different types of drawings are required at each stage of the design process.
Early in the process, ideation sketches communicate and refine concepts for
the project. Later, detailed layouts, analysis, and part drawings are createdusing 2D CAD or solid modeling techniques. Assembly drawings created in
3D CAD or using 2D methods show how multiple parts fit together. They
describe the end result—how the individual pieces that must fit together to
work.
Releasing and revising drawings is an important part of the design process.
Revisions must be tracked, identified, logged, and saved for future
reference. Understanding and using effective methods to manage paper and
electronic documents is crucial for retaining important information and
preventing costly and even dangerous mistakes.
Working Drawings or Construction Drawings
The term working drawings describes a set of assembly drawings and
detail drawings. A set of civil drawings with site, grading plans, and the
many structural details for building a dam or bridge is an example of a set
of working drawings.
Architectural drawings are another type of working (or construction)
drawings (Figure 14.1). They are given to the contractor to show how to
construct the building envisioned by the architect. Working drawings for
machines include assembly drawings showing how parts fit together and
detail drawings showing how to manufacture the parts. Weldments are a
type of assembly drawing showing the welds that must be used to form an
assembly from separate pieces of metal.14.1 Portion of a Mechanical System for a Building (Courtesy of Associated Construction Engineering, Inc.)
Drawings, models, and supporting documentation are the specifications for
design manufacture. They are given to contractors to perform the work or
manufacture individual parts, so they must represent the design accurately.
The drawing is a legal document describing what work is to be performed
or what parts are to be produced.
A careful process of checking and approving drawings and models helps
prevent errors. Take preparing or approving drawings as a serious
responsibility. Overlooking what may seem to be small or insignificantdetails may result in large amounts of wasted money or, worse, a person’s
injury or death.
Assembly Drawings
An assembly drawing shows the assembled machine or structure, with all
detail parts in their functional positions or as an exploded view where you
can relate the parts to their functional positions.
There are different types of assembly drawings:
1. Design assemblies, or layouts.
2. General assemblies.
3. Detail assemblies.
4. Working drawing assemblies.
5. Outline or installation assemblies.
6. Inseparable assemblies (as in weldments, and others).
Assembly drawings are often generated from 3D CAD models. For
example, the assembly drawing for the air brake in Figure 14.2 was
generated from the 3D CAD model of the air brake shown in a shaded view
in Figure 14.3.14.2 General Assembly Drawing for an Air Brake Created from a 3D CAD Model (Courtesy of Dynojet
Research, Inc.)14.3 3D CAD Model for an Air Brake (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)
Views
Keep the purpose in mind when you select the views for an assembly
drawing. The assembly drawing shows how the parts fit together andsuggests the function of the entire unit. A complete set of orthographic
views is not required. Often a single orthographic view will show all of the
information needed when assembling the parts. The assembly drawing does
not need to show how to make the parts, just how to put them together. The
assembly worker receives the actual finished parts. The information for
each individual part is shown on its detail drawing.
Hidden Lines in Assembly Drawings
Typically, hidden lines are not needed on assembly drawings. Keep in mind
that the assembly drawing is often used by the worker who is putting the
parts together. It needs to be easy to read and show the relationships
between parts clearly. Hidden lines can make the drawing difficult to read,
so use section or exploded views to show the interior parts in the assembly
drawing.
Dimensions in Assembly Drawings
Assembly drawings are not usually dimensioned except to show the relative
positions of one feature to the next when that distance must be maintained
at the time of the assembly, such as the maximum height of a jack, or the
maximum opening between the jaws of a vise. When machining is required
in the assembly operation, the necessary dimensions and notes may be
given on the assembly drawing.
Assembly SectionsBecause assemblies often have parts fitting into or overlapping other parts,
2D and 3D sections are useful views. For example, in Figure 14.4, try to
imagine the right-side view drawn in elevation with interior parts
represented by hidden lines.
14.4 Assembly Drawing of a Grinder
Any kind of section may be used as needed. A broken-out section is shown
in Figure 14.4. Half sections and removed sections are also frequently used.
Pictorial sections are helpful in creating easy-to-read assembly drawings.
Detail Drawings or Piece Part DrawingsDrawings of the individual parts are called piece part drawings, part
drawings, or detail drawings. Detail drawings contain all of the necessary
information to manufacture any specific part being created for a product or
design. Figures 14.5 and 14.6 show detail drawings. The information
provided on detail drawings includes:

All necessary drawing views or accurate 3D model information to fully
define the shape.
Dimensions that can be specified in a drawing or can be measured
accurately from a 3D model.
Tolerances either specified in a drawing or annotated in a 3D model so
that how the tolerance applies can be clearly understood.
The material for the manufactured part.
Any general or specific notes including heat treatment, painting,
coatings, hardness, pattern number, estimated weight, and surface
finishes, such as maximum surface roughness.Approval or release and revision tracking, whether part of a 2D drawing
title and revision block or part of a digital signature system.
14.1 Subassemblies
A set of working drawings includes detail drawings of individual parts and
the assembly drawing showing the assembled unit. Often, an entire
subassembly may be reused in a different design. It is easier to reuse the
group of parts in a new design if they are grouped together logically and
contained in separate drawings. Your top-level assembly drawing will
appear cleaner if you keep subassemblies well organized, as the entire
subassembly can be identified as a single item on a higher-level assembly
drawing. Fasteners for the subassembly that attach it to its mating parts in
the next higher level assembly drawing are usually shown or listed on the
bill of materials (sometimes referred to as BOM) at the higher level.
Structuring a product into assemblies and subassemblies requires thoughtful
decision making to facilitate retrieving part, subassembly, and assembly
drawings later on. If your company uses a product data management system
(PDM), planning is essential to seeing downstream results.
An example of a subassembly is shown in Figure 14.7. A subassembly is
drawn the same way as an assembly drawing, just for a subgroup that
assembles to other parts.14.7 Subassembly of Accessory Shaft Group
14.2 Identification
Circled numbers called balloon numbers or ball tags are used to identify
the parts in the assembly (Figure 14.8). Circles containing the part numbers
are placed adjacent to the parts, with leaders terminated by arrowheads
touching the parts as shown in Figure 14.9.
14.8 Identification Numbers14.9 Identification of Assembly Drawing Items with a Parts List (Courtesy of Big Sky Laser.)
Place the circles in orderly horizontal or vertical rows and not scattered
over the sheet. Draw leader lines at an angle, not horizontally or vertically.
Do not let leaders cross. Make adjacent leaders parallel or nearly so. For
multiple small parts that are easily distinguished, a single leader may have
multiple circle item numbers as shown in Figure 14.9.
The circled item number identifies each part. Show information for the part
in the parts list. The parts list is usually included on the drawing sheet but
may also be a separate document.Another method of identification is to letter the part names, quantity
required, and part numbers at the end of leaders, as shown in Figure 14.7.
More commonly, only the part numbers are given, together with standard
straight-line leaders.
Multidetail Drawings
When multiple detail drawings are shown on one sheet, label each part with
identification similar to that used on any detail drawings. A portion of a
multidetail drawing is shown in Figure 14.10. It is highly preferred to show
only one part per sheet. This provides a unique drawing number for each
part, which is very important for retrieving information from a PDM
system. Often the part number is used as the drawing number.
14.10 Portion of a Drawing Showing Identification of Details with a Parts List
14.3 Parts ListsA parts list or bill of materials (BOM) itemizes the parts of a structure
shown on an assembly drawing (ANSI Y14.34). The title strip alone is
sufficient on detail drawings of only one part, but a parts list is necessary on
assembly drawings or detail drawings of several parts. Parts can be listed in
general order of size or importance or grouped by types.
Parts lists for machine drawings (Figure 14.11) contain:
14.11 Parts List (Courtesy of Big Sky Laser.)
Part identification number (PIN).
Description of each part.
Quantity required in the assembly.
The following abbreviations can be used to indicate quantities that are not
exactly known: AR indicates as required; EST followed by a number
specifies an estimated quantity.
Parts lists that contain application data must include information for the
next assembly level.Frequently, other information is supplied in the parts list, such as material,
DAI code, pattern numbers, stock sizes, and weights of parts.
Automatic BOM Generation
CAD software often allows you to generate the parts list automatically or
somewhat automatically. Some CAD software uses the terminology Parts
List, others BOM, and some use both terms but have different command
features based on which is selected (they will be considered interchangeable
here). Figure 14.12 shows a dialog box used to automate generation of a
parts list.14.12 SolidWorks Dialog Box Showing Options for Automatically Inserting a Bill of Materials
Table (Image courtesy of ©2016 Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks Corporation.)
If you created a 3D assembly model by inserting CAD models for the parts,
the software can query the assembly model for quantities and the file namesthat were inserted to generate the parts list. This is another good reason to
use good file management practices and name your parts logically. Most
software allows you to type in information, but overriding the information
this way makes it harder to automatically update files, losing some of the
advantage of using 3D CAD.
Locating the Parts List
If the parts list rests on top of the title box or strip, the order of the items
should be from the bottom upward so that new items can be added later, if
necessary. If the parts list is placed in the upper-right corner, the items
should read downward.
Listing Standard Parts
Standard parts, whether purchased or company produced, are not drawn but
are included in the parts list. Bolts, screws, bearings, pins, keys, and so on
are identified by the part number from the assembly drawing and are
specified by name and size or number.
14.4 Assembly Sections
In assembly sections it is necessary not only to show the cut surfaces but
also to distinguish between adjacent parts. Do this by drawing the section
lines in opposing directions, as shown in Figure 14.13. The first large area
is sectioned at 45° (Figure 14.13a). The next large area is sectioned at 45°in the opposite direction. Additional areas are then sectioned at other
angles, such as 30° or 60°, as shown in Figure 14.13c, or at other angles.
14.13 Section Lining in Assemblies (Full Size)
In small areas it is necessary to space the section lines closer together. In
larger areas, space section lining more widely or use outline section lining.
Use the general-purpose section lining for assemblies. You can also give a
general indication of the materials used by using symbolic section lining
(Figure 14.14). Refer to Chapter 8 to review section drawing practices.14.14 Symbolic Section Lining
In sectioning relatively thin parts in an assembly, such as gaskets and sheet
metal parts, section lining is ineffective and should be left out or shown in
solid black, as in Figure 14.15.
14.15 Solidly Hatching Small Parts
In architectural drawings, filling sectioned areas solidly is called poche, as
shown in Figure 14.16. It is often used to show walls that have been cut
through, as on floor plans.14.16 Architectural Drawing Detail. Use hatch patterns to indicate material and poche small
features. (Courtesy of Locati Architects.)
Often solid objects, or parts that do not show required information, are
sliced by the cutting plane. Leave these parts unsectioned, or “in the round.”
This includes bolts, nuts, shafts, keys, screws, pins, ball or roller bearings,
gear teeth, spokes, and ribs, among others. See Figure 14.17.14.17 Assembly Section
You can save time in creating assemblies by downloading models of stock parts from vendors online.
Sites such as TraceParts.com make it easy to locate stock parts from many different manufacturers.
(Courtesy of TraceParts.com.)14.5 Working Drawing Assembly
A working drawing assembly is a combined detail and assembly drawing
(Figure 14.18). These drawings are often used in place of separate detail
and assembly drawings when the assembly is simple enough for all of its
parts to be shown clearly in the single drawing. In some cases, all but one or
two parts can be drawn and dimensioned clearly in the assembly drawing,
in which event these parts are detailed separately on the same sheet. This
type of drawing is common in valve drawings, locomotive subassemblies,
aircraft subassemblies, and drawings of jigs and fixtures.
14.18 Working Drawing Assembly of Drill JigAutodesk Inventor is an example of a software package that features stock parts useful for creating
assemblies. (Autodesk screen shots reprinted courtesy of Autodesk, Inc.)
14.6 Installation Assemblies
An assembly made specifically to show how to install or erect a machine or
structure is an installation assembly. This type of drawing is also often
called an outline assembly, because it shows only the outlines and the
relationships of exterior surfaces. A typical installation assembly is shown
in Figure 14.19. In aircraft drafting, an installation drawing (assembly)
gives complete information for placing details or subassemblies in their
final positions in the airplane.14.19 Installation Assembly
14.7 Check Assemblies
After all detail drawings of a unit have been made, it may be necessary to
make a check assembly, especially if a number of changes were made in the
details. Such an assembly is shown accurately to scale to graphically check
the correctness of the details and their relationship in assembly. After the
check assembly has served its purpose, it may be converted into a general
assembly drawing.
14.8 Working Drawing Formats
Number of Details Per SheetThere are two general methods for grouping detailed parts on sheets.
Showing one detailed part per sheet is typically preferred because it is
easier to repurpose drawings for other uses and to track revision data when
the sheet does not contain extra parts.
Small machines or structures composed of few parts sometimes show all the
details on one large sheet. Showing the assembly and all its details on one
sheet can be convenient, but it is generally more difficult to revise and
maintain. The same scale should be used for all details on a single sheet, if
possible. When this is not possible, clearly note the scale under each
dissimilar detail.
Most companies show one detail per sheet, however simple or small it may
be. For many parts the basic 8.5′′ × 11′′ or 210mm × 297mm sheet works
well. Because it is easy to lose a few drawings on smaller sheets from a set
that is mostly on larger sheets, some companies use 11′′ × 17′′ (or the
equivalent metric size) sheets for all parts.
Digital Drawing Transmittal
Electronic file formats such as Portable Document Format (PDF), originally
developed by Adobe Systems in 1993, allow the originator to send a
document that can be commented on without allowing the original
document to be changed.Several search engines allow you to search for text embedded in the PDF
file. This means that PDF can provide advantages not just for storing, but
also for retrieving the information later. Adobe Systems provides a useful
document (in PDF format) on using PDF as an archiving standard. Dassault
Systèmes’ eDrawings Viewer is a popular format for viewing, printing, and
marking up drawings produced in SolidWorks and AutoCAD. It runs on
Windows, Mac OS, and mobile platforms and does not require the user to
have any CAD software installed.
Using electronic files saves trees, makes it quicker to distribute and store
documents, and allows others to review documents from various
applications. Figure 14.20 shows a drawing stored in PDF format with
comments and redlined markups.14.20 A Portion of a PDF File Showing Redlined Markups (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)
Paper Conservation
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported that in 2018 the
U.S. paper and paperboard industry generated over 67 million tons of
product. About 25% of this ended up in landfills. Although paper and
paperboard products were among the largest contributors to municipal solid
waste at about 23% (with food at 21%) of the total weight, this volume is
down from the EPA estimate of paper at 38% just a few years ago. The
really good news is that the largest component of municipal waste beingrecycled is paper—at nearly 67%. Since 2020, Covid masks and PPEs have
increased the amount of paper used even though recycling has improved.
Deforestation is still a looming problem as trees are cleared to make way
for agriculture and housing developments.

(Copyright Mykola Mazuryk/Shutterstock.)Title and Record Strips
Drawings constitute important and valuable information regarding products,
so carefully designed, well-kept, systematic files are important.
The function of the title and record strip is to show, in an organized way, all
necessary information not given directly on the drawing with its dimensions
and notes. The type of title block or strip used depends on the filing system
in use, the manufacturing processes, and the requirements of the product.
The following should generally be given in the title form:
1. Name and address of the company originating the design.
2. Drawing title.
3. Drawing number.
4. Revision.
5. Approval sign offs for the Drafter, Checker, Engineer and the dates of
approval.
6. Drawing scale. Use “NONE” when no scale is used. Sheets in a set may
be to different scales.
7. Sheet size.
8. Sheet number. Such as 1 of 8, if the drawing has multiple sheets.
Other information may be included, such as material, quantity, heat
treatment, finish, hardness, pattern number, estimated weight, superseding
and superseded drawing numbers, symbol of machine, and so on, dependingon the plant organization and unique aspects of the product. Some typical
title blocks are shown in Figures 14.21, 14.22, and 14.23.
14.21 Title Strip
14.22 Title Block with Parts List (Courtesy of Dynojet Research, Inc.)
14.23 Title Block (Courtesy of Quantel USA.)
The title form is usually placed along the bottom of the sheet or in the lower
right-hand corner of the sheet, because drawings are often filed in flat,
horizontal drawers, and the title must be easily found. However, as many
filing systems are in use, the location of the title form depends on acompany’s organizational preference. Many companies adopt their own title
forms or those preferred by ANSI.
To letter items in a title form:
Use a font such as Arial that provides easy to read Gothic capitals.
Letter items according to their relative importance. Use heavier, larger or
more widely spaced type (or a combination of these) to indicate
important items.
Give the drawing number the most emphasis, followed by the name of
the object and name of the company. (Date, scale, and originator’s and
checker’s names are important, but do not need to be prominent.)
Refer to Chapter 2 for detailed information on title forms and standard
letter heights.
14.9 Drawing Numbers
Every drawing should be numbered. Some companies use numbers, such as
19530056, or a number with a prefix or suffix letter, such as A60412 or
60412-A. The drawing number is usually the same as the product
identification number (PIN). To make information retrieval easy, these
identification number cannot have spaces. Letters that can be mistaken for
numbers, such as I, O, Q, S, X, and Z, are not used.
In different numbering schemes, various parts of the drawing number
indicate different things, such as model number of the machine and thenature or use of the part. In general, it is best to use a simple numbering
system and not to load the number with too many indications.
The drawing number should be lettered 7mm (. 2500 ′′) high in the lower￾right and upper-left corners of the sheet.
To benefit from a CAD system, you must be able to store and retrieve your
drawings efficiently. Drawing tracking software allows users to search by
part number or by text items to locate and retrieve drawing files and CAD
models.
14.10 Zoning
To help people locate a particular item on a large or complex drawing,
regular ruled intervals are labeled along the margins, often in the right and
lower margins only. The intervals on the horizontal margin are labeled from
right to left with numerals, and the intervals on the vertical margin are
labeled from bottom to top with letters, similar to road maps. Note the zone
letters and numbers around the border of Figure 14.24.14.24 Symbols match the item in the revision block to revised features on a drawing. (Courtesy of Big
Sky Laser, Inc.)
14.11 Checking Drawings
The importance of accuracy in technical drawing cannot be overstated.
Errors sometimes cause tremendous unnecessary expenditures. The
signature on the drawing identifies who is responsible for its accuracy.
In small offices, checking is usually done by the designer or by one of the
drafters. In large offices, experienced engineers may be employed to devote
a major part of their time to checking drawings.A drawing is carefully checked and signed by the person who made it. It is
then checked by the lead designer for function, economy, practicability, fit,
tolerances, and so on. Corrections, if any, are then made by the original
drafter.
The final checker should systematically review the drawing for any
remaining errors. They should study the drawing with particular attention
to:
1. Soundness of design, with reference to function, strength, materials,
economy, manufacturability, serviceability, ease of assembly and repair,
lubrication, and so on.
2. Choice of views, partial views, auxiliary views, sections, lettering, and
so on.
3. Dimensions, with special reference to repetition, ambiguity, legibility,
omissions, errors, and finish marks. Special attention should be given to
tolerances.
4. Standard parts. In the interest of economy, as many parts as possible
should be standard.
5. Notes, with special reference to clear wording and legibility.
6. Clearances. Moving parts should be checked in all possible positions to
ensure freedom of movement.
7. Title form information.
14.12 Drawing RevisionsDesign changes, error correction, and customer input may require drawing
changes. An accurate record of all changes made to released drawings is
tracked via a revision block. This is important so that the sources of all
changes may be understood, verified, and approved.
The record of revisions should show the change, by whom, when, and why
the change was made. An engineering change order (ECO) or engineering
change request (ECR) is processed to approve and track changes to
drawings once they have been released for production.
Any changes or additions made to a drawing are tracked by a revision
number. A symbol can be added to the drawing showing the item affected
by the revision (Figure 14.24).
It is not recommended to remove information by crossing it out. In rare
cases when a dimension is not noticeably affected by a change, it may be
underlined with a heavy line to indicate that it is not to scale.
It is important to keep permanent CAD files, prints, or microfilms of each
issue to show how the drawing appeared before the revision. Issue new
prints each time a change is made. If the revision history block on the actual
drawing becomes too cumbersome, the older items can be removed, leaving
only the three most recent. The information for the previous revisions must
still be stored as part of the permanent record.Digital systems absolutely must use careful backup procedures and, due to
data loss concerns, are still not approved in some industries.
If considerable change on a drawing is necessary, it may be necessary to
make a new drawing and stamp the old one OBSOLETE and store it in an
“obsolete” file. In the title block of the old drawing, enter the words
“SUPERSEDED BY” or “REPLACED BY” followed by the number of the
new drawing. On the new drawing, under “SUPERSEDES” or
“REPLACES,” enter the number of the old drawing.
People use various methods to link the area on a drawing where the change
is made to the entry in the revision block. The most common is to place
numbers or letters in a small circle or triangle near each place where the
changes were made and to use the same numbers or letters in the revision
block, as shown in Figure 14.24. On zoned drawings, the zone of the
correction is shown in the revision block. The change should also be
described briefly, along with the date and initials of the person making the
change.
14.13 Simplifying Drawings
Drawing time is a considerable part of the total cost of a product. It makes
sense to reduce drawing costs by using practices to simplify your drawings
without losing clarity. For example, use partial views, half views, thread
symbols, piping symbols, and single-line spring drawings when appropriate.Omit lines or lettering on a drawing that are not needed for clarity. In
addition to saving production time, this makes drawings easier to read. To
simplify drawings:
1. Use word descriptions when practical.
2. Do not show unnecessary views.
3. Use standard symbols such as ∅ and standard abbreviations when
appropriate.
4. Avoid elaborate, pictorial, or repetitive details. Use phantom lines to
avoid drawing repeated features.
5. List rather than draw standard parts such as bolts, nuts, keys, and pins.
6. Omit unnecessary hidden lines.
7. Use outline section lining in large areas to save time and improve
legibility.
8. Omit unnecessary duplication of notes and lettering.
9. Use symbolic representation for piping and thread.
10. Use CAD libraries and standard parts when feasible for design and
drawings.
Some industries have simplified their drafting practices even more. Learn
the practices appropriate to the industry for which you are creating
drawings.
14.14 Patent DrawingsThe patent application for a machine or device must include drawings to
illustrate and explain the invention. All patent drawings must be
mechanically correct and constitute complete illustrations of every feature
of the invention claimed. The strict requirements of the U.S. Patent Office
facilitate the examination of applications and the interpretation of patents
issued. Examples of patent drawings are shown in Figure 14.25.
14.25 Patent Drawing Examples. Although two examples are shown here, each drawing is shown on
a separate sheet in the patent application. (Courtesy of US. Patent and Trademark Office.)
Drawings for patent applications are pictorial and explanatory in nature;
therefore they are not as detailed as working drawings for production
purposes. Centerlines, hidden lines, dimension notes, and so forth, are
omitted, since specific dimensions, tolerances, and notes are often not
required to patent the general design or innovation.
The drawings must contain as many figures as necessary to show the
invention clearly. There is no limit on the number of sheets that may besubmitted. The drawings can be produced by hand or from the same CAD
database used to create the design documentation.
Figures should be numbered consecutively (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure
3A, Figure 3B, etc.). Views, features, and parts are identified by numbers
that refer to the descriptions and explanations given in the specification
section of the patent application. The reference number for a part or feature
should remain the same in every diagram.
Exploded isometric or perspective drawings with reference numbers
identifying the parts (i.e., assembly drawings) are preferred. Centerlines are
used to illustrate how parts are aligned in exploded views. While the
drawing must show every feature that is listed in the patent claims, if
standardized parts are used, they can be represented symbolically and do
not have to be drawn in detail.
The figures may be plan, elevation, section, pictorial, and detail views of
portions or elements, and they may be drawn to an enlarged scale if
necessary.
The U.S. Patent Office has basic standards for drawings:
All sheets within a single application must be the same size, and two
sheet sizes are accepted:
U.S. size: 8.5′′ by 11 ′′( 216mm × 279mm).
International size: 210mm × 297mm.Paper must be single sided.
Paper must be oriented vertically, so that the short side of the sheet is at
the top (called portrait style in printing options).
No border lines are permitted on the sheets.
The following minimum margins must be maintained:
Top margin: 1′′(25mm).
Left margin: 1′′(25mm).
Right margin: .675′′(15mm).
Bottom margin: .375′′(10mm).
No labels or drawing lines may extend into the margin except for the
specific identification required at the top of each sheet and two scan
target points.
All drawings must be submitted in black and white—no color drawings
or photos except in very limited cases.
Lines must be solid black and suitable for reproduction at a smaller size.
Shading (either cross hatch or stippling) is used whenever it improves
readability. In rare cases when it is necessary to show a feature hidden
behind a surface, a lighter solid line is used.
Sketches are acceptable for the application process, but formal drawings
will have to be created if accepted.
Photocopies are accepted, because three copies of each drawing must be
submitted. The drawings will not be returned so it is not a good idea to send
an original with the initial patent application. Drawings may also be
submitted via the electronic filing system.While the above gives you a basic idea of the standards for patent drawings,
the strict requirements of the U.S. Patent Office are carefully documented
on their website. Be sure to follow their requirements exactly if you are
preparing drawings for a patent application.

Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.
Industry Case
Convey the Essence of the Design
Ryan Cargo graduated from Montana State University in 2005 with a B.S.
in Mechanical Engineering and soon was hired by a NASA contractor to
work on aircraft and satellite-based earth-science research systems, where
he helped build the camera shutters for the James Webb Space Telescope.
After a move to bike-friendly Berlin, Germany, he helped design a new
high-speed FDM (fused deposition modeling) print head at a large-format
3D printing startup. Ryan’s passion for bicycle touring and the sight of
thousands of bicycles on the streets of Berlin sparked his interest in
designing a new type of bike frame.Ryan wanted to get away from the typical triangle tube frame construction.
He pictured the axles, handlebars, seat, and cranks all hanging in free space
and began imagining all the ways to connect those components with more
interesting materials. Taking measurements from his road bike, Ryan drew
the locations of all the key points to scale on paper. Using tracing paper
over this “location template,” Ryan sketched all sorts of novel shapes until
an idea emerged for a structure with gently curving surfaces that could
easily be made from laminated plywood reinforced with composites.
From the hand sketches, Ryan cut full-size plywood shapes and fixed them
at the key points where the axle, head tube, seat tube, and bottom bracket
would attach, otherwise letting the plywood take on its natural and
aesthetically pleasing bend. Using calipers to get X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates
of the resulting surface, he created a surface model using Rhinoceros 3D
CAD software, then used SolidWorks to add critical interfaces, such as
bores for bearings, recesses for chain clearance and brake calibers, and the
internal passages for cable and hydraulic lines. Ryan used the model to 3D
print full-scale molds for laying up the carbon fiber and wood veneers of
the real bike frame.
Thinking of turning his bike-building hobby into a business, Ryan decided
to protect the design by getting a patent. He was curious about the patent
process anyway. “I’m used to focusing on every detail on engineering
drawings—a clear dimensioning strategy, tolerances that ensure the real part
works, making every detail about material and coatings clear, and so on. Ifound patent drawings (especially for this design patent) to be a refreshing
break from this, allowing me some flexibility to be artistic and to convey
the essence of how the design feels, ” said Ryan.
The patent office drawing requirements state, “One of the views should be
suitable for inclusion on the front page of the patent application publication
and patent as the illustration of the invention.” Ryan chose a front-right
isometric view of the bike frame for this, with the frame itself stippled and
major components (such as the wheels and handlebars) shown as faint,
dashed lines, to convey that the design is for a bicycle that anyone could
ride but with a very novel frame (Figure 14.27). Ryan submitted his patent
drawings electronically as high-resolution images embedded in Microsoft
Word files. From start to finish, the patent process took about 18 months.
Ryan was granted the patent in 2018. You can see more about his unique
design at www.juliet-designs.com.14.26 Ryan’s aerospace background came in handy when he modelled forces on the pedals and the
fork to identify stress concentrations on the frame. He used this information to determine the type and
number of layers of carbon fiber cloth needed. Arrow plots of the principal stresses across the frame
surface helped him determine the direction to orient the carbon cloth pieces with the fibers in pure
tension to contribute to the frame’s rigidity.14.27 This pictorial view was submitted as part of the patent process. Hidden lines show equipment
that is not a part of the patent, but which serves to convey its function.
Ryan currently works at Meta, designing robots and industrial automation
products for data centers, and enjoys riding his uniquely designed bicycles
with his wife and young son.

Assembly Drawings Using 3D CADExample of a Color Shaded Exploded View Assembly from PTC Creo (Copyright © PTC Inc.)
Great looking assembly drawings are only one of the benefits of using 3D
CAD for your designs. You can also check to see how parts fit together,
perform tolerance studies, and even see how mechanisms you are designing
will behave. Additionally, you can analyze the mass properties of your
design, determine the volume and surface area of complicated shapes, and
produce documentation drawings directly from the part models.
Software such as PTC Creo allows you to use color shaded views of
models in the exploded view assembly drawing, as shown in the figure
above.
As you decide whether to use a color shaded drawing or a black and white
line drawing for an assembly drawing, consider whether and how the
® ®
® ®drawing will be reproduced. Shaded color views make it easy to identify
and visualize the parts, but require color printing and copying to look their
best on paper. This does not present a problem if you are distributing files
electronically.
Even though color shaded drawings look great, there are times when black
and white drawings are preferable, or required. For example, patent
drawings must be black and white, showing visible lines and not hidden
lines. Black and white drawings are also helpful in user manuals, which
may be copied or printed in black and white.
With 3D CAD software, it is not difficult to switch between color shaded
views, outlines, and views that show hidden lines to suit the particular need
that the drawing will meet.

Chapter Summary
The final drawings created during the design process include assembly
drawings, working drawings, design drawings, and patent drawings.
There are many revisions to drawings during the design process. The
drafter must keep track of each version and what changes were made.
Managing complex projects often involves considering how parts are
grouped into subassemblies. Subassembly drawings are similar to
assembly drawings, but show a group of parts rather than the entire
project.
Assembly drawings may use one of several different types of views,
such as sections, exterior views, exploded views, pictorial views.
A parts list or bill of materials tracks the items in the assembly or
subassembly. As a minimum, it typically contains the item number,
description, quantity, and material for the parts.

Chapter Exercises
Design Exercises
The following suggestions for project assignments are of a general and very
broad nature, and it is expected that they will help generate many ideas for
specific design projects. Much design work is undertaken to improve an
existing product or system by utilization of new materials, new techniques,
or new systems or procedures. In addition to the design of the product itself,
another large amount of design work is essential for the tooling, production,
and handling of the product. You are encouraged to discuss with your
instructor any ideas you may have for a project.Each solution to a design problem, whether prepared by an individual
student or formulated by a group, should be in the form of a report, which
should be typed or carefully lettered, assembled, and bound. It is suggested
that the report contain the following (or variations of the following, as
specified by your instructor):
1. A title sheet. The title of the design project should be placed in
approximately the center of the sheet, and your name or the names of
those in the group in the lower right-hand corner. The symbol PL should
follow the name of the project leader.
2. Table of contents with page numbers.
3. Statement of the purpose of the project with appropriate comments.
4. Preliminary design sketches, with comments on advantages and
disadvantages of each, leading to the final selection of the best solution.
All work should be signed and dated.
5. An accurately made pictorial and/or assembly drawing(s), using
traditional drawing methods or CAD as assigned, if more than one part is
involved in the design.
6. Detail working drawings, freehand, mechanical, or CAD-produced as
assigned. The 8.5′′×11′′ sheet size is preferred for convenient insertion
in the report. Larger sizes may be bound in the report with appropriate
folding.
7. A bibliography or credit for important sources of information, if
applicable.Exercise 14.1 Design new or improved playground, recreational, or
sporting equipment. For example, a new child’s toy could be both
recreational and educational. Create an assembly drawing.
Exercise 14.2 Design new or improved health equipment. For example,
physically handicapped people need special equipment.
Exercise 14.3 Design a cup holder attachment to retrofit cars. It must
accommodate a range of cup sizes from 8 oz to 64 oz.
Exercise 14.4 Design a guitar stand to support either an acoustic or electric
guitar. It should be convenient and stable, suitable for use on stage. Allow
for quick change of guitars by the musician.
Exercise 14.5 Break up into design teams. See how many different ideas
each team can come up with for a new layout of your classroom. Time limit
is 20 minutes.
Exercise 14.6 Design a new or improved bike safety lock and chain.
Integrate the locking devices into the bike’s frame, if possible. Create an
assembly drawing showing the features of your design.
Working Drawing Exercises
The problems in Exercises 14.7–14.57 are presented to give you practice in
making the type of regular working drawings used in industry. Manyexercises, especially assemblies, offer an opportunity to exercise your
ability to redesign or improve on the existing design. Due to the variations
in sizes and in scales that may be used, you are required to select the sheet
sizes and scales, when these are not specified, subject to the approval of the
instructor. Standard sheet layouts are shown inside the front cover of this
book. (Any of the title forms shown inside the front cover of this book may
be used, with modification if desired, or you may design the title block if
assigned by the instructor.)
The statements for each problem are intentionally brief, and your instructor
may vary the requirements. Use the preferred metric system or the
acceptable complete decimal-inch system, as assigned.
In problems presented in pictorial form, the dimensions and finish marks
are to provide you the information necessary to make the orthographic
drawing or solid model. The dimensions given are in most cases those
needed to make the parts, but due to the limitations of pictorial drawings
they are not in all cases the dimensions that should be shown on the
working drawing. In the pictorial problems, the rough and finished surfaces
are shown, but finish marks are usually omitted. You should add all
necessary finish marks and place all dimensions in the preferred places in
the final drawings.Exercise 14.7 Create part drawings and an assembly for the optical lens and
mount. Maintain the critical distances and precise 45° angle for the lens.Exercise 14.8 Design the sheet metal housing for the power and D-sub
connectors shown. Download stock models for standard parts. Create the
flat patterns for the sheet metal if assigned by your instructor.Exercise 14.9 Design a sheet metal drill bit case. Create detailed part and

Overview
Multiview drawing makes it possible to represent the complex forms of a
design accurately by showing a series of views and sections, but reading
and interpreting this type of representation requires a thorough
understanding of the principles of multiview projection. Although
multiview drawings are commonly used to communicate information to a
technical audience, they do not show length, width, and height in a single
view and are hard for a layperson to visualize.It is often necessary to communicate designs to people who do not have the
technical training to interpret multiview projections. Axonometric
projections show all three principal dimensions using a single drawing
view, approximately as they appear to an observer. These projections are
often called pictorial drawings because they look more like a picture than
multiview drawings do. Because a pictorial drawing shows only the
appearance of an object, it is not usually suitable for completely describing
and dimensioning complex or detailed forms.
Pictorial drawings are also useful in developing design concepts. They can
help you picture the relationships between design elements and quickly
generate several solutions to a design problem.
Understanding Axonometric Projection
Projection Methods Reviewed
The four principal types of projection are illustrated in Figure 15.1. All
except the regular multiview projection (Figure 15.1a) are pictorial types
because they show several sides of the object in a single view. In both
multiview projection and axonometric projection (Figure 15.1b), the visual
rays are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the plane of projection.
Both are types of orthographic projections.15.1 Four Types of Projection
In oblique projection (Figure 15.1c), the visual rays are parallel to each
other but at an angle other than 90° to the plane of projection.
In perspective (Figure 15.1d), the visual rays extend from the observer’s
eye, or station point (SP), to all points of the object to form a “cone of rays”
so that the portions of the object that are farther away from the observer
appear smaller than the closer portions of the object.Review Chapter 3 for details on how to create basic pictorial sketches.
Types of Axonometric Projection
The feature that distinguishes axonometric projection from multiview
projection is the inclined position of the object with respect to the planes of
projection. When a surface or edge of the object is not parallel to the plane
of projection, it appears foreshortened. When an angle is not parallel to the
plane of projection, it appears either smaller or larger than the true angle.
To create an axonometric view, the object is tipped to the planes of
projection so that all of the principal faces show in a single view. This
produces a pictorial drawing that is easy to visualize. But, because the
principal edges and surfaces of the object are inclined to the plane of
projection, the lengths of the lines are foreshortened. The angles between
surfaces and edges appear either larger or smaller than the true angle. There
are an infinite variety of ways that the object may be oriented with respect
to the plane of projection.
The degree of foreshortening of any line depends on its angle to the plane
of projection. The greater the angle, the greater the foreshortening. If the
degree of foreshortening is determined for each of the three edges of the
cube that meet at one corner, scales can be constructed for measuring along
these edges or any other edges parallel to them (Figure 15.2).15.2 Measurements are foreshortened proportionately based on the amount of incline.
Use the three edges of the cube that meet at the corner nearest your view as
the axonometric axes. In Figure 15.1b, the axonometric axes, or simply the
axes, are OA, OB, and OC. Figure 15.3 shows three axonometric
projections with axes OX, OY, and OZ.
15.3 Axonometric Projections
Isometric projection (Figure 15.3a) has equal foreshortening along each of
the three axis directions.Dimetric projection (Figure 15.3b) has equal foreshortening along two axis
directions and a different amount of foreshortening along the third axis.
This is because the third axis is not tipped an equal amount to the principal
plane of projection.
Trimetric projection (Figure 15.3c) has different foreshortening along all
three axis directions. This view is produced by an object whose axes are not
equally tipped to the plane of projection.
15.1 Dimetric Projection
A dimetric projection is an axonometric projection of an object in which
two of its axes make equal angles with the plane of projection, and the third
axis makes either a smaller or a greater angle (Figure 15.4). The two axes
making equal angles with the plane of projection are foreshortened equally;
the third axis is foreshortened in a different proportion.15.4 Understanding Angles in Dimetric Projection
Usually, the object is oriented so one axis is vertical. However, you can
revolve the projection to any orientation if you want that particular view.
Do not confuse the angles between the axes in the drawing with the angles
from the plane projection. These are two different but related things. You
can arrange the amount that the principal faces are tilted to the plane of
projection in any way as long as the two angles between the axes are equal
and over 90°.
The scales can be determined graphically, as shown in Figure 15.5a, in
which OP, OL, and OS are the projections of the axes or converging edgesof a cube. If the triangle POS is revolved about the axis line PS into the
plane of projection, it will show its true size and shape as PO′S. If regular
full-size scales are marked along the lines O′P and O′S, and the triangle is
counterrevolved to its original position, the dimetric scales may be divided
along the axes OP and OS, as shown.
15.5 Dimetric Drawings
You can use an architect’s scale to make the measurements by assuming the
scales and calculating the positions of the axes, as follows:
cosa =
−√2h
2v
2−v
4
2hv
where a is one of the two equal angles between the projections of the axes,
h is one of the two equal scales, and v is the third scale. Examples are
shown in the upper row of Figure 15.4, where length measurements couldbe made using an architect’s scale. One of these three positions of the axes
will be found suitable for almost any practical drawing.
15.2 Approximate Dimetric Drawings
Approximate dimetric drawings, which closely resemble true dimetrics, can
be constructed by substituting for the true angles shown in the upper half of
Figure 15.4 angles that can be obtained with the ordinary triangles and
compass, as shown in the lower half of the figure. The resulting drawings
will be accurate enough for all practical purposes.
Step by Step
How to Make Dimetric DrawingsTo make a dimetric drawing for the views given, draw two
intersecting axis lines at angles of 7.5° and 45° from horizontal. Draw the
third axis vertically through them.
The dimensions for the principal face are measured full size. The
dimension for the receding axis direction will be at half scale.
Block in the features relative to the surfaces of the enclosing box. The
offset method of drawing a curve is shown in the figure.
An Approximate Dimetric DrawingFollow these steps to make a dimetric sketch with the position similar to
that in Figure 15.4e where the two angles are equal.
Using whichever angle produces a good drawing of your part, block
in the dimetric axes. An angle of 20° from horizontal tends to show many
parts well.
Block in the major features, foreshortening the dimensions along the
two receding axes to approximately 75%.
Darken the final lines.
15.3 Trimetric Projection
A trimetric projection is an axonometric projection of an object oriented so
that no two axes make equal angles with the plane of projection. In other
words, each of the three axes, and the lines parallel to them, have different
ratios of foreshortening. If the three axes are selected in any position on
paper so that none of the angles is less than 90°, and they are not an
isometric nor a dimetric projection, the result will be a trimetric projection.
15.4 Trimetric ScalesBecause the three axes are foreshortened differently, each axis will use
measurement proportions different from the other two. You can select
which scale to use, as shown in Figure 15.6. Any two of the three triangular
faces can be revolved into the plane of projection to show the true lengths
of the three axes. In the revolved position, the regular scale is used to set off
inches or fractions thereof. When the axes have been counterrevolved to
their original positions, the scales will be correctly foreshortened, as shown.
15.6 Trimetric Scales
TipYou can make scales from thin card stock and transfer these dimensions to
each card for easy reference. You might even want to make a trimetric
angle from Bristol Board or plastic, as shown here, or six or seven of them,
using angles for a variety of positions of the axes.
15.5 Trimetric Ellipses
The trimetric centerlines of a hole, or the end of a cylinder, become the
conjugate diameters of an ellipse when drawn in trimetric. The ellipse may
be drawn on the conjugate diameters or you can determine the major and
minor axes from the conjugate diameters and construct the ellipse on them
with an ellipse template or by any of the methods shown in Chapter 3.
One advantage of trimetric projection is the infinite number of positions of
the object available. The angles and scales can be handled without too much
difficulty, as shown in Section 15.4. However, in drawing any axonometric
ellipse, keep the following in mind:1. On the drawing, the major axis is always perpendicular to the centerline,
or axis, of the cylinder.
2. The minor axis is always perpendicular to the major axis; on the paper it
coincides with the axis of the cylinder.
3. The length of the major axis is equal to the actual diameter of the
cylinder.
The directions of both the major and minor axes, and the length of the
major axis, will always be known, but not the length of the minor axis.
Once it is determined, you can construct the ellipse using a template or any
of a number of ellipse constructions. For sketching you can generally sketch
an ellipse that looks correct by eye.
In Figure 15.7a, locate center O as desired, and draw the horizontal and
vertical construction lines that will contain the major and minor axes
through O. Note that the major axis will be on the horizontal line
perpendicular to the axis of the hole, and the minor axis will be
perpendicular to it, or vertical.15.7 Ellipses in Trimetric (Method (b) courtesy of Professor H. E. Grant.)
Use the actual radius of the hole and draw the semicircle, as shown, to
establish the ends A and B of the major axis. Draw AF and BF parallel to
the axonometric edges WX and YX, respectively, to locate F, which lies on
the ellipse. Draw a vertical line through F to intersect the semicircle at F′
and join F′ to B, as shown. From D′, where the minor axis, extended,
intersects the semicircle, draw D′E and ED parallel to F′B and BF,
respectively. Point D is one end of the minor axis. From center O, strike arc
DC to locate C, the other end of the minor axis. On these axes, a true ellipse
can be constructed, or drawn with an ellipse template.
See Chapter 3 for additional methods for constructing ellipses.
In constructions where the enclosing parallelogram for an ellipse is
available or easily constructed, the major and minor axes can be determinedas shown in Figure 15.7b. The directions of both axes and the length of the
major axis are known. Extend the axes to intersect the sides of the
parallelogram at L and M, and join the points with a straight line. From one
end N of the major axis, draw a line NP parallel to LM. The point P is one
end of the minor axis. To find one end T of the minor axis of the smaller
ellipse, it is necessary only to draw RT parallel to LM or NP.
The method of constructing an ellipse on an oblique plane in trimetric is
similar to that shown in the Step by Step in Chapter 3 for drawing an
isometric ellipse by offset measurements.
Tip
When you are creating a trimetric sketch of an ellipse, it works great to
block in the trimetric rectangle that would enclose the ellipse and sketch
the ellipse tangent to the midpoints of the rectangle.
Presentation Drawing
The MARGE (Mars Autonomous Rover for Geoscience Exploration)
aeroshell, shown at right, is part of a NASA Scout mission proposal
developed by Malin Space Science Systems and the Raytheon Company in
2005 and 2006. The blunt, conical MARGE aeroshell is an integratedsystem providing safe delivery of its payload, two small, autonomous
rovers, to the surface of Mars. The aeroshell is about 2.4 m in diameter.
Shown here is the part of the system that provides aerobraking for the
spacecraft’s initial descent from orbit, the terminal rocket descent phase just
before landing, and the final soft touchdown with the surface. With the
protective backshell (where the parachute is located) and rovers removed,
you can clearly see the components of the propulsion and control systems
integrated into the rover egress deck, color coded for clarity. In addition to
aerobraking and rocket-powered descent, the MARGE aeroshell design
incorporates crushable foam layers of increasing density to cushion the final
touchdown with the planet surface. After the descent and landing phase is
complete, clamps are disengaged, and the rovers drive off the lip of the
aeroshell under their own power.Shaded isometric views of 3D models are often used as presentation drawings. This isometric view of
a proposed design for the MARGE aeroshell was used as a presentation drawing to communicate the
features of a concept developed by Malin Aerospace. (Courtesy of Malin Space Science Systems, Inc.)
15.6 Axonometric Projection Using Intersections
Before the advent of CAD engineering, scholars devised methods to create
an axonometric projection using projections from two orthographic views
of the object. This method, called the method of intersections, was
developed by Professors L. Eckhart and T. Schmid of the Vienna College of
Engineering and was published in 1937.To understand their method of axonometric projection, study Figure 15.8 as
you read through the following steps. Assume that the axonometric
projection of a rectangular object is given, and it is necessary to find the
three orthographic projections: the top view, front view, and side view.
15.8 Views from an Axonometric Projection
Place the object so that its principal edges coincide with the coordinate
axes, and the plane of projection (the plane on which the axonometricprojection is drawn) intersects the three coordinate planes in the triangle
ABC.
From descriptive geometry, we know that lines BC, CA, and AB will be
perpendicular, respectively, to axes OX, OY, and OZ. Any one of the three
points A, B, or C may be assumed anywhere on one of the axes to draw
triangle ABC.
To find the true size and shape of the top view, revolve the triangular
portion of the horizontal plane AOC, which is in front of the plane of
projection, about its base CA, into the plane of projection. In this case, the
triangle is revolved inward to the plane of projection through the smallest
angle made with it. The triangle would then be shown in its true size and
shape, and you could draw the top view of the object in the triangle by
projecting from the axonometric projection, as shown (because all width
dimensions remain the same).
In the figure, the base CA of the triangle has been moved upward to C′A′
so that the revolved position of the triangle will not overlap its projection.
The true sizes and shapes of the front view and side view can be found
similarly, as shown in the figure.
Note that if the three orthographic projections, or in most cases any two of
them, are given in their relative positions, as shown in Figure 15.8, thedirections of the projections could be reversed so that the intersections of
the projecting lines would determine the axonometric projection needed.
Use of an Enclosing Box to Create an Isometric Sketch using
Intersections
To draw an axonometric projection using intersections, it helps to make a
sketch of the desired general appearance of the projection as shown in
Figure 15.9. Even for complex objects the sketch need not be complete, just
an enclosing box. Draw the projections of the coordinate axes OX, OY, and
OZ parallel to the principal edges of the object, as shown in the sketch, and
the three coordinate planes with the plane of projection.15.9 Axonometric Projection
Revolve the triangle ABO about its base AB as the axis into the plane of
projection. Line OA will revolve to O′A, and this line, or one parallel to it,
must be used as the baseline of the front view of the object. Draw the
projecting lines from the front view to the axonometric parallel to the
projection of the unrevolved Z-axis, as indicated in the figure.Similarly, revolve the triangle COB about its base CB as the axis into the
plane of projection. Line CO will revolve to CO′. Use this line, or one
parallel to it, as the baseline of the side view. Make the direction of the
projecting lines parallel to the projection of the unrevolved X axis, as
shown.
Draw the front view baseline at a convenient location parallel to O′A. Use
the parallel line you drew (P3) as the base and draw the front view of the
object. Draw the side view baseline at a convenient location parallel to O′C
. Use it as the base (P2) for the side view of the object, as shown. From the
corners of the front view, draw projecting lines parallel to OZ. From the
corners of the side view, draw projecting lines parallel to OX. The
intersections of these two sets of projecting lines determine the axonometric
projection. It will be an isometric, a dimetric, or a trimetric projection,
depending on the form of the sketch used as the basis for the projections.
If the angles formed by the three coordinate axes are equal, the projection is
isometric; if two of them are equal, the projection is dimetric; and if none of
the three angles are equal, the result is a trimetric projection.
To place the desired projection on a specific location on the drawing (Figure
15.9), select the desired projection P of point 1, for example, and draw two
projecting lines PR and PS to intersect the two baselines and thereby to
determine the locations of the two views on their baselines.Another example of this method of axonometric projection is shown in
Figure 15.10. In this case, it was necessary only to draw a sketch of the plan
or base of the object in the desired position.
15.10 Axonometric ProjectionTo understand how the axonometric projection in Figure 15.10 was created,
examine the figure while reading through these steps.
Draw the axes with OX and OZ parallel to the sides of the sketch plan, and
the remaining axis OY in a vertical position.
Revolve triangles COB and AOB, and draw the two baselines parallel to 
O′′C and O′A.
Choose point P, the lower front corner of the axonometric drawing, at a
convenient place, and draw projecting lines toward the baselines parallel to
axes OX and OZ to locate their positions. You can draw the views on the
baselines or even cut them apart from another drawing and fasten them in
place with drafting tape.
To draw the elliptical projection of the circle, use any points, such as A, on
the circle in both front and side views. Note that point A is the same
altitude, d, above the baseline in both views. Draw the axonometric
projection of point A by projecting lines from the two views. You can
project the major and minor axes this way, or by the methods shown in
Figure 15.7.
True ellipses may be drawn by any of the methods shown in Chapter 3 or
with an ellipse template. An approximate ellipse is fine for most drawings.
15.7 Computer GraphicsPictorial drawings of all sorts can be created using 3D CAD (Figures 15.11
and 15.12). To create pictorials using 2D CAD, use projection techniques
similar to those presented in this chapter. The advantage of 3D CAD is that
once you make a 3D model of a part or assembly, you can change the
viewing direction at any time for orthographic, isometric, or perspective
views. You can also apply different materials to the drawing objects and
shade them to produce a high degree of realism in the pictorial view.15.11 Shaded Dimetric Pictorial View from a 3D Model (Courtesy of Robert Kincaid.)15.12 Isometric Assembly Drawing (Courtesy of Robert Kincaid.)15.8 Oblique Projections
In oblique projections, the projectors are parallel to each other but are not
perpendicular to the plane of projection. To create an oblique projection,
orient the object so that one of its principal faces is parallel to the plane of
projection, as illustrated in Figure 15.13. Bear in mind that the goal is to
produce an informative drawing. Orient the surface showing the most
information about the shape of the object so it is parallel to the plane of
projection.
15.13 Comparison of Oblique and Orthographic ProjectionsFigures 15.14, 15.15, and 15.16 show comparisons between oblique
projection, orthographic projection, and isometric projection for a cube and
a cylinder. In oblique projection, the front face is identical in the front
orthographic view.15.14 Comparison of Oblique and Isometric Projections15.15 Circles Parallel to Plane of Projection
15.16 Comparison of Oblique and Isometric Projections for a CylinderIf an object is placed with one of its faces parallel to the plane of projection,
the projected view will show the face true size and shape. This makes
oblique drawings easier than isometric or other axonometric projection such
as dimetric or trimetric for many shapes. Surfaces that are not parallel to the
plane of projection will not project in true size and shape.
In axonometric drawings, circular shapes nearly always project as ellipses,
because the principal faces are inclined to the viewing plane. If you position
the object so that those surfaces are parallel to the viewing plane and draw
an oblique projection, the circles will project as true shape and are easy to
draw.
Oblique projections show the object from an angle where the projectors are
not parallel to the viewing plane. An axis (such as AB of the cylinder in
Figure 15.15) projects as a point (A
VB
V) in the orthographic view where
the line of sight is parallel to AB. But in the oblique projection, the axis
projects as line A′B′. The more nearly the direction of sight approaches
being perpendicular to the plane of projection, the closer the oblique
projection moves toward the orthographic projection, and the shorter A′B′
becomes.
Directions of Projectors
In Figure 15.17, the projectors make an angle of 45° with the plane of
projection, so line CD′, which is perpendicular to the plane, projects true
length at C′D′. If the projectors make a greater angle with the plane ofprojection, the oblique projection is shorter, and if the projectors make a
smaller angle with the plane of projection, the oblique projection is longer.
Theoretically, CD′ could project to any length from zero to infinity.
15.17 Lengths of Projections
Line AB is parallel to the plane and will project true length regardless of the
angle the projectors makes with the plane of projection.
In Figure 15.13, the lines AE, BF, CG, and DH are perpendicular to the
plane of projection and project as parallel inclined lines A′E′, B′F′, C′G′,
and D′H′ in the oblique projection. These lines on the drawing are called
the receding lines. They may be any length, depending on the direction of
sight.What angle will these lines be in the drawing measured from horizontal? In
Figure 15.18, line AO is perpendicular to the plane of projection, and all the
projectors make angles of 45° with it; therefore, all the oblique projections
like BO, CO, and DO are equal in length to line AO. You can select the
projectors at any angle and still produce any desired angle with the plane of
projection. The directions of the projections BO, CO, DO, and so on, are
independent of the angles the projectors make with the plane of projection.
Traditionally, the angle used is 45°(CO in the figure), 30°, or 60° with
horizontal.
15.18 Directions and Projections
15.9 Ellipses for Oblique DrawingsIt is not always possible to orient the view of an object so that all its
rounded shapes are parallel to the plane of projection. For example, the
object shown in Figure 15.19a has two sets of circular contours in different
planes. Both cannot be simultaneously placed parallel to the plane of
projection, so in the oblique projection, one of them must be viewed as an
ellipse.
15.19 Circles and Arcs Not Parallel to Plane of Projection
If you are sketching, you can just block in the enclosing rectangle and
sketch the ellipse tangent to its sides. Using CAD, you can draw the ellipse
by specifying its center and major and minor axes. In circumstances where
a CAD system is not available, if you need an accurate ellipse, you can
draw it by hand using one of the following methods.
Alternative Four-Center Ellipses
Normal four-center ellipses can be made only in an equilateral
parallelogram, so they cannot be used in an oblique drawing where the
receding axis is foreshortened. Instead, use this alternative four-center
ellipse to approximate ellipses in oblique drawings.Draw the ellipse on two centerlines, as shown in Figure 15.20. This is the
same method as is sometimes used in isometric drawings, but in oblique
drawings it appears slightly different according to the different angles of the
receding lines.
15.20 Alternative Four-Center Ellipse
First, draw the two centerlines. Then, from the center, draw a construction
circle equal to the diameter of the actual hole or cylinder. The circle will
intersect each centerline at two points. From the two points on one
centerline, draw perpendiculars to the other centerline. Then, from the two
points on the other centerline, draw perpendiculars to the first centerline.
From the intersections of the perpendiculars, draw four circular arcs, as
shown.
Four-Center Ellipse for Cavalier DrawingsFor cavalier drawings, you can use the normal four-center ellipse method to
draw ellipses (Figure 15.19b). This method can be used only in cavalier
drawing because the receding axis is drawn to full scale, forming an
equilateral parallelogram.
To approximate the ellipse in the angled plane, draw the enclosing
parallelogram. Then, draw the perpendicular bisectors to the four sides of
the parallelogram. The intersections of the perpendicular bisectors will be
centers for the four circular arcs that form the approximate ellipse. If the
angle of the receding lines is anything other than 30° from horizontal, as in
this case, the centers of the two large arcs will not fall in the corners of the
parallelogram.
When using a CAD system, you can quickly construct accurate ellipses and
do not need these methods, but knowing them may be helpful for drawing
in the field, or under other circumstances where CAD may not be readily
available.
15.10 Offset Measurements
Circles, circular arcs, and other curved or irregular lines can be drawn using
offset measurements, as shown in Figure 15.21. Draw the offsets on the
multiview drawing of the curve (Figure 15.21a), and transfer them to the
oblique drawing (Figure 15.21b). In this case, the receding axis is full scale;therefore all offset measurements are drawn full scale. The four-center
ellipse could be used, but this method is more accurate.
15.21 Use of Offset Measurements
In a cabinet drawing (Figure 15.21c) or any oblique drawing where the
receding axis is at a reduced scale, the offset measurements along the
receding axis must be drawn to the same reduced scale. The four-center
ellipse cannot be used when the receding axis is not full scale. A method of
drawing ellipses in a cabinet drawing of a cube is shown in Figure 15.21d.
Figure 15.22 shows a free curve drawn by means of offset measurements in
an oblique drawing and also illustrates hidden lines used to make the
drawing clearer.15.22 Use of Offset Measurements
Offset measurements can be used to draw an ellipse in an inclined plane, as
shown in Figure 15.23. In Figure 15.23a, parallel lines represent imaginary
cutting planes. Each plane cuts a rectangular surface between the front of
the cylinder and the inclined surface. These rectangles are shown in the
oblique drawing in Figure 15.23b. The curve is drawn through the corner
points. The final cavalier drawing is shown in Figure 15.23c.
15.23 Use of Offset Measurements15.11 Oblique Dimensioning
You can dimension oblique drawings in a way similar to that used for
isometric drawings. Follow the general principles of dimensioning that you
learned in Chapter 11.
As shown in Figure 15.24, all dimension lines, extension lines, and
arrowheads must lie in the planes of the object to which they apply. You
should also place the dimension values in the corresponding planes when
using the aligned dimensioning system (Figure 15.24a). For the preferred
unidirectional system of dimensioning, all dimension figures are horizontal
and read from the bottom of the drawing (Figure 15.24b). Use vertical
lettering for all pictorial dimensioning.15.24 Oblique Dimensioning
Place dimensions outside the outlines of the drawing except when clarity is
improved by placing the dimensions directly on the view.
15.12 Computer GraphicsUsing CAD you can easily create oblique drawings by using a snap
increment and drawing in much the same way as on grid paper. If necessary,
adjust for the desired amount of foreshortening along the receding axis as
well as the preferred direction of the axis. You can use CAD commands to
draw curves, ellipses, elliptical arcs, and other similar features. However if
you need a complicated detailed pictorial, it is often easier and more
accurate to create a 3D model rather than an oblique view.

Cad at Work
Quick Oblique Drawing Using AutocadYou can use the snap tool available in the AutoCAD software to make a
quick oblique drawing. An oblique drawing is a 2D drawing that gives the
appearance of 3D by showing the object angled so that it shows all the
major surfaces in one pictorial view.
To Create a Quick Oblique Drawing
Use methods similar to that for creating a sketch on paper:
1. Draw the front view of the object.
2. Use the snap increment or the polar tracking to draw one of the receding
lines showing the depth of the object.
3. Copy the front surface to the back.
4. Add the receding edges.
3D solid models are rarely ever shown in oblique views. It is as quick and
easy to create a 3D solid model and produce a view of that as it is to make
an oblique sketch, but depending on your need, you may choose either
option.
To Create a Solid Model
1. Draw the front view.
2. Use the region command to create 2D areas from the drawing lines.
3. Subtract the areas that are holes from the exterior.4. View the drawing from an angle so that you can see the results when you
produce the 3D part.
5. Extrude the region to create a 3D solid.
6. Orbit the drawing to change your 3D viewpoint.

Chapter Summary
An axonometric drawing is created by rotating an object about imaginary
vertical and horizontal axes until three adjacent views, usually the top,
front, and right-side view, can all be seen at the same time.
Inclined surfaces and oblique surfaces must be determined by plotting
the endpoints of each edge of the surface.Angles, irregular curves, and ellipses require special construction
techniques for accurate representation.
A common method of drawing an object in isometric is by creating an
isometric box and drawing the features of the object within the box.
Unlike perspective drawing, in which parallel lines converge on a
vanishing point, parallel lines are drawn parallel in axonometric
drawings.
Oblique projection makes drawing circles in the projection plane easier
than with other pictorial projection methods.
Oblique drawings of circular features are often created by first drawing a
skeleton of centerlines.
There is usually no reason for creating oblique drawings using CAD,
because isometric drawings are easier to make with CAD and appear
more photorealistic.
Oblique projection is a common sketching method because the front
view is true size and true shape and easier to draw.

Refer to the following standard:
ANSI/ASME Y14.3 Orthographic and Pictorial ViewsThis photo from Windermere in the English Lake District shows the wooden jetty vanishing toward
the horizon. (Kevin Eaves/123RF.)
Overview
Perspective, or central projection, is the most realistic-looking of the
pictorial drawing styles because it is closest to the way humans see. An
ordinary photograph shows the view in perspective, with objects in the
foreground appearing larger, and objects in the background diminishing
until they appear to vanish.
Architects, industrial designers, illustrators, and engineers should
understand the basic principles of perspective because this method is usedin creating sophisticated presentation drawings and in basic design
sketching.
Unlike axonometric projection, where projection lines from the object
remain parallel to one another, perspective projection shows parallel edges
converging at vanishing points, as we would view them in a photograph. To
make complex and accurate perspective drawings, you can project every
point and edge of an object from a multiview drawing.
The three types of perspective are one-point, two-point, and three-point
perspective. CAD software can easily render perspective projections from
3D models, but it is still important to understand the basic principles that
produce the view.
Understanding Perspectives
A perspective drawing involves four main elements:
The observer’s eye
The object being viewed
The plane of projection
The projectors from the observer’s eye to all points on the object
The plane of projection is placed between the observer and the object, as
shown in Figure 16.1. The perspective view is produced where the
perspective projectors pierce the plane of projection.16.1 Looking Through the Picture Plane
Figure 16.1 shows an observer looking along a boulevard and through an
imaginary plane of projection. This plane is called the picture plane (PP).
The position of the observer’s eye is called the station point (SP). The lines
from the station point to the various points in the scene are the projectors, or
visual rays. The visual rays pierce the picture plane giving perspectives of
the points. Together, these piercing points form the perspective view of the
object or the scene as viewed by the observer. Figure 16.2 shows the
perspective view of the objects projected onto the picture plane from the
point of view of the observer in Figure 16.1. Each lamppost projects smaller
than the preceding one as it is farther from the observer. A lamppost in the
picture plane would be projected in true length.16.2 A Perspective
In Figure 16.1, a line represents the horizon. The horizon represents the eye
level of the observer (SP). In Figure 16.1, the ground plane is the edge view
of the ground on which the object usually rests. In Figure 16.2, the ground
line (GL) is the intersection of the ground plane with the picture plane.
Lines that are parallel to each other but not parallel to the picture plane,
such as curb lines, sidewalk lines, and lines along the tops and bottoms of
the lampposts, all converge toward a single point on the horizon. This point
is called the vanishing point (VP) of the lines.
The following are some rules to learn for perspective:
All parallel lines that are not parallel to the picture plane vanish at a
point.
If these lines are parallel to the ground, the vanishing point will be on the
horizon.
Lines that are parallel to the picture plane, such as the vertical axis of
each lamppost, remain parallel to one another and do not converge
toward a vanishing point.
16.1 Perspective From a Multiview Projection
It is possible to draw a perspective from a multiview projection, as shown
in Figure 16.3. The upper portion of the drawing shows the top view of thestation point, the picture plane, the object, and the visual rays. The right￾side view shows the same station point, picture plane, object, and visual
rays.
16.3 Multiview Method of Drawing Perspective
In the front view, the picture plane coincides with the plane of the paper,
and the perspective view is drawn on it. Depth measurements aretransferred from the top view to the side view, using the usual multiview
projection techniques.
To show point 1 in the perspective view, you would:
1. Draw a visual ray in the top view from SPT to point 1 on the object in
the top view.
2. Draw a projection line downward into the perspective view where your
ray crosses the picture plane (1′).
3. Locate point 1 in the perspective view where your vertical line meets a
similar projection line from the side view.
Find the perspective locations of other points in the same way and then
draw the visible and hidden lines between the endpoints you projected into
the perspective view.
Examine the perspective drawing shown in Figure 16.3. All parallel lines
that are also parallel to the picture plane (the vertical lines) remain parallel
and do not converge. The other two sets of parallel lines converge toward
vanishing points. If the converging lines from the edges in the perspective
view were extended, they would meet at two vanishing points (one for each
set of parallel lines, as illustrated in Figure 16.4).16.4 Perspective of a Prism
It is possible to construct the perspective of any object this way, but this
method is rather cumbersome because the top and side views usually show
the object in an angled position.
16.2 Nonrotated Side View Method for Perspective
Figure 16.4 shows a simpler construction for a perspective. The upper
portion of the drawing shows the top views of the station point, pictureplane, and the object. The lines SP-1, SP-2, SP-3, and SP-4 are the top
views of the visual rays.
Details of the actual side view for the given top view are not required. Any
side view drawn in that location can provide the necessary height
measurements.
The perspective view is drawn on the picture plane where the front view
would usually be located.
The side view shows the edge view of the ground line on which the object
is resting.
The perspective view shows the intersection of the ground plane with the
picture plane. In the perspective view, the horizon shows as a horizontal
line. Since the horizon plane passes through the observer’s eye, or SP, it is
drawn at the level of the eye—that is, at the distance above the ground line
representing (to scale) the height of the eye above the ground.
The center of vision (CV), is the orthographic projection (or front view) of
the station point on the picture plane of the perspective view. Because the
horizon is at eye level, the center of vision will always be on the horizon,
except in three-point perspectives.
As shown in Figure 16.4, you would locate the center of vision (CV′) in
the top view by projecting a perpendicular line from the station point (SP)to the picture plane (PP). You would locate CV in the front view by
projecting downward from CV′ to the horizon.
Note that vertical heights can be measured only in the picture plane. If the
front vertical edge 1′−5′ of the object were actually situated in the picture
plane, the vertical height would be full size. If the vertical edge is behind
the picture plane, you can extend a plane of the object, such as surface 1-2-
5-6, forward until it intersects the picture plane (line TQ). The line TQ is
called a measuring line. The true height (SQ) of line 1-5 can be measured
with a scale or projected from the side view as shown.
If your drawing area is not large enough, one vanishing point, such as VPR,
may be off the sheet. By using one vanishing point VPL and projecting
down from the piercing points in PP, vanishing point VPR may be
eliminated. The second vanishing point allows for checking, so it is best to
draw it if space permits.
Drawing perspective views of horizontal lines that are not parallel to the
picture plan is not difficult if you understand the process. Steps for finding
line 1′−2′ in the perspective view are detailed on the next page.
Step by Step
Drawing Perspectives of Horizontal Straight Lines that are not Parallel
to the Picture PlaneFind the piercing point of line 1-2.
Find the vanishing point for line 1′−2′.Draw a line from the piercing point of line 1-2 in the perspective
view (point S) to its vanishing point.Locate the endpoints of the line 1-2 in the perspective view. Project
down from the piercing points of the visual rays in the picture plane (PP) to
find the endpoints of line 1-2 as it appears in the perspective view (1′ and 
2′), or draw the perspectives of the remaining horizontal edges of the object
to find where they intersect. Better yet, use both methods to check your
work.After you draw all horizontal edges in the perspective, draw the
vertical and inclined edges to complete the perspective as shown in Figure
16.4.
16.3 Drawing an Angular Perspective
Because objects are defined principally by edges that are straight lines,
drawing a complex perspective is just a series of drawings of the
perspective of lines. If you can draw the perspective of a line, you can draw
the perspective of any object, no matter how complex.
16.4 Position of the Station Point
The centerline of the cone of visual rays should be directed toward the
approximate center, or center of interest, of the object. In two-point
perspective (Figure 16.4), locating the station point (SP) in the plan view
slightly to the left and not directly in front of the center of the object
produces a better view, as if the object is seen at a glance without turning
the head. Use a cone of rays with its vertex at the station point and a vertical
angle of about 30° entirely enclosing the object, as shown in Figure 16.5, to
produce this effect.16.5 Distance from SP to Object
The station point (SP) does not appear in the perspective view in Figure
16.4, because the station point is in front of the picture plane. The
orthographic projection center of vision (CV) of the station point (SP) in
the picture plane shows the height of the station point measured from the
ground plane. It also shows the altitude of the station point, because the
horizon is at eye level.
Draw the horizon in the perspective view at the same level above the
ground line that you want to use as the height of the station point. Most
small and medium-size objects, such as machine parts or furniture, look
best when the station point is slightly above the top of the object. Largeobjects, such as buildings, are usually viewed from a station point at about
the height of the eye above the ground, or about 5′6′′.
16.5 Location of the Picture Plane
The picture plane can be placed:
In front of the object, as in Figure 16.6b and Figure 16.6c, which is the
most common.
16.6 Location of Picture Plane
Behind the object, as in Figure 16.7a.16.7 Object and Horizon
Behind the station point (SP), as in Figure 16.6d, in which case the
perspective is reversed, as through a camera lens.
The perspectives in Figure 16.6 differ in size but not in proportion. As in
Figures 16.6b and 16.6c, the farther the plane is from the object, the smaller
the perspective drawing will be. This distance controls the scale of the
perspective. Usually, the object is placed with the front corner in the picture
plane to make vertical measurements easier.16.6 Bird’s-Eye View or Worm’s-Eye View
The horizon is level with the observer’s eye, so controlling the location for
the horizon line controls whether the perspective view appears from above
or below the object. The horizon line is defined by the observer’s point of
view.
To produce a perspective view that shows the objects as though viewed
from above, place the object below the horizon line. To produce a
perspective view that shows the object as though viewed from below, place
the object above the horizon line. This is not the case in three-point
perspective (see Section 16.11). The differences in effect produced by
placing the object on, above, or below the horizon are shown in Figure 16.7.
16.7 The Three Types of Perspectives
Perspective drawings are classified according to their number of vanishing
points, which are determined by the position of the object with respect to
the picture plane.
If the object is situated with one face parallel to the plane of projection,
only one vanishing point is required, and the result is a one-point
perspective, or parallel perspective.
If the object is situated at an angle with the picture plane but with vertical
edges parallel to the picture plane, two vanishing points are required, andthe result is a two-point perspective, or an angular perspective. This is the
most common type of perspective drawing.
If the object is situated so that no principal faces or edges are parallel to the
picture plane, three vanishing points are necessary, and the result is a three￾point perspective.
16.8 One-Point Perspective
In one-point perspective, orient the object so two sets of its principal edges
are parallel to the picture plane (essentially a flat surface parallel to the
picture plane) and the third set is perpendicular to the picture plane. This
third set of parallel lines will converge toward a single vanishing point in
perspective.
Figure 16.8 shows the object with one face parallel to the picture plane. If
desired, this face could be placed in the picture plane. The piercing points
of the eight edges perpendicular to the picture plane (PP) are found by
extending them to PP and then projecting downward to the level of the lines
as projected across from the elevation view.16.8 One-Point Perspective
To find the vanishing points (VP) of these lines, draw a visual ray from the
station point (SP) parallel to the lines (as in Step 2 on page 16-7). The
vanishing point of all lines perpendicular to the picture plane (PP) is in the
center of vision (CV). Connect the eight piercing points with the vanishing
point (which is also the center of vision) to find the directions for the
perspective lines of the eight edges.To show the actual lengths of the edges of the object along the perspective
lines, draw horizontal lines from the endpoints of one of the edges in the top
view and at any desired angle with the picture plane (for this example, 45°).
Find the piercing points and the vanishing point VPR of these lines and
draw the perspectives of the lines. The intersections of these lines with the
perspectives of the corresponding edges of the object produce the length of
the receding edges. Use them to complete the perspective of the object.
Building interiors are sometimes shown using parallel perspective.
16.9 One-Point Perspective of a Cylindrical Shape
A one-point perspective representing a cylindrical machine part is shown in
Figure 16.9. The front surface of the cylinder is placed in the picture plane.
All circular shapes are parallel to the picture plane, and they project as
circles and circular arcs in the perspective. The station point (SP) is located
in front and to one side of the object. The horizon is placed above the
ground line. The single vanishing point is on the horizon in the center of
vision.16.9 One-Point Perspective
The two circles and the keyway in the front surface of the object are drawn
true shape because they lie in parallel to the view as they are in the picture
plane. The circles are drawn with the center at point O′. To locate the center
of the large arc in perspective (R′), draw a visual ray from SP to R in thetop view. Then, from the intersection of the ray with the picture plane (X),
project down to the centerline of the large cylinder, to find the center of the
arc in the perspective.
To find the radius T′W′ at the right end of the perspective view, draw
visual rays SP-T and SP-W, and from their intersections with the picture
plane (PP), project down to T′ and W′ on the horizontal centerline of the
hole.
16.10 Two-Point Perspective
In two-point perspective, the object is oriented so that one set of parallel
edges is vertical and has no vanishing point, whereas the two other sets
have vanishing points. Two-point perspectives are often used to show
buildings in an architectural drawing, or large structures in civil
engineering, such as dams or bridges, especially for client presentation
drawings.
The perspective drawing of a small building is shown in Figure 16.10. To
make it easier to draw two point perspective:16.10 Two-Point Perspective Drawing of a Building
1. Show an edge of the object in the picture plane so that measurements
may be made directly from it.
2. Orient the object so that its faces make unequal angles with the picture
plane; for example, one angle may be 30° and the other 60°.The front corner (AB) lies in the picture plane (PP). It will be full scale in
the perspective view (A′B′). To draw it, project downward from the top
view (plan view) and across from the side view (elevation view). Draw
visual rays from the station point to the corners of the building in the top
view. Project these corners to the picture plane in the top view (S and R).
Then, draw the vertical lines (S − C′ and R − E′) from the intersections S
and R to locate the corners in the perspective view where they will appear
as vertical lines. The perspectives of the tops of the windows and the door
are determined by the lines A′− VPR and A′− VPL. Their widths and
lateral spacings are determined by projecting downward from the
intersections with the picture plane of the respective visual rays. The
bottom lines of the windows are determined by the lines V′− VPR and 
V′− VPL.
Find the perspective view of the roof ridge line by joining N′, projected
down from the point where the ridge line pierces the picture plane, and
VPR. Find the ridge endpoints O′ and Q′ by projecting down from the
intersections of the visual rays with the picture plane, or by drawing the
perspectives of any two lines intersecting at the vanishing points. Complete
the perspective of the roof by joining the points O′ and Q′ to the ends of the
eaves.
TipWhen multiview drawings are already available, tape their top (plan) and
side (elevation) views in position, and use them to construct the
perspective. When you are finished, remove the taped portions.
16.11 Three-Point Perspective
In three point perspective, the object is placed so that none of its principal
faces or edges are parallel to the picture plane. This means that each of the
three sets of parallel edges will have a separate vanishing point (Figure
16.11). The picture plane is approximately perpendicular to the centerline of
the cone of visual rays.16.11 Three-Point PerspectiveIn this figure, think of the paper as the picture plane, with the object behind
the paper and placed so that all its edges make an angle with the picture
plane. The center of vision (CV) represents the orthographic location of
your eye, or the station point, on the picture plane. The vanishing points P,
Q, and R are lines drawn from a station point parallel to the principal axes
of the object and then projected to locate their piercing points in the picture
planes.
Remember that to find the vanishing point of a line in any type of
perspective you draw a visual ray, or line, from the station point parallel to
that edge of the object, then find the piercing point of this ray in the picture
plane. When the object is rectangular, these lines to the vanishing points are
at right angles to each other exactly, as the axes are in axonometric
projection. The lines PQ, QR, and RP are perpendicular, respectively, to
CV-R, CV-P, and CV-Q and are the vanishing traces, or horizon lines, of
planes through the station point (SP) parallel to the principal faces of the
object.
The imaginary corner O is assumed in the picture plane and may coincide
with CV; but as a rule, the front corner is placed at one side near CV,
showing the observer’s position relative to the object’s corner.
In this method you draw the perspective directly from measurements and
not projected from views. Now that you have the background information,follow these steps to create a general three-point perspective of the drawing
shown in Figure 16.11.
Tip
You can sketch a three-point perspective by selecting the vanishing points
and finding the center of vision by drawing the perpendicular bisectors. If
you place the object at the center of vision, the edge lines will recede from
that point toward the vanishing points. You can estimate proportionate
distances to create a sketch that has a pleasing appearance.
Near the center of the paper, make a light mark that you will use as the
center of view (CV).
Above the center of vision (for a bird’s-eye view), sketch a horizontal line
to use as the horizon line.
Extend a light line from the center of view (CV) to the right and left
vanishing points on the horizon line (Q and P).
Extend a light line from the center of view (CV) to a vanishing point below
the object (R).
Connect these three vanishing points with straight lines to form a triangle.
Perpendicular lines from each vanishing point to the opposite side will cross
at the center of vision (CV).Construct the station points by extending these perpendicular bisectors to
find SP1 and SP2.
Draw lines SP1 − R, SP1 − Q, SP2 − P, and SP2 − Q.
Draw a line from vanishing point Q parallel to SP1 − R. This will be the
front line of the perspective object.
Draw a line from vanishing point P parallel to SP2 − Q. This will be the
left line of the perspective object.
Extend a line from the intersection of the two lines you just drew (from
point O) to vanishing point R. This will be the height perspective line of the
object.
The dimensions of the object are given by the three views, and these will be
set off on measuring lines GO, EO, and OF. The measuring lines EO and
OF are drawn parallel to the vanishing trace PQ, and the measuring line
GO is drawn parallel to RQ. These measuring lines are actually the lines of
intersection of principal surfaces of the object, extended, with the picture
plane (PP). Because these lines are in the picture plane (PP), true
measurements of the object can be made along them.
Three measuring points M1, M2, and M3 are used along with the measuring
lines. To locate M1, revolve triangle CV-R-Q about RQ as an axis. Because
it is a right triangle, it can be constructed true size using R as the center and R − SP1 as the radius and drawing arc SP1 − M1, as shown. M1 is the
measuring point for the measuring line GO. Measuring points M2 and M3
are found in a similar manner.
Height dimensions, from the given views, are measured full size or to any
desired scale, along measuring line GO, at points 3, 2, and 1. From these
points, draw lines to M1. Heights on the perspective drawing are the
intersections of these lines with the perspective front corner (O) of the
object. Similarly, the true depth of the object is set off on measuring line
EO from 0 to 5, and the true width is set off on measuring line OF from 0
to 8. Construct the intermediate points in a similar manner.
16.12 Measurements in Perspective
Remember: All lines in the picture plane are shown in their true lengths,
and all lines behind the picture plane are foreshortened.
To draw the perspective of a line of telephone poles (Figure 16.12), use the
following method.16.12 Measurement of Vertical and Horizontal Lines
Use line OB, which represents the line of intersection of the picture plane
(PP) with the vertical plane containing the poles. In this line, the height AB
of a pole is measured directly to the desired scale. All the heights in the
perspective drawing of all the poles can be constructed by drawing lines
from A and B to the vanishing point (VPR).
To locate the bottoms of the poles along the line B-VPR, measure along the
picture plane (PP) the distances 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, …, equal to the distancefrom pole to pole.
Draw the lines 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, …, that form a series of isosceles triangles
0-1-1, 0-2-2, 0-3-3, …. The lines 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, …, are parallel to each
other and therefore have a common vanishing point (MP). Locate the
vanishing point by drawing from the station point (SP) a line to point T
(SP–T) parallel to the lines 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, …, and finding its piercing
point in the picture plane (PP) to use as the measuring point (MP). Because
line SP-X is parallel to the line of poles 1-2-3, …, the triangle SP-X-T is an
isosceles triangle, and T is the top view of MP. Locate point T by
measuring the distance X-T equal to SP-X or by drawing the arc SP-T with
its center at X and radius SP-X.
From the measuring point MP, find the piercing points in the picture plane
(PP) of lines 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, …, and draw their perspectives as shown.
Because these lines are horizontal lines, their piercing points are in a
horizontal ground line BZ in the picture plane at the bottom of the drawing.
The true distances between the poles can be measured along line BZ. BZ is
used as a measuring line. Use the intersections 1′, 2′, 3′, …, of the
perspectives of the lines 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, …, with the line B-VPR to provide
the spacing of the poles.
Only a few measurements may be made along the measuring line BZ that
are within the limits of the drawing. For additional measurements, you canuse the diagonal method of spacing as shown.
Because all diagonals from the bottom of each pole to the top of the
succeeding pole are parallel, they have a common vanishing point, VP1.
This information leads to using the diagonal method to make
measurements.
16.13 Direct Measurements Along Inclined Lines
The method of direct measurements may also be applied to lines inclined to
the picture plane and to the ground plane, as illustrated in Figure 16.13. It
shows line XE, which pierces the picture plane at X. If you revolve the end
of the house about a vertical axis XO into the picture plane, line XE will be
shown true length and tipped as shown at XY. This line XY may be used as
the measuring line for XE. Next find the corresponding measuring point
MP. The line YE is the horizontal base of an isosceles triangle having its
vertex at X, and a line drawn parallel to it through SP will determine MP,
as described for Figure 16.12.16.13 Measurement of Inclined Lines
Spotlight
Perspective Sketching
As you create perspective sketches, lightly blocking in the ground line,
horizon line, and vanishing point makes it easier to create a realistic
pictorial appearance and is quicker than trying to draw angles of the
receding lines through repeated trial and error.
Bear in mind that the distance between the ground line and the horizon line
alter the appearance of the view. If you select more commonly seen
placements for the ground line, horizon line, and vanishing points, your
perspectives will appear more as the subject would appear in real life.
To familiarize yourself with perspectives that look realistic, examine
existing drawings, paintings, and photographs, and practice identifying theground line, horizon line, and vanishing point.
(Courtesy of GILLIANNE TEDDER/Photolibrary.com.)
You can place a sheet of tracing paper over a photo and, using a ruler,
extend projectors from the receding lines to find the vanishing point. Or
draw directly on the photos in old newspapers that you are planning to
recycle. Eventually, you won’t need a ruler to quickly identify the vanishing
point for an image. Remember, the vanishing point may not always be on
the paper.
16.14 Vanishing Points of Inclined LinesTo find the vanishing point of an inclined line, determine the piercing point
in the picture plane (PP) of a line drawn from the station point (SP) parallel
to the given line.
Known for drawing stick figures in his “Webcomic of Romance, Sarcasm, Math and Language” xkcd
creator Randall Munroe uses perspective drawing skill in this cartoon. (Courtesy of Randall Munroe.)Figure 16.14 shows the perspective of a small building. Use this method to
determine the vanishing point of the inclined roof line C′E′.16.14 Vanishing Points of Inclined LinesA plane that passes through the station point and is parallel to the end of the
house (plan view) would intersect the picture plane (PP) in the line XY,
through VPL, and be perpendicular to the horizon.
Because the line drawn from SP parallel to C′E′ (in space) is in the plane
SP-X-Y, it will pierce the picture plane (PP) at some point T in XY. To find
the point T, revolve plane SP-X-Y about the line XY as an axis into the
picture plane (PP). The point SP will fall on the horizon at point O in the
top view and MR in the front view.
From point MR, draw the revolved position of the line SP-T (now MR-T)
making an angle of 30° with the horizon and determining point T. This
point T is the vanishing point of the line C′E′ and of all lines parallel to that
line. The vanishing point S of the line D′E′ is in line XY, because D′E′ is
in the same vertical plane as the line C′E′. Vanishing point S is as far
below the horizon as T is above the horizon, because the line E′D′ slopes
downward at the same angle at which the line C′E′ slopes upward.
16.15 Inclined Lines in Perspective, Joining Endpoint Method
The perspective drawing of inclined lines can be found without finding the
vanishing points, by finding the perspectives of the endpoints and joining
them. The perspective of any point may be determined by finding the
perspectives of any two lines intersecting at the point. Obviously, it would
be best to use horizontal lines, parallel to lines whose vanishing points arealready in the drawing. For example, in Figure 16.14, to find the
perspective of the inclined line EC, the point E′ is the intersection of the
horizontal lines R′− VPR and B′− VPL. Point C′ is already established,
because it is in the picture plane; but if it were not, it could be easily found
in the same manner. The perspective of the inclined line EC is the line
joining the perspectives of the endpoints E′ and C′.
16.16 Curves and Circles in Perspective
If a circle is parallel to the picture plane, its perspective is a circle. If the
circle is inclined to the picture plane, its perspective drawing may be any
one of the conic sections where the base of the cone is the given circle, the
vertex is the station point (SP), and the cutting plane is the picture plane
(PP). The centerline of the cone of rays is usually approximately
perpendicular to the picture plane, so the perspective will usually be an
ellipse.
The ellipse may be drawn using lines intersecting the circle, as shown in
Figure 16.15. A convenient method for determining the perspective of any
planar curve is shown in Figure 16.16.16.15 Circles in Perspective
16.16 Curves in Perspective
16.17 The Perspective Plan MethodYou can draw a perspective by first drawing the perspective of the plan of
the object (Figure 16.17a), then adding the vertical lines (Figure 16.17b),
and finally adding the connecting lines (Figure 16.17c). When the drawing
is complicated, the superimposition of the perspective on the perspective
plan causes a confusion of lines. Often, drawing the perspective of the plan
either above or below its normal location can help when you are using it to
locate the vertical measurements. One possible position of the perspective
plan is shown in Figure 16.17. The use of the perspective plan below the
perspective is shown in Figure 16.18.
16.17 Building on the Perspective Plan16.18 Perspective Plan Method
The chief advantages of the perspective plan method over the ordinary plan
method are that the vertical lines of the perspective can be spaced more
accurately and that a considerable portion of the construction can be made
above or below the perspective drawing, avoiding many confusing lines.
When the perspective plan method is used, you can omit the ordinary plan
view and measuring points that would be used to determine distances along
horizontal edges in the perspective.
16.18 Perspective Diagram
You can use drawing methods to figure out the spacing of vanishing points
and measuring points. You can also calculate the locations. In Figure 16.19,
a simple diagram of the plan layout shows the position of the object, the
picture plane, the station point, and the constructions for finding thevanishing points and measuring points for the problem in Figure 16.18. The
complete plan need not be drawn. Use a diagram drawn to any small
convenient scale. Vanishing points and measuring points should be
measured in the perspective to the larger scale desired.
16.19 Perspective Diagram
Often, structures are oriented in one of a limited number of simple positions
with reference to the picture plane, such as 30
∘ × 60
∘
, 45
∘ × 45
∘
, and 
20
∘ × 70

. You can create a table of measurements for locating vanishing
points and measuring points to avoid tedious construction of each drawing.
16.19 Shading
Shading pictorial drawings can be very effective in describing the shapes of
objects in display drawings, patent drawings, and other pictorial drawings.
Ordinary working drawings are not shaded.Because the purpose of an industrial pictorial drawing is to show the shape
clearly, the shading should be simple, should reproduce well, and should be
limited to producing a clear picture. Some of the common types of shading
are shown in Figure 16.20. Pencil or ink lines are drawn mechanically
(Figure 16.20a) or freehand (Figure 16.20b). Two methods of shading fillets
and rounds are shown in Figures 16.20c and d. Shading produced with pen
dots is shown in Figure 16.20e. Pencil “tone” shading is shown in Figure
16.20f; note that it gives poor results when copied xerographically.
16.20 Methods of Shading
Examples of line shading on pictorial drawings often used in industrial sales
literature are shown in Figures 16.21 and 16.22.16.21 Surface Shading Applied to Pictorial Drawing of Display Case16.22 A Line-Shaded Drawing of an Adjustable Support for Grinding
16.20 Computer Graphics
Perspective drawings, which provide pictorials most resembling
photographs, are the most time-consuming types of pictorials to draw by
hand. CAD programs produce either wireframe or solid perspective
representations, with user selection of viewing distance, focal point, Z-axis
convergence, and arc resolution scale. Historically, perspectives were used
more in architectural applications than in engineering drawing. Increasinglywidespread access to sophisticated CAD programs makes perspective
drawing an alternative for pictorial representations of a variety of objects.

Chapter Summary
The most realistic pictorial drawing is perspective.There are three types of perspective projection: one-point, two-point, and
three-point perspective.
In perspective projection, parallel edges converge to one or more
vanishing points, which appear similar to how the human eye sees an
object.
Perspective projection can be produced by projection from two
orthographic views (usually top and right side).
Location and relationship between the vanishing points, the picture
plane, and the object determine the appearance of the perspective view.
In one-point perspective, the object is placed so that two of the three
primary axes of the object are parallel to the picture plane.
In two-point perspective, the object is placed so that only one of the
three primary axes of the object is parallel to the picture plane.
In three-point perspective, the object is placed so that none of the three
primary axes of the object are parallel to the picture plane.

22 Running and Sliding Fits —American National Standard
RC
1
Close sliding fits are intended for the accurate location of parts which
must assemble without perceptible play.
RC
2
Sliding fits are intended for accurate location, but with greater
maximum clearance than class RC 1. Parts made to this fit move and
turn easily but are not intended to run freely, and in the larger sizes
may seize with small temperature changes.
RC
3
Precision running fits are about the closest fits which can be expected
to run freely and are intended for precision work at slow speeds and
light journal pressures, but they are not suitable where appreciable
temperature differences are likely to be encountered.
RC
4
Close running fits are intended chiefly for running fits on accurate
machinery with moderate surface speeds and journal pressures, where
accurate location and minimum play are desired.
RC
5
}Medium running fits are intended for higher running speeds, or heavy
journal pressures, or both.
RC
6
RC
7
Free running fits are intended for use where accuracy is not essential,
or where large temperature variations are likely to be encountered, or
under both these conditions.
RC

}Loose running fits are intended for use where wide commercial
tolerances may be necessary, together with an allowance, on the
aexternal member.

3 Clearance Locational Fits —American National Standard
LCLocational clearance fits are intended for parts which are normally
stationary but which can be freely assembled or disassembled. They run
from snug fits for parts requiring accuracy of location, through the
medium clearance fits for parts such as spigots, to the looser fastener
fits, where freedom of assembly is of prime importance.

5 Interference Locational Fits —American National Standard
LNLocational interference fits are used where accuracy of location is of
prime importance and for parts requiring rigidity and alignment with no
special requirements for bore pressure. Such fits are not intended for
parts designed to transmit frictional loads from one part to another by
virtue of the tightness of fit, as these conditions are covered by force
fits.
Basic hole system. Limits are in thousandths of an inch. Limits for hole
and shaft are applied algebraically to the basic size to obtain the limits of
size for the parts. Data in boldface are in accordance with ABC
agreements. Symbols H7, p6, etc., are hole and shaft designations used in
ABC System.

6 Force and Shrink Fits —American National Standard
FN Light drive fits are those requiring light assembly pressures, and
a
a1 produce more or less permanent assemblies. They are suitable for thin
sections or long fits, or in cast-iron external members.
FN
2
Medium drive fits are suitable for ordinary steel parts, or for shrink fits
on light sections. They are about the tightest fits that can be used with
high-grade cast-iron external members.
FN
3
Heavy drive fits are suitable for heavier steel parts or for shrink fits in
medium sections.
FN

FN
5
}Force fits are suitable for parts which can be highly stressed, or for
shrink fits where the heavy pressing forces required are impractical.

34 Types of Scales
Scales are measuring tools used to quickly enlarge or reduce drawing
measurements. Figure A34.1 shows a number of scales, including (a)
metric, (b) engineers’, (c) decimal, (d) mechanical engineers’, and (e)
architects’ scales. On a full-divided scale, the basic units are subdivided
throughout the length of the scale. On open-divided scales, such as the
architects’ scale, only the end unit is subdivided.
Scales are usually made of plastic or boxwood. The better wood scales have
white plastic edges. Scales can be either triangular or flat. The triangular
scales combine several scales on one stick by using each of the triangle’s
three sides. A scale guard, shown in Figure A34.1f, can save time and
prevent errors by indicating the side of the scale currently in use.
†
aA34.1 Types of Scales
Several scales that are based on the inch-foot system of measurement
continue in domestic use today, along with the metric system of
measurement, which is accepted worldwide for science, technology, and
international trade.
Metric ScalesMetric scales are available in flat and triangular styles with a variety of
scale graduations. The triangular scale illustrated (Figure A34.2) has one
full-size scale and five reduced-size scales, all fully divided. With these
scales, a drawing can be made full size, enlarged sized, or reduced sized.
Full Size The 1:1 scale (Figure A34.2a, top) is full size, and each division is
actually 1 mm in width with the calibrations numbered at 10-mm intervals.
The same scale is also convenient for ratios of 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, and so
on.
Half Size The 1:2 scale (Figure A34.2a, bottom) is half size, and each
division equals 2 mm with the calibration numbering at 20-unit intervals.
This scale is also convenient for ratios of 1:20, 1:200, 1:2000, and so on.
The remaining four scales on this triangular metric scale include the typical
scale ratios of 1:5, 1:25, and 1:75 (Figure A34.2b and c). These ratios may
also be enlarged or reduced by multiplying or dividing by a factor of 10.
Metric scales are also available with other scale ratios for specific drawing
purposes.
Metric scales are also used in map drawing and in drawing force diagrams
or other graphical constructions that involve such scales as 1mm = 1kg
and 1mm = 500kg.A34.2 Metric Scales
Engineers’ Scales
An engineers’ scale is a decimal scale graduated in units of 1 inch divided
into 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 parts. These scales are also frequently called
civil engineers’ scales because they were originally used in civil
engineering to draw large-scale structures or maps. Sometimes theengineers’ scale is referred to as a chain scale, because it derived from a
chain of 100 links that surveyors used for land measurements.
Because the engineers’ scale divides inches into decimal units, it is
convenient in machine drawing to set off inch dimensions expressed in
decimals. For example, to set off 1.650′′ full size, use the 10 scale and
simply set off one main division plus 6-1/2 subdivisions (Figure A34.3). To
set off the same dimension half size, use the 20 scale, since the 20 scale is
exactly half the size of the 10 scale. Similarly, to set off the dimension
quarter size, use the 40 scale.
A34.3 Engineers’ Scale
An engineers’ scale is also used in drawing stress diagrams or other
graphical constructions to such scales as 1′′= 20lb and 1′′= 4000lb.
Decimal-Inch Scales
The widespread use of decimal-inch dimensions brought about a scale
specifically for that use. On its full-size scale, each inch is divided into
fiftieths of an inch, or .02′′. On half- and quarter-size decimal scales, the
inches are compressed to half size or quarter size and then are divided into
10 parts, so that each subdivision stands for .1′′ (Figure A34.4).A34.4 Decimal-Inch Scale
Mechanical Engineers’ Scales
The objects represented in machine drawing vary in size from small parts
that measure only fractions of an inch to parts of large dimensions. For this
reason, mechanical engineers’ scales are divided into units representing
inches to full size, half size, quarter size, or eighth size (Figure A34.5). To
draw an object to a scale of half size, for example, use the mechanical
engineers’ scale marked half size, which is graduated so that every 1/2
′′
represents 1′′. In other words, the half-size scale is simply a full-size scale
compressed to half size.
A34.5 Mechanical Engineers’ Scale
These scales are useful in dividing dimensions. For example, to draw a 3.6′′
-diameter circle full size, it is necessary to use half of 3.6′′ as the radius.
Instead of using math to find half of 3.6′′, it is easier to set off 3.6′′ on the
half-size scale.Tip
Triangular combination scales are available that include full- and half-size
mechanical engineers’ scales, several architects’ scales, and an engineers’
scale all on one stick.
35 Additional Geometric Constructions
Drawing an Approximate Ellipse
For many purposes, particularly where a small ellipse is required, use the
approximate circular arc method (Figure A35.1). Such an ellipse is sure to
be symmetrical and is quick to draw.
A35.1 Drawing an Approximate Ellipse
Given axes AB and CD,
Step 1. Draw line AC. With O as center and OA as radius, draw the arc AE.
With C as center and CE as radius, draw the arc EF.Step 2. Draw perpendicular bisector GH of the line AF; the points K and J,
where they intersect the axes, are centers of the required arcs.
Step 3. Find centers M and L by setting off OL = OK and OM = OJ.
Using centers K, L, M, and J, draw circular arcs as shown. The points of
tangency T are at the junctures of the arcs on the lines joining the centers.
Tip
An ordinary piece of solder wire can be used very successfully by bending
the wire to the desired curve.
First, lightly sketch a curve through the points you have determined. Then,
match the irregular curve along your lightly sketched pencil line for some
distance beyond the segment to be drawn. This aids in creating curve
portions that blend smoothly together at their tangencies. Try to avoid
drawing below the curve.Drawing Irregular Curves
Drawing a Parabola
The curve of intersection between a right circular cone and a plane parallel
to one of its elements is a parabola (see Figure A35.2d). The parabola is
used to reflect surfaces for light and sound, for vertical curves in highways,
for forms of arches, and approximately for forms of the curves of cables for
suspension bridges. It is also used to show the bending moment at any point
on a uniformly loaded beam or girder.A35.2 Conic Sections
A parabola is generated by a point moving so that its distances from a fixed
point, the focus, and from a fixed line, the directrix, remain equal.
Focus F and directrix AB are given. A parabola may be generated by a
pencil guided by a string (Figure A35.3a). Fasten the string at F and C; its
length is GC. The point C is selected at random; its distance from G
depends on the desired extent of the curve. Keep the string taut and the
pencil against the T-square, as shown.
Given focus F and directrix AB, draw a line DE parallel to the directrix and
at any distance CZ from it (Figure A35.3b). With center at F and radius CZ,
draw arcs to intersect line DE at the points Q and R, which are points on the
parabola. Determine as many additional points as are necessary to draw the
parabola accurately, by drawing additional lines parallel to line AB and
proceeding in the same manner.
A tangent to the parabola at any point G bisects the angle formed by the
focal line FG and the line SG perpendicular to the directrix.Given the rise and span of the parabola (Figure A35.3c), divide AO into any
number of equal parts, and divide AD into a number of equal parts
amounting to the square of that number. From line AB, each point on the
parabola is offset by a number of units equal to the square of the number of
units from point O. For example, point 3 projects 9 units (the square of 3).
This method is generally used for drawing parabolic arches.
To find the focus, F, given points P, R, and V of a parabola (Figure A35.3d),
draw a tangent at P, making a = b. Draw the perpendicular bisector of AP,
which intersects the axis at F, the focus of the parabola.A35.3 Drawing a Parabola
Draw a parabola given rectangle or parallelogram ABCD (Figure A35.4a
and b). Divide BC into any even number of equal parts, divide the sides AB
and DC each into half as many parts, and draw lines as shown. The
intersections of likenumbered lines are points on the parabola.A35.4 Drawing a Parabola
Joining Two Points by a Parabolic Curve
Let X and Y be the given points (Figure A35.5). Assume any point O, and
draw tangents XO and YO. Divide XO and YO into the same number of
equal parts, number the division points as shown, and connect
corresponding points. These lines are tangents of the required parabola and
form its envelope. Sketch a light smooth curve, and then darken the curve
with the aid of an irregular curve.A35.5 Parabolic Curves
These parabolic curves are more pleasing in appearance than circular arcs
and are useful in machine design. If the tangents OX and OY are equal, the
axis of the parabola will bisect the angle between them.
Tip
Irregular Curves
The curves are largely successive segments of geometric curves, such as
the ellipse, parabola, hyperbola, and involute. Among the many special
types of curves available are hyperbolas, parabolas, ellipses, logarithmic
spirals, ship curves, and railroad curves. Adjustable curves consist of a
core of lead, enclosed by a coil spring attached to a flexible strip. The
figure shows a spline to which “ducks” (weights) are attached. The spline
can be bent to form any desired curve, limited by the elasticity of the
material.Irregular or French curves are available in a wide variety of sizes and shapes
Adjustable CurvesUsing the Irregular Curves
Drawing a Hyperbola
The curve of intersection between a right circular cone and a plane making
an angle with the axis smaller than that made by the elements is a hyperbola
(see Figure A35.2e). A hyperbola is generated by a point moving so that the
difference of its distances from two fixed points, the foci, is constant and
equal to the transverse axis of the hyperbola.
Let F and F′ be the foci and AB the transverse axis (Figure A35.6a). The
curve may be generated by a pencil guided by a string, as shown. Fasten astring at F′ and C; its length is FC minus AB. The point C is chosen at
random; its distance from F depends on the desired extent of the curve.
Fasten the straightedge at F. If it is revolved about F, with the pencil point
moving against it and with the string taut, the hyperbola may be drawn as
shown.
To construct the curve geometrically, select any point X on the transverse
axis produced (Figure A35.6b). With centers at F and F′ and BX as radius,
draw the arcs DE. With the same centers, F and F′, and AX as radius, draw
arcs to intersect the arcs first drawn through the points Q, R, S, and T,
which are points of the required hyperbola. Find as many additional points
as are necessary to draw the curves accurately by selecting other points
similar to point X along the transverse axis and proceeding as described for
point X.A35.6 Drawing a Hyperbola
To draw the tangent to a hyperbola at a given point P, bisect the angle
between the focal radii FP and F′P. The bisector is the required tangent.
To draw the asymptotes HCH of the hyperbola, draw a circle with the
diameter FF′ and draw perpendiculars to the transverse axis at points A and
B to intersect the circle at points H. The lines HCH are the required
asymptotes.
Drawing an Equilateral Hyperbola
Asymptotes OB and OA, at right angles to each other, and point P on the
curve are given (Figure A35.7).
In an equilateral hyperbola, the asymptotes, which are at right angles to
each other, may be used as the axes to which the curve is referred. If a
chord of the hyperbola is extended to intersect the axes, the intercepts
between the curve and the axes are equal (Figure A35.7a). For example, a
chord through given point P intersects the axes at points 1 and 2, intercepts 
P − 1 and 2–3 are equal, and point 3 is a point on the hyperbola. Likewise,
another chord through P provides equal intercepts P − 1′ and 3′−2′, and
point 3′ is a point on the curve. Not all chords need be drawn through given
point P, but as new points are established on the curve, chords may be
drawn through them to obtain more points. After finding enough points toensure an accurate curve, draw the hyperbola with the aid of an irregular
curve.
In an equilateral hyperbola, the coordinates are related, so their products
remain constant. Through given point P, draw lines 1–P–Y and 2–P–Z
parallel, respectively, to the axes (Figure A35.7b). From coordinate O, draw
any diagonal intersecting these two lines at points 3 and X. At these points
draw lines parallel to the axes, intersecting at point 4, a point on the curve.
Likewise, another diagonal from O intersects the two lines through P at
points 8 and Y, and lines through these points parallel to the axes intersect
at point 9, another point on the curve. A third diagonal similarly produces
point 10 on the curve, and so on. Find as many points as necessary for a
smooth curve, and draw the hyperbola with the aid of an irregular curve.
From the similar triangles O–X–5 and O–3–2, it is evident that lines 
P − 1 × P − 2 = 4 − 5 × 4 − 6.A35.7 Equilateral Hyperbola
The equilateral hyperbola can be used to represent varying pressure of a gas
as the volume varies, because the pressure varies inversely with the volume;
that is, pressure × volume is constant.
Drawing a Spiral of Archimedes
To find points on the curve, draw lines through the pole C, making equal
angles with each other, such as 30° angles (Figure A35.8). Beginning with
any one line, set off any distance, such as 2 mm or 1/16′′, set off twice that
distance on the next line, three times on the third, and so on. Use an
irregular curve to draw a smooth curve.A35.8 Spiral of Archimedes
Drawing a Helix
A helix is generated by a point moving around and along the surface of a
cylinder or cone with a uniform angular velocity and a uniform linear
velocity about the axis, and with a uniform velocity in the direction of the
axis (Figure A35.9). A cylindrical helix is simply known as a helix. The
distance measured parallel to the axis traversed by the point in one
revolution is called the lead.
If the cylindrical surface on which a helix is generated is rolled out onto a
plane, the helix becomes a straight line (Figure A35.9a). The portion below
the helix becomes a right triangle, the altitude of which is equal to the lead
of the helix; the length of the base is equal to the circumference of the
cylinder. Such a helix can be defined as the shortest line that can be drawn
on the surface of a cylinder connecting two points not on the same element.To draw the helix, draw two views of the cylinder on which the helix is
generated (Figure A35.9b). Divide the circle of the base into any number of
equal parts. On the rectangular view of the cylinder, set off the lead and
divide it into the same number of equal parts as the base. Number the
divisions as shown (in this case 16). When the generating point has moved
one sixteenth of the distance around the cylinder, it will have risen one
sixteenth of the lead; when it has moved halfway around the cylinder, it will
have risen half the lead; and so on. Points on the helix are found by
projecting up from point 1 in the circular view to line 1 in the rectangular
view, from point 2 in the circular view to line 2 in the rectangular view, and
so on.
Figure A35.9b is a right-handed helix. In a left-handed helix (Figure
A35.9c), the visible portions of the curve are inclined in the opposite
direction—that is, downward to the right. The helix shown in Figure
A35.9b can be converted into a left-handed helix by interchanging the
visible and hidden lines.
The helix is used in industry, as in screw threads, worm gears, conveyors,
spiral stairways, and so on. The stripes of a barber pole are helical in form.
The construction for a right-handed conical helix is shown in Figure
A35.9d.A35.9 Helix
Drawing an Involute
An involute is the path of a point on a string as the string unwinds from a
line, polygon, or circle.
To Draw an Involute of a Line Let AB be the given line. With AB as
radius and B as center, draw the semicircle AC (Figure A35.10a). With AC
as radius and A as center, draw the semicircle CD. With BD as radius and B
as center, draw the semicircle DE. Continue similarly, alternating centers
between A and B, until the figure is completed.
To Draw an Involute of a Triangle Let ABC be the given triangle. With
CA as radius and C as center, draw arc AD (Figure A35.10b). With BD as
radius and B as center, draw arc DE. With AE as radius and A as center,
draw arc EF. Continue similarly until the figure is completed.
To Draw an Involute of a Square Let ABCD be the given square. With
DA as radius and D as center, draw the 90° arc AE (Figure A35.10c).Proceed as for the involute of a triangle until the figure is completed.
To Draw an Involute of a Circle A circle may be considered a polygon
with an infinite number of sides (Figure A35.10d). The involute is
constructed by dividing the circumference into a number of equal parts,
drawing a tangent at each division point, setting off along each tangent the
length of the corresponding circular arc (Figure A35.10c), and drawing the
required curve through the points set off on the several tangents.
An involute can be generated by a point on a straight line that is rolled on a
fixed circle (Figure A35.10e). Points on the required curve may be
determined by setting off equal distances 0–1, 1–2, 2–3, and so on, along
the circumference, drawing a tangent at each division point, and proceeding
as explained for Figure A35.10d.
A35.10 Involutes
The involute of a circle is used in the construction of involute gear teeth. In
this system, the involute forms the face and a part of the flank of the teeth
of gear wheels; the outlines of the teeth of racks are straight lines.
Drawing a CycloidA cycloid is generated by a point P on the circumference of a circle that
rolls along a straight line (Figure A35.11).
Given the generating circle and the straight line AB tangent to it, make both
distances CA and CB equal to the semicircumference of the circle (see
Figure A35.11). Divide these distances and the semicircumference into the
same number of equal parts (six, for instance) and number them
consecutively, as shown. Suppose the circle rolls to the left; when point 1 of
the circle reaches point 1′ of the line, the center of the circle will be at D,
point 7 will be the highest point of the circle, and the generating point 6 will
be at the same distance from line AB as point 5 is when the circle is in its
central position. To find point P′, draw a line through point 5 parallel to AB
and intersect it with an arc drawn from the center D with a radius equal to
that of the circle. To find point P′′, draw a line through point 4 parallel to
AB, and intersect it with an arc drawn from the center E, with a radius equal
to that of the circle. Points J, K, and L are found in a similar way.
Another method is shown in the right half of Figure A35.11. With the center
at 11′ and the chord 11–6 as radius, draw an arc. With 10′ as center and the
chord 10–6 as radius, draw an arc. Continue similarly with centers 9′, 8′,
and 7′. Draw the required cycloid tangent to these arcs.A35.11 Cycloid
Either method may be used; however, the second is shorter. The line joining
the generating point and the point of contact for the generating circle is a
normal of the cycloid. The lines 1′−P′ and 2′−P′′, for instance, are
normals; this property makes the cycloid suitable for the outlines of gear
teeth.
Drawing an Epicycloid or a Hypocycloid
If the generating point P is on the circumference of a circle that rolls along
the convex side of a larger circle, the curve generated is an epicycloid
(Figure A35.12a). If the circle rolls along the concave side of a larger circle,
the curve generated is a hypocycloid (Figure A35.12b). These curves are
drawn in much the same way as the cycloid (Figure A35.11). Like cycloids,
these curves are used to form the outlines of certain gear teeth and are
therefore of practical importance in machine design.A35.12 Epicycloid and HypocycloidIndex

Make copies of these pages to use for additional practice.
Worksheet 25 Practice Identifying SurfacesThe puzzling shape below, though not likely to occur in a real-world design,
was developed especially to exercise your visualization skills. Use the hints
provided to identify the surfaces in the top view and label them on the right￾side view. In two cases, you will label both a visible and a hidden surface
on the same edge surface shown as a line in the right-side view. You may
refer to the illustration below to check your work.
Start with the surface in the top view that is closest to the right-side view
and find the corresponding surface in the side view. Do you see its shape in
the side view, or is it on edge? Look for a drawing line that has the correct
projected depth. (Surface K has been labeled for you.)
Now, examine the next surface back on the top view. You can project lines
to check its depth. If more than one edge in the side view lines up correctly
with a surface, use visibility to decide which is closer. (If a closer surface is
higher in the side view, the further surface is hidden.)
Use connecting “steps” as clues. Surfaces that connect in one view will also
connect in any other view. Remember, two adjacent surfaces in the same
view cannot lie in the same plane on the object (or they would be the same
surface).Make copies of these pages to use for additional practice.
Worksheet 26 Complete the View and Identify SurfacesDraw light lines from the vertices in the top view to help you locate and
label the identified surfaces in the front view. Draw in the four lines that are
missing from the front view. Assume cuts go all the way through unless
otherwise shown. Portions may be hidden or visible. (Surfaces A, B, and C
are labeled for you.)Make copies of these pages to use for additional practice.Worksheet 27 Draw Surfaces in a Front View
Here is another shape that would be unlikely in real-world design. This sort
of puzzle can help you improve your visualization skills. Draw light lines
from the vertices in the top view to help you identify and label the surfaces
in the front view. Add the five lines missing to the front view and shade in
surface K. (Surfaces B and F are labeled for you.)Make copies of these pages to use for additional practice.

Worksheet 30 Sketching a Full Section
Sketch the right-side view as a full section. The cutting plane has been
shown, although in this case it is not necessary. Use the grid to help create
thin hatch lines at an angle of 45° by drawing through the diagonals. Show
hatching on the solid portions of the object cut through by the cutting plane.
The left-side view is shown as your reference for the features you will
sketch in the section.Make copies of these pages to use for additional practice.
Worksheet 31 Sketching a Half Section
Add the right-side view as a half section. Be sure to use a centerline to
divide the sectioned and unsectioned halves. Notice the way the cutting
plane is offset to pass through the hole. Keep in mind the practices for
sectioning ribs and webs. The left-side view is shown as a reference.Make copies of these pages to use for additional practice.
Worksheet 32 Creating an Aligned Section
Sketch an aligned section for the right-side view. Notice that in the left-side
view the holes are shown revolved onto the vertical centerline. The left-side
view is shown as a reference.Make copies of these pages to use for additional practice.
Worksheet 33 The Auxiliary View Glass Box
Cut out the paper representation of a glass box with an auxiliary viewing
plane shown below.
Neatly letter the names “horizontal plane,” “frontal plane,” and “auxiliary
plane” on the appropriate planes. Label the viewing planes with the
principal dimensions that will show in each view. (For example, the front
view will show the height and width of an object placed inside the box.)
Project an auxiliary view of the object shown pictorially at the upper right
from the two views shown.Fold on the folding lines and use a small piece of tape to join the top and
auxiliary viewing planes. Then use the box to help you answer the questions
at right.
1. Why must the depth dimension be the same in the top view as in the
auxiliary view?
2. Why can you draw projection lines between the front view and the
auxiliary view?
3. Could this box have been cut and folded in a different way so that you
could project from the top view?
4. How many other auxiliary viewing planes could you construct that
would show the depth dimension?
5. Would this particular box show a true-size auxiliary view for all objects?Make copies of these pages to use for additional practice.
Worksheet 34 Plotting CurvesThe auxiliary view shows the true size and shape of an inclined cut through
a piece of molding. The method of plotting points is similar to that
explained for the ellipse.
1. Identify some points along the curve shown in the side view. This step
has been completed for you.
2. Locate those same points in the front view. The curved shape is the
inclined surface.
3. Project the points into the auxiliary view. The reference plane has been
located for you and a few points have been projected.
4. Finish projecting all of the points on the inclined surface and draw its
true shape in the auxiliary view.Make copies of these pages to use for additional practice.
