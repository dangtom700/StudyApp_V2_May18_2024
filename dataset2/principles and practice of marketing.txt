Preface
Welcome to the landmark 10th edition of Principles and Practice of Marketing, in which we
explore together how marketing has a profound effect on the way we live, communicate and
trade, find out what this means for individuals, business and communities, and discover the
implications for how firms and organizations operate. Marketing is constantly adapting to meet
the demands of dynamic business environments, and exploring both theoretical principles and
business practices is the key to understanding this highly dynamic and complex subject.
Developing the 10th edition
The 1st edition was published in 1995, when marketing textbooks were not generally written
from a European perspective. David had a vision to publish a book that explained the
principles of contemporary marketing, supported by vivid practitioner examples from local
markets, aiming to inspire, motivate and strengthen students’ understanding of marketing–
guiding principles that have remained true throughout and informed the writing of every
subsequent edition, including the 10th.
Writing this edition has been more than usually challenging, as many disruptive, unsettling
and disturbing transformations have occurred in the marketing environment since the previous
edition. Brexit has disrupted trade, legal issues and much more between the UK and EU
countries; the Covid-19 pandemic has unsettled individuals, firms, nations, society and global
economies; climate change has and continues to significantly disturb established trade
practices; and environmental targets such as reducing carbon emissions, waste and pollution
are leading to redefined brand images and altered values; finally, digital and technology
innovations, from augmented reality and artificial intelligence to electronic vehicles, are
reconfiguring marketing landscapes and transforming business opportunities.
Why use this book to study marketing?
This book aims to help you to learn, understand and master the subject, as well as teach and
inform future marketers by:
Engaging learners
This book aims to be best-in-class in finding new ways to engage the modern learner, by
making the subject of marketing accessible using topical and contemporary marketing
practices to illustrate and demonstrate theories, frameworks and concepts. By understanding
how to interpret marketing and its environments, and apply knowledge tactically andpage xviii
strategically, students gain a richer knowledge of the value of the subject, build confidence into
their understanding and benefit from developing their expertise through a comprehensive
marketing education.
The book provides a logical and coherent framework for understanding important topics
such as digital marketing, consumer behaviour, B2B marketing, segmentation, targeting and
positioning, brand building, innovation, pricing, communications, marketing strategy and
implementation. These core subject areas form the backbone of marketing education.
It will help you develop skills that will enable you to identify the opportunities and pitfalls of
applying marketing tools and techniques, to develop the insights needed not only to become a
successful marketer but also an accomplished student.
Organized for learning
This 10th edition is designed to enable your knowledge of marketing to grow. We designed the
book for ease of use. Ideas, theories and concepts are explained in each chapter, and there
are many examples to bring these aspects to life. Marketing in Action vignettes explore some
of the latest applications of marketing.
Part 1 explores marketing fundamentals: the principles of how marketing works; the forces
that shape marketing practices and the environment in which firms trade; the customer–who
they are and how they behave; how to create value and build lasting relationships; developing
understanding of marketing through analytics and customer insights.
Part 2 examines value creation, which is at the heart of modern marketing, from the
perspectives of brands, innovation, pricing and services.
Part 3 concentrates on how marketers communicate in the digital age, and how goods and
services are delivered. You will discover how advertising, digital marketing, direct marketing,
social media and personal selling are applied to achieve marketing goals, and learn about the
importance of distribution and multichannel management.
Part 4 focuses on the strategic elements of marketing: marketing planning and strategy,
and how to create sustainable competitive advantage. By the time you reach this final section,
you should have developed a comprehensive knowledge.
The chapters also include Marketing in Action vignettes and Mini Cases that ask you to
apply the principles you have learned to real-world scenarios. The case studies at the end of
each chapter provide more in-depth examples. These features will not only help you to absorb
the key principles of marketing but will also allow you to make links between the various topics
and demonstrate the marketing mix at work in real-life situations.
Other learning aids, in the form of exercises and questions at the end of each chapter, help
you check your understanding of new concepts. There are recommended readings, so you
can stretch your knowledge further. You can also test your understanding and expand your
knowledge by exploring the resources in Connect™.
Supporting the instructorpage xix
Be at the forefront: Marketing cannot be fully grasped without solid examples of how theories
apply in practice. That is why in every chapter you will find a wealth of examples to support the
theoretical concepts, models and frameworks presented. Use the latest theoretical marketing
thinking, and apply the new vignettes, case studies and illustrations throughout the book to
illuminate each subject area.
A comprehensive educational resource: Principles and Practice of Marketing is more
than a textbook–through a suite of digital learning tools and teaching resources it supports
transitional learning:
by providing coherent stories around each marketing subject, which engage and illuminate
signposting routes through topical, challenging and complex marketing topics
with resources to support the delivery of memorable learning experiences to engage the
modern student, enabling them to gain knowledge, apply marketing ideas and develop
critical thinking skills.
New for the 10th edition
Recent events and contemporary issues are featured throughout, but there further exciting
new developments in this edition.
New content: in response to reviewers’ feedback there are new examples of digital
marketing, EDI and sustainability in the form of Mini Cases, Marketing in Action vignettes,
Hidden Gems and extended case studies. Stimulating examples enable discussion and
provoke debate. For example, discover whether home working and electric vehicles are
good for the planet; evaluate how digital customer insights are driving marketing but
causing ethical challenges over data and privacy; consider how Gucci and L’Oréal have
become leaders in the use of digital technology in the luxury fashion and beauty industries,
and what these cases mean for the future of marketing.
New feature: Hidden Gems showcase firms doing things differently and reveal how SMEs
are shaping marketing as well as large corporate brands. Each Hidden Gem has its own
revealing story and digital credentials. Pangaia, for example, is saving the planet with
clothes and technology; Darktrace is hiding in plain sight, protecting its customers with
cyber security; Alpro is delivering plant power on a large scale; and Tobii is watching
consumer behaviour using attention computing. These new up-to-the-minute gems appear
in each chapter.
New chapter: Chapter 3 Sustainable Marketing and Society focuses on how the
environment and society are changing the marketing landscape, discusses the
implications of sustainability for marketing theory and practice, and considers how to
create value through practical sustainable approaches to marketing. Examples and
features emphasize the growing importance of this area of study, and bring into question
many traditional marketing practices.
New beginnings and new endings: we have redesigned the chapter openings to
highlight the important learning outcomes, making it clear what you will be able to achieve
having read the chapter. At the end of each chapter, the Big Picture feature acts as an
aide-memoire, highlighting key topics, while the Detailed Review expands on this to
provide concise summaries of what is learned in each chapter.
Research updated: latest studies in the field of marketing bring new insights,
building on seminal works that set out the very foundations of marketing
education presented in earlier editions of Principles and Practice of Marketing, and
introducing new thinking on many areas of marketing, including new models of
sustainability and digital marketing.Exciting new in-depth cases: the cases at the end of each chapter showcase real-world
marketing and tackle challenging issues facing brands trading in dynamic markets. Here
are just a few to invite you into the fast-moving world of marketing:
Netflix, using big data to succeed against hot competition
BrewDog, a brand built on attitude, crowdfunding its way to becoming the world’s most
sustainable beer
Anthon Berg’s SWOT analysis sets out the plan for a global future for this luxury
Scandinavian chocolate brand
singer-songwriter Billie Eilish is leveraging personal anti-branding online, showing how
consistent messaging creates a marketing tour de force
Dr Marten’s boot rebellion is revitalizing the UK brand, embracing digital to grow its

by producing food with integrity.
Each case progresses ideas and concepts explored in the chapter.
New package of supporting online resources: including a rich choice of activities
designed to help students develop and apply their understanding of marketing concepts.
See pages xxii–xxv for further details.
We hope you will all enjoy this book, and it adds to your knowledge, understanding and
expertise in the subject of marketing.

Introduction to Principles and Practice
of Marketing
The principles of marketing have been influencing business practices for
centuries, but the history of marketing as a distinct discipline can be traced
back to the beginning of the 1990s (Sheth and Parvatiyar 1995). Since then,
marketing has developed into a guiding philosophy for firms of every shape,size and type. Theodore Levitt said, ‘Management must think of itself not as
producing products, but as providing customer-creating value satisfactions’
(Levitt 1960), putting the customer at the heart of marketing. While customers’
needs and wants change, marketing practices also change to reflect and
accommodate new customer demands, trends and changing values. The
authors of this book recognize the importance of reflecting such developments
and the shift in marketing teaching, and the focus of this new edition has
changed accordingly. While the marketing mix (product, price, promotion and
place) and the service mix (people, process and physical evidence) remain core
elements, relationship marketing, value creation and other newer approaches
like digital marketing are now also featured.
The text is structured around four key dimensions of marketing:
Part 1: Fundamentals of Marketing–seven chapters exploring the essential
elements of marketing
Part 2: Creating Customer Value–four chapters focusing on key elements of
delivering customer value
Part 3: Communicating and Delivering Customer Value–five chapters
concentrating on communications and distribution
Part 4: Marketing Planning and Strategy–five chapters that adopt a more
strategic focus on marketing.
This structure is illustrated in Figure 1.1.
FIGURE 1.1
Overviewpage 5
This chapter sets out the foundations for developing your understanding of
the principles and practice of marketing, beginning with the fundamental
question: ‘What is marketing?’
What is Marketing?Marketing drives successful organizations, but it is often misinterpreted and
sometimes gets a bad press. Critics use words like marketing ‘gimmicks’,
‘ploys’ and ‘tricks’, which undermine the valuable effect marketing can
deliver. This is unfortunate because the essence of marketing is value creation
not trickery. Successful companies rely on customers returning to repurchase,
and the goal of marketing is to facilitate this through creating long-term
satisfaction not short-term deception. Marketing is a form of exchange, which
is the act or process of receiving something and giving something in return.
The something could be a physical good, a service, an idea, information or
money. Money facilitates exchanges so people can concentrate on working at
things they are good at, earn money (itself an exchange), and spend it on
products or services someone else has supplied. The objective is for all parties
in the exchange to feel satisfied and gain something of value. This is
particularly important because satisfied customers are more likely than
dissatisfied ones to return for more. Hence the notion of customer satisfaction
as the central pillar of marketing is fundamental to the creation of a stream of
exchanges upon which organizational success depends.
This marketing theme, which remains important, is reinforced by the
writings of top management consultant, the late Peter Drucker, who stated
(Drucker 1999):
‘Because the purpose of business is to create and keep customers, it has
only two central functions–marketing and innovation. The basic
function of marketing is to attract and retain customers at a profit.’
What can we learn from this statement?
First, it places marketing in a central role for business success, and focuses
managers’ attention on attracting and keeping customers.
Second, it implies that the purpose of marketing is not to chase any
customer at any price. Drucker used profit as a criterion. Please note that
profit may be used by many commercial organizations as a measure of success,
whereas in the non-profit sector other measures, such as reduction of social
deprivation or hunger, are equally important as profit. Consequently, the
concepts, principles and techniques described in this book are equally
applicable to global corporations (e.g. Apple Inc., Royal Dutch Shell, BMW,
AXA Insurance) and charitable organizations, such as WWF (protecting
natural habitats), Wellcome Trust (working to use science to solve globalpage 6
health challenges), INGKA Foundation (committed to helping families and
children out of poverty).
Third, the investment required to attract new customers is greater than the
amount needed to retain existing ones. Indeed, the costs of attracting a new
customer have been found to be up to six times the costs of retaining current
ones (Rosenberg and Czepeil 1983). Companies that apply the principles of
marketing recognize the importance of building relationships with customers
by providing satisfaction, and attracting new customers by creating added
value. Grönroos (1989) stressed the importance of relationship-building in his
definition of marketing, in which he describes the objective of marketing as to
establish, develop and commercialize long-term customer relationships so that
the objectives of the parties involved are met.
Fourth, most markets (e.g. consumer, industrial, not-for-profit) are
characterized by strong competition. This means that organizations need not
only to understand what their customers want, but also what their competitors
provide. If an organization does not meet its customers’ needs, they may
switch to a rival supplier.
Finally, you should consider how the practices of marketing are applied by
organizations in dynamic and changing marketplaces. Since 2000, the growth
of the digital economy has significantly increased opportunities to gather,
analyse and exploit customer data, and has influenced how we trade in both the
physical and digital worlds. In 2004, the rise of social media began to
influence how we behave, interact and communicate. In 2008, the sharing
economy started to change our views on how to buy and use things, such as
accommodation (e.g. Airbnb-sharing our homes) and ride-sharing (Uber, Lyft).
In 2010, the gig economy changed attitudes to how we work. But it’s not just
digital technology that is changing the marketing environment: in 2020, the
Covid-19 pandemic impacted organizations in profound ways, causing them to
completely rethink their business models. Climate is another force for change.

Moving Mountains Ups the Game for Vegan FoodBrands
Simeon Van der Molen was running a business selling eco cleaning products when his
doctor identified he had a problem with high cholesterol. Simeon faced a choice: change his
diet, cutting out meat and dairy products, or take medication for the rest of his life. This was
a life-changing moment. He started searching supermarkets for vegetarian options, but the
products he bought did not delight his taste buds. So this sustainability-driven entrepreneur
decided to create a new brand of meat and fish plant-based alternatives, Moving Mountains
Foods. The company seeks to ‘enhance human health, reduce intensive factory farming,
improve food sustainability, and increase animal welfare’ (Moving Mountains 2022). The
‘bleeding’ burger was the first product developed by food technologists. Simeon wanted a
product that was akin to meat, that looked, tasted and responded in the same way as a real
meat burger. The burger was rapidly adopted and has become highly successful, with an
established international customer base including chain and independent restaurants, such
as Hard Rock Café, Applebee’s and Carl’s Jr., and supermarkets such as Sainsbury’s,
Waitrose and Ocado (UK).

The future looks bright for Moving Mountains as, globally, the alternative-to-meat market is
a growing sector predicted to be worth more than $7 billion by 2025, which is creating
opportunities for vegan businesses and brands. The brand continues to expand its ranges,
with plant-based fish options, meatballs and more. There are many new companies entering
this market so, to keep ahead of the competition, Moving Mountains is constantly looking for
ways to communicate and connect with customers. Recently, it launched a social media
campaign that saw it join with universities to reach students and get the message across
about vegan foods. It has also partnered with One Planet Pizza in a UK challenge to find
the nation’s favourite alternative pizza.

These learning points are referred to throughout the book in a variety of
contexts. The rest of this chapter introduces the key principles of the
marketing concept, explores how marketing can create and deliver customer
value and satisfaction, and considers the role of marketing planning and
strategy.
The marketing concept
The traditional view of the marketing concept is based on the premise that
companies achieve their profit and other objectives by satisfying (even
delighting) customers (Houston 1986). However, modern marketing also needs
to consider another fundamental aspect of trading exchanges: competition. In
other words, the traditional marketing concept is a necessary but insufficient
condition for organizational and corporate success. To achieve success,
companies must go further than mere customer satisfaction; they must do
better than the competition if they are to thrive and grow. International Airlines
Group (IAG) is one of the world’s largest airline groups, which provides
national and international flights. It aims to meet the needs of its different
customers by maximizing choice. Brands include: British Airways (BA), Iberia
(full service), Aer Lingus and Iberia Express (value service), Vueling and
LEVEL (low-cost service). IAG’s strategy is to provide varying levels of
service through these brands. For example BA has built its reputation around
its brand values, and seeks to stay ahead of the competition by providing
consistently good service and quality customer experiences. Vueling is a low￾cost airline, and IAG has invested in new systems, baggage handling
and passenger queuing procedures to provide a more efficient and
effective service, and to maintain good standards of service for customers at
low-cost.
The modern marketing concept can be expressed as the achievement of
corporate goals through meeting and exceeding customer needs and
expectations better than the competition.
To apply this concept, three conditions should be met:
1. Company activities should focus on providing customer satisfaction rather
than making things easier and better for the producer or manufacturer. This
is not an easy condition to meet, but it is a necessity to place the customer at
the centre of all activity.2. The achievement of customer satisfaction relies on integrated effort. The
responsibility for the implementation of the concept lies not just within the
marketing department. The belief that customer needs are central to the
operation of a company should run right through production, finance,
research and development, engineering and other departments. The role of
the marketing department is to play ‘champion’ for the concept and to
coordinate activities. But the concept is a business philosophy, not a
departmental duty.
3. For integrated effort to work successfully, management must believe that
corporate goals can be achieved through satisfied customers (see Figure
1.2).
FIGURE 1.2
Key components of the marketing concept
Adopting a Market Orientation in a
Changing World
There is no guarantee that all companies will adopt the marketing concept.
However, past research (e.g. Hooley and Lynch 1985; Pulendran et al. 2003;
Homburg et al. 2015) found evidence that the adoption of a market
orientation could lead to significant performance benefits. From Netflix and
Amazon to Coca-Cola and DHL, tens of thousands of companies large and
small have succeeded due to constantly paying attention to the demands ofpage 8
customers and what it takes to deliver satisfaction. Research also suggested the
adoption of a market orientation approach as an evolutionary process whereby
companies move from unawareness to complete acceptance of the importance
of the marketing concept (Hooley et al. 1990; Jaworski and Kohli 1993) as a
means of defining the orientation of a business. Consequently, companies
focus on customer needs, and change is recognized as endemic, with
adaptation considered a Darwinian condition for survival (Slater and Narver
1998, 1999). Changing needs present potential market opportunities to drive a
company forwards. Within the boundaries of their distinctive competences,
market-driven companies seek to adapt their product and service offerings to
the demands of current and latent markets. Figure 1.3 shows the basic
elements of the market orientation.
FIGURE 1.3
Basic elements of the market orientation
A competing philosophy is production orientation, an inward-looking
stance whereby managers become focused on the internal aspects of their
business. It is particularly evident in manufacturing companies, where
employees spend their working day at the point of production. In this case,
first, management becomes cost focused and believes that its job is to attain
economies of scale by producing a limited range of products (at the extreme,
just one) in a form that minimizes production costs. Henry Ford is quoted as an
example of a production-orientated manager because he built just one car in
one colour–the black Model T–in order to minimize costs. However, this is
unfair to Mr Ford, since his objective was customer satisfaction–bringing the
car to new market segments through low prices. The real production-orientated
manager has no such virtues. The objective is cost reduction for its own sake,
an objective at least partially fuelled by the greater comfort and convenience
that comes from producing a narrow product range.Second, the belief that the business should be defined in terms of its
production facilities becomes ingrained in management practices. Figure 1.4
illustrates production orientation in its crudest form. If the production
capabilities of an organization are allowed to define the business mission, the
purpose of the organization can become organized around the manufacture of
products and then aggressive selling to customers, rather than focusing on
delivering value and customer satisfaction.
FIGURE 1.4
Production orientation
Marketing is evolving in response to the changing world and there are
implications for the strategic application of the traditional market concept, for
example the rise in importance of relationships, societal values and digital
marketing has brought about change. But, according to Quinn et al. (2016),
while change occurs to some aspects of marketing, others remain as constants.
Digital marketing as a discrete area of marketing activity has developed during
the last 25 years from a computer-generated communication channel used by a
few companies into a powerful phenomenon that potentially affects every
aspect of organizational activity across the globe. The shift towards digital
marketing is changing the focus of the application of marketing, but these
authors argue that its core principles are enduring:
Search for latent markets (new market opportunities): can be a challenge in
well-developed economies, but digital technology has provided the capacity
to delve deeply into the nooks and crannies of human behaviour and, in
doing so, has given rise to many new market opportunities, for both existing
and innovative products and services. Amazon.com, Inc. developed Alexa–
its range of voice-activated devices–to facilitate easier access to thousands
of products and services.
Customer focused: sophisticated data analytics provide deeper insights into
how to achieve customer satisfaction and stimulate repeat purchasing
behaviour. Google LLC and Facebook, Inc. use customer data to enable the
delivery of highly targeted messages and use their customer insights to sell
advertising.page 9
Integrated effort: can extend to organizations outside the firm (e.g.
logistics), and the delivery of the products and services are often far
removed from a firm’s staff members. DHL provides delivery services,
dedicated warehousing and even two-man home delivery for large home
appliances for many UK retailers, but in doing so focuses on giving
excellent service. So, in the digital era, firms should plan how to extend
their integrated efforts across multiple touchpoints that a customer might
encounter.
Goal achievement: perhaps an area where marketing faces its greatest
challenges as performance measurement data is now gathered every step of
the way towards a corporate goal (e.g. customer acquisition, sales, delivery,
return rates, customer retention), enabling more detailed and specific
analysis. Homburg et al. (2015) found a tension between sales and
marketing in relation to strategic decision-making, with sales challenging
the dominance of the marketing function, in part due to the availability and
accountability of sales performance information. Technology firms like IBM
are developing data science decision-making applications, which are
transforming business practices. IBM Watson analytics is an analysis system
that can identify business and market trends, and visualize the results on a
desktop or mobile device. Marketers are increasingly being challenged to
prove the benefits of marketing efforts.
Marketing and performance
The basic underlying premise of the marketing concept remains that its
adoption will improve organizational performance. Marketing is not an
abstract concept: its acid test is the effect that its use has on key corporate
indices, such as profitability and market share. Increasingly, however, this
must be supported with hard evidence, which is a challenge for marketing.
Research in Europe and North America has examined the relationship between
marketing and performance, and the results suggest that the relationship is
positive.
In a study of 1,700 senior marketing executives, Hooley and Lynch (1985)
reported the marketing characteristics of high- versus low-performing
companies. The approach that they adopted was to isolate the top 10 per centof companies (based on such measures as profit margin, return on investment
and market share) and to compare their marketing practices with those of the
remainder of the sample. The ‘high flyers’ differed from the ‘also rans’ in that
they:
were more committed to marketing research
were more likely to be found in new, emerging or growth markets
adopted a more proactive approach to marketing planning
were more likely to use strategic planning tools
placed more emphasis on product performance and design, rather than price,
for achieving a competitive advantage
worked more closely with the finance department
placed greater emphasis on market share as a method of evaluating
marketing performance.
Narver and Slater (1990) took this a step further and studied the
relationship between market orientation and business performance. Market
orientation was based on three measures: customer orientation, competitor
orientation and degree of inter-functional coordination. They collected data
from 113 strategic business units (SBUs) of a major US corporation. The
businesses comprised 36 commodity businesses (forestry products) and 77
non-commodity businesses (speciality products and distribution businesses).
They related each SBU’s profitability, as measured by return on assets in
relation to competitors’ over the last year in the SBU’s principal served market,
to their three-component measure of market orientation.
Figure 1.5 shows the results of Narver and Slater’s study. For commodity
businesses, the relationship was U-shaped, with low and high market
orientation businesses showing higher profitability than businesses in the mid￾range of market orientation. Businesses with the highest market orientation
had the highest profitability, and those with the lowest market orientation had
the second-highest profitability. Narver and Slater explained this result by
suggesting that the businesses lowest in market orientation may achieve some
profit success through a low-cost strategy, though not the profit levels of the
high market orientation businesses, an explanation supported by the fact that
they were the largest companies of the three groups.
FIGURE 1.5
The relationship between market orientation and profitabilitypage 10
For the non-commodity businesses, the relationship was linear, with the
businesses displaying the highest level of market orientation achieving the
highest levels of profitability, and those with the lowest scores on market
orientation having the lowest profitability figures. As the authors state, ‘The
findings give marketing scholars and practitioners a basis beyond mere
intuition for recommending the superiority of a market orientation’ (Narver
and Slater 1990).
Kohli and Jaworski (1990) placed more emphasis on the sharing of market
intelligence across an organization as a significant route towards identifying
the needs of existing and new customers.
Many research studies confirm a positive relationship between market
orientation and business performance on sales growth, market share and
profitability (Pelham 2000), sales growth (Narver et al. 1999), strategic
orientation, and overall business performance (Balodi 2014) and international
performance (Cadogan et al. 2003). Kirca et al. (2005) analysed the empirical
findings from a wide range of studies that sought to identify the antecedents
and consequences of market orientation. Their findings showed that a market
orientation led to higher overall business performance (higher profits, sales
and market share), better customer consequences (higher perceived quality,
customer loyalty and customer satisfaction), better innovative consequences
(higher innovativeness and better new product performance) and beneficial
employee consequences (higher organizational commitment, team spirit,customer orientation and job satisfaction, and lower role conflict). Their
analysis of the antecedents of the market orientation showed the importance to
the implementation of market orientation of top management’s emphasis on
marketing, good communications between departments and systems that
reward employees for market success.
So, what overall conclusions can be drawn from these studies? To make a
balanced judgement, limitations must be recognized. Most were cross￾sectional studies based on self-reported data. With any such survey there is the
question of the direction of causality. However, this clearly did not occur with
the commodity sample in the Narver and Slater (1990) study. What these
studies have consistently and unambiguously shown is a strong association
between marketing and business performance. As one condition for
establishing causality, this is an encouraging result for those people concerned
with promoting the marketing concept as a guiding philosophy for business.
These studies have been supplemented with further empirical evidence
showing a positive link between a market orientation and business
performance, for example in the case of Amazon, a company that focuses its
efforts on creating a customer-centric culture throughout the business. Read

OTT Marketing Success
Disney+ is a global entertainment corporation and one of the world’s largest over-the-top
(OTT) media providers of programmes and movies accessible via the internet. This means
Disney+ provides access to live-streaming services and video-on-demand through
subscription-based programmes that do not rely on cable, broadcast or satellite television
platforms to deliver content to customers. This in turn means that customers can access the
OTT service anywhere at any time via mobile devices, smartphones, laptops, games
consoles and more. This is evidencing a further fundamental shift in behaviour relating to
consumption of audio-visual products, and is creating a highly competitive market between
OTT platform providers such as Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime and Disney+.
The big players compete to offer the best entertainment streaming services, which offer
highly customized and on-demand video and film content to a growing number of
customers. Payment methods (free supported by advertising revenue, subscription, pay on
demand) vary, as does the content provided. The table below gives details of Disney+’s
competitors.page 11

Strategically, Disney+ wants to expand its reach to a wider range of customers through
direct streaming services.
Content and delivery channels are key areas where video-on-demand services compete.
Disney+ has a strong portfolio of companies under its brand umbrella, which it can use to
produce new content (e.g. 20th Century Studios, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Searchlight
Pictures).

The marketing success of Disney+ OTT streaming services is primarily driven by content. At
its launch in 2019, the service offered less choice of content to its customers than did its
rivals, but ensured the available content was of consistently high quality, as Disney+ has
access to an extensive library of content from the brands in its portfolio. The brand also
understands its customers very well, and uses various methods and techniques to access
customer feedback, such as social listening to garner feedback on its streamed content.
Social listening by tracking social media posts and turning this information into useable data
insights can instantly provide feedback on consumer comments about individual products
and services. In this way, by developing a deep understanding of customer preferences,
Disney+ has been able to deliver highly customized content to its subscribers.
In addition to top-quality content, Disney+ has access to highly accomplished marketing
communications teams, which are able to reach consumers around the globe through highly
targeted omnichannel campaigns. To promote the launch of the Disney+ service, they used
Facebook to drive awareness with desktop video ads, but at the same time used television,
radio, outdoor advertising and digital display boards.
The results of this strategy can be seen in the business’s increasing revenues, which rose
from $4.5 billion in 2020 to $10 billion in 2021.
Questions:
1. Discuss the extent to which Disney+ is applying a market-orientated focus to
generate business success.
2. Make a case for Disney+ being considered a ‘high flyer’ when looking at its
performance and use of marketing.

Understanding Market-driven
Businesses
To gain from the performance benefits of adopting a market orientation,
marketers should understand the practical implications of applying this guiding
philosophy. A deeper understanding of the marketing concept and orientation
can be gained by contrasting a market-driven business with an internally
focused business that focuses mainly on production orientation. Table 1.1
summarizes the key differences.TABLE 1.1 Contrasting businesses: market versus internal focus
Market focus Internal focus
Customer concern throughout business Convenience comes first
Knowledge of customer choice criteria enables
matching with marketing mix
Assume price and product performance is
key to generating sales
Segment by customer differences Segment by product
Invest in market research (MR) and track
market changes
Rely on anecdotes and received wisdom
Welcome change Cherish status quo
Try to understand competition Ignore competition
Regard marketing spend as an investment Regard marketing spend as a luxury
Innovation rewarded Innovation punished
Search for latent markets Stick with the same
Are fast Think ‘Why rush?’
Strive for competitive advantage Are happy to be ‘me too’
Are efficient and effective Are efficient
Market-driven companies display customer concern throughout the
business. All departments recognize the importance of the customer to the
success of the business. Nestlé, for example, has placed the customer at the
centre of its business philosophy by giving the company’s head of marketing
responsibility for the company’s seven strategic business units. Marketers also
control strategy, research and development and production in the context of the
markets in which they operate, which may require adjustment and adaptation
to remain focused on satisfying the customer. For internally-focused
businesses, convenience comes first. If customer wants are inconvenient or
expensive to produce, excuses are often used as avoidance tactics. Market
research found that ‘42% of companies do not listen to their customers or
collect feedback’ (Andrews 2019), suggesting there are a large number of
companies that do not place sufficient emphasis on customers and their views.
Market-driven businesses know how their products and services are being
evaluated by customers against those of the competition. They understand thepage 13
choice criteria that customers are using, and ensure that their marketing mix
and service mix match these criteria better than those of their competitors.
Selecting which elements of the mix to utilize can have both strategic and
tactical implementations.
Businesses driven by the market base their segmentation analyses on
customer differences that have implications for marketing strategy. Businesses
focused internally segment by product and, consequently, are vulnerable when
customers’ requirements change. Global cosmetics producer L’Oréal knows its
customers very well and places ‘customer experience’ central to its business
activities. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the brand experienced significant
growth in online sales. This change in purchasing behaviour prompted L’Oréal
to review the service it was offering to online customers and introduce new
online services features to enhance its service offer (see Exhibit 1.1).
EXHIBIT 1.1

experience

A key feature of market-driven businesses is their recognition that
marketing research expenditure is an investment that can yield
rich rewards through better customer understanding. Toyota is a
market-led company that uses market research extensively. The company
focuses all its efforts on continuous improvements and pays attention to what
will make customers smile (Toyota 2022). The car manufacturer surveys its
customers regularly to determine their opinions and values, for example a
Toyota Yaris research event invited owners to take part in market research tohelp to develop future vehicles and features (Take Part in Research 2022). The
Yaris is specially designed to meet the needs of the European consumer, and
Toyota’s Optimal Drive technology was designed to provide its customers with
the benefit of enhanced performance, lower emissions and better fuel
economy.
Internally driven businesses see marketing research as a non-productive
intangible, preferring to rely on anecdotes and received wisdom. Market￾orientated businesses welcome the organizational changes that are bound to
occur as an organization moves to maintain a strategic fit between its
environment and its strategies. In contrast, internally orientated businesses
cherish the status quo and resist change.
Attitudes towards competition also differ. Whereas market-driven
businesses try to understand competitive objectives and strategies, and to
anticipate competitive action, internally driven companies are content to ignore
the competition. Marketing spend is regarded as an investment that has long￾term consequences in market-driven businesses. The alternative view is that
marketing expenditure is a luxury that never appears to produce benefits.
In market-orientated companies, employees who take risks and are
innovative are rewarded. Recognition of the fact that most new products fail is
reflected in a reluctance to punish those people who risk their career
championing a new product idea. Internally orientated businesses, on the other
hand, reward ‘time serving’ and the ability not to make mistakes. This results
in risk avoidance and the continuance of the status quo. Market-driven
businesses search for latent markets (markets that no other company has yet
exploited). Internally driven businesses are happy to stick with their existing
products and markets, while externally driven businesses respond to changing
demands in the market. For example, the move towards ethical consumption
has created opportunities. Marks & Spencer, for instance, has taken action
across its supply chain to improve the ethical credentials of its products, and
has set ambitious goals to become net zero across its entire supply chain by
2040 (Wadham 2021). European fashion retailer C&A has set goals for 2028
that aim to create a culture of sustainability for customers, suppliers and
employees. New companies have been created using ethical principles: One
Water donates 100 per cent of its profits to life-saving projects in Africa. Read
Marketing in Action 1.1 to find out more about H&M’s approach towards
sustainability. Chapter 3 discusses sustainable marketing and society in detail.page 14
MARKETING IN ACTION 1.1
H&M: Look Good, Do Good, Feel Good
Spending on ethical products is growing each year across Europe. In the UK, the market is
worth more than £100 billion. Demand in ethical markets for sustainable fashion, food
products, transport and green energy continues to grow, and these markets appear to be
more robust than other parts of the economy, even when consumers are economizing and
spending less. In their study of fashion retailers in Sweden, Pedersen et al. (2018) found
that innovative companies are more likely to actively pursue sustainable business models.
Fashion brands tend to be highly flexible businesses, able to respond to changing trends.
Many fashion brands in Europe have begun to adapt their practices to improve the
sustainability of their businesses in order to stay in touch with younger buyers of fashion,
who are becoming increasingly interested in sustainability. One such company is H&M.
Source: Martin de Jong/Shutterstock
H&M is a retail organization that proactively searches for marketing opportunities, and
responds to wider market trends such as sustainable products. The company opened its
first store selling women’s clothing in 1947 in Vasteras, Sweden. The brand expanded into
other parts of Scandinavia before opening its first store in London in 1976.
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, store openings continued and, by 2018, H&M
was recognized as the world’s second-largest fashion retailer, operating in Europe, Asia,
North and South America, the Middle East and online.
H&M has put sustainability at the heart of its business and has aims to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions by 2030. Sustainable initiatives and targets are being incorporated at every
level, from product design, raw materials, production and manufacturing through to logistics
and sales. For example, at the product level it has launched a new brand, ARKET, which
focuses on delivering sustainable designs. The firm also intends this brand to lead the
fashion industry towards more transparency in the supply chain. The Conscious Collection,
which incorporates organic and recycled materials into its product ranges, is another way in
which H&M is getting across the sustainability message to customers. In 2019, 29,005
tonnes of clothing were collected and reused.
While the firm aims to bring sustainable fashion to everyone and to deliver on its vision, it
still has some way to go before the changes bring about the realization of its long-term
promises.Based on: Balch (2013); Guardian (2015): Pedersen et al. (2018); Young (2018); Wood
(2021); H&M (2022); Robertson (2022)
Intensive competition means market-driven companies should respond
quickly to latent markets. They need to innovate, manufacture and distribute
their products and services rapidly if they are to succeed before the ‘strategic
window of opportunity’ closes (Abell 1978). In contrast, internally driven
companies tend to take their time. An example of a company that was slow to
respond to the opportunities in the mobile computer market is Microsoft. It
introduced the tablet PC and carved a niche market in the health sector, but in
2010 Apple launched the iPad, which widened market demand, and it now
dominates this sector.
A key feature of market-orientated companies is that they strive for
competitive advantage. They seek to serve customers better than the
competition, while internally orientated companies are happy to produce me￾too copies of offerings already on the market.
Finally, market-orientated companies are both efficient and effective, while
internally orientated companies achieve only efficiency. The concepts of
efficiency and effectiveness are discussed in the next section.
Efficiency versus effectiveness
Another perspective on business philosophy can be gained by understanding
the distinction between efficiency and effectiveness (Brown 1987). Efficiency
is concerned with inputs and outputs. An efficient firm produces goods
economically–it does things right. The benefit is that the cost per unit of output
is low and therefore the potential for offering low prices to gain market share
is present, or of charging medium to high prices and achieving high profit
margins. For example, car companies attempt to achieve efficiency by gaining
economies of scale and building several models on the same subframe and
with the same components. However, to be successful, a company needs to be
more than just efficient–it needs to be effective too. Effectiveness means doing
the right things. This implies operating in attractive markets and making
products that customers want to buy. Conversely, companies that operate in
unattractive markets or are not producing what customers want to buy will go
out of business; the only question is one of timing.page 15
The link between performance and combinations of efficiency and
effectiveness can be conceived as shown in Figure 1.6. A company that is both
inefficient and ineffective will go out of business quickly because it is a high￾cost producer of products that customers do not want to buy. The Hummer
SUV became a ‘must have’ vehicle early in the 2000s, but its high purchase
cost, high running costs and high levels of carbon emissions led to its failure.
High-profile owners like Arnold Schwarzenegger, David Beckham and Paris
Hilton abandoned their Hummers and the brand failed as it ceased to be a
viable purchase option (Tran 2010). In 2010, Starbucks created evening stores
with product extensions, including beer and wine, and table service in
thousands of outlets in the US and a few selected stores in the UK. The aim
was to increase customer traffic later in the day. But the table service for the
evenings conflicted with the counter service offered in the morning and
customers didn’t respond well. In 2017, the programme was
discontinued in many stores and Starbucks looked for other ways
to tap in to the night-time economy (Trefis Team 2017).
FIGURE 1.6
Efficiency and effectiveness
A company that is efficient and ineffective may last a little longer because
its low-cost base may generate more profits from the dwindling sales volume it
is achieving. Once, BlackBerry devices were an innovative product and global
leaders in the smartphone market, in part due to the then innovative QWERTY
keyboard. But when Apple, Inc. and Android devices incorporated touchscreen
keyboards and larger screens in their smartphones, BlackBerry was left behind.
Sales began to decline rapidly and even the new versions of the device could
not compete with the sleek, elegant designs of Apple and Android
smartphones. The device could no longer compete or satisfy customers’ needs
(Worth 2016).Firms that are effective but inefficient are likely to survive, however,
because they are operating in attractive markets and are marketing products
that customers want to buy. Department stores provide a destination for
shoppers as they offer a wide range of goods all in one place, and once were
an important type of retailer for towns and cities as they attracted shoppers.
John Lewis Partnership is an example of this type of retailer, which remains
successful, but now operates using an omnichannel strategy (store, mobile,
online and 900 click-and-collect locations in partner stores), which allows it to
reach out to customers where they live, as well as being a destination store in
major towns. Department stores are becoming an ineffective way of retailing,
however, due to a combination of the high costs of operating large, expensive
retail premises, managing multiple product ranges and changing shopping
habits: more online and mobile shopping, and increased spending on leisure
activities. There are many examples of department store businesses that have
not survived or have filed for insolvency, including Debenhams (UK), Vroom
& Dreesmann (Netherlands) and Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof (Germany).
Toyota is an example of an efficient and effective manufacturing company.
Its investment in modern production practices ensures efficiency, while
effectiveness is displayed by research and development investment into new
products that consumers want to buy. Inditex, the Spanish owner of the Zara,
Pull&Bear and Bershka fashion chains, has also thrived through a combination
of efficiency and effectiveness by using its own highly efficient automated
manufacturing and distribution facilities, clothing workers in 350
independently owned workshops in Spain and Portugal, and low advertising
expenditures (its shops have always been its primary marketing tool). The
company is highly effective, as it matches quickly changing fashion trends by
means of an extremely fast and responsive supply chain. The result is that
Inditex has become the world’s largest clothing retailer by sales: €27.72 billion
in fiscal year 2021 (Statista 2022).
Arguably, a combination of efficiency and effectiveness leads to optimum
business success. Firms do well and thrive by operating in attractive markets,
supplying products that consumers want and benefiting from a low-cost base
and efficient production. But there are examples of companies that have found
ways to survive and thrive by doing things differently. Many smaller
companies operating in niche markets fall into the effective/inefficient
category. One such example is Morgan Motor Company (Exhibit 1.2), which
manufactures bespoke, high-specification sports cars. Prices for the basic
model start at less than £66,000 and the company has a long waiting list ofpage 16
customer orders, but the factory continues to manufacture fewer than 850
handmade cars a year. Morgan is an independent family business, which places
emphasis on building and maintaining relationships with both customers and
employees. This approach helps it to build loyalty and retain customers.
Relationship marketing has become so important to marketing that we have a
whole chapter devoted to the subject: Chapter 5, which deals with value
creation and relationship marketing.

The essential difference between efficiency and effectiveness is that the
former is primarily cost focused, while the latter is customer focused. An
effective company can attract and retain customers while remaining cost
efficient. These principles should be applied according to the market
conditions and can be crucial to delivering successful performance. As markets
change, the definitions of efficiency and effectiveness also need to adapt. For
example, before the advent of online shopping, customers would be happy and
satisfied if a firm delivered their ordered goods within, say, seven days and
would have very limited information about when they would arrive. In contrast
now customers expect delivery within two days of placing an order ideally the
next day or even the same day. To achieve this new level of efficiency, firmshave had to make changes and streamline their logistical operations, and to be
effective they have, in many cases, had to increase the number of delivery
channels and improve the predictability of when deliveries will be made, to
meet customer expectations. Such changes are contributing to the evolution of
marketing, and also creating opportunities to meet and exceed customer
expectations.
Creating Customer Value, Satisfaction,
Loyalty and Relationships
Customer expectations in all markets are evolving, and creating value is a
primary aim of market-orientated businesses. Four key benefits can be derived
from adopting marketing as a guiding business philosophy:
1. customer value
2. customer satisfaction
3. customer loyalty
4. long-term customer relationships.
Customer value
Market-orientated companies attempt to create customer value to attract and
retain customers. Their aim is to deliver superior value to their target
customers. In doing so, they implement the marketing concept by meeting and
exceeding customer needs better than the competition. Chipotle Mexican Grill,
Inc. aims to sell responsibly sourced fast food from its 3,000 restaurants in
USA, Canada, UK, France and Germany. The company has more than 100,000
employees, who are passionate about their customers. Everyone focuses on
delivering excellent customer experiences. Chipotle regularly wins awards
relating to its employees, such as best company for diversity, company culture
and happiness. The company values are translated into benefits for its
customers, for example great-tasting fresh food, responsibly managed meat,
responsible management of waste (Chipotle 2022) (see Exhibit 1.3). This
example demonstrates that customer value can be derived from many aspects
of what a company delivers to its customers, beyond the basic product.page 17

Customer value is dependent on how the customer perceives the benefits of
an offering and the sacrifice that is associated with its purchase. Therefore:
Perceived benefits can be derived from the product (e.g. in Chipotle’s case,
the taste of the burrito), the associated service (e.g. how quickly customers are
served and the cleanliness of the outlet) and the image of the
company (e.g. whether the image of the company/product is
favourable). If one of these factors–for example, product benefits–changes,
then the perceived benefits and customer value also change. For instance, fast￾food restaurants largely rely on using disposable packaging and utensils for
their products, much of which is not recyclable and is therefore bad for the
environment. Major brands in this industry have realized they need to address
this issue. Chipotle diverts 50 per cent of its waste away from landfill
(Chipotle 2022), while Pretaims to be ‘doing the right thing’ and to be highly
effective with its sustainability core values. It has a zero-landfill policy and is
aiming to make all of its packaging 100 per cent recyclable, reusable or
compostable (Pret 2022).
A further source of perceived benefits is the relationship between customer
and supplier. Customers may enjoy working with suppliers with which theyhave developed close personal and professional relationships, and value the
convenience of working with trusted partners.
Perceived sacrifice is the total cost associated with buying a product. This
consists of not just monetary cost, but the time and energy involved in
purchase. For example, in the case of fast-food restaurants, a convenient
location can reduce the time and energy customers need to expend on finding a
suitable eating place. Online cars sales platform Cinch positions itself as
selling cars ‘without the faff’, thereby reducing the costs associated with
searching for a used car to buy. However, marketers need to be aware of
another critical sacrifice in some buying situations: the potential psychological
cost of not making the right decision.
Uncertainty leads people to perceive risk when making a purchase.
McDonald’s, for instance, attempts to reduce perceived risk by standardizing
its complete offer so that customers can be confident of what they will receive
before entering its outlets. Chipotle and Pret aim to reduce perceived risk of
buying fast food that endangers the planet.
In organizational markets, companies offer guarantees to reduce the
perceived risk of purchase, and often produce marketing communications that
highlight the features of a product or service (as in the example shown in
Exhibit 1.4).

Figure 1.7 illustrates how perceived benefits and sacrifice affect customer
value. It provides a framework for considering ways of maximizing value. The
objective is to find ways of raising perceived benefits and reducing perceived
sacrifice. The benefits should be in accord with customer values and reflect the
market environment context (see Chapter 2 for further discussion of this).
FIGURE 1.7
Creating customer value
Customer satisfaction
Exceeding the value offered by competitors is key to marketing success.
Consumers decide upon purchases based on judgements about the value
offered by suppliers; this decision is based on the sum of customers’
perceptions, evaluations and psychological reactions to a product or service
experience (Benoit et al. 2020). Once a product has been bought, customer
satisfaction depends upon the product’s perceived performance compared with
the buyer’s expectations. Customer satisfaction occurs when perceived
performance matches or exceeds expectations. Successful companies such as
LEGO, Toyota, Samsung, H&M, Waitrose, Apple and Virgin place customer
satisfaction at the heart of their business philosophy. Companies facing
difficulties, such as General Motors (GM), Chrysler, Gap and Kodak, have at
one time failed to meet customer needs. As expectations change, companies
need to find ways to refocus on the customer or otherwise potentially face
business collapse. GM operated a hierarchal multidivisional structure,which stifled internal communications and was financially burdensome. In the
mid-2000s, at a time of increasing financial pressure, the firm focused on
developing and selling financial products rather than ensuring its vehicles met
customer needs and ensured satisfaction (Senter and McManus 2013).
Arguably, GM lost focus on its core markets and eventually faced bankruptcy.
To turn things around, it changed the management culture, implemented a
corporate restructure and focused on producing vehicles that were in demand,
which saved the business. Currently, it is investing in electronic and
autonomous vehicles as a way of securing its future.
ASOS, a successful online fashion retailer, has succeeded in creating
customer satisfaction by looking to the digital future. The company satisfies its
young customers’ desire to replicate the looks of their favourite celebrities,
such as Jourdan Dunn and Gal Gadot, by offering affordable versions of
celebrity styles. Read more about ASOS in Chapter 16 (Case 31).
Customer satisfaction is taken so seriously that it is considered a key
success factor and is what drives competition in many industries. Banks focus
on customer satisfaction and constantly seek to delight customers by providing
superior service. Mobile banking has changed how customers behave and
heightened competitive pressures, particularly as it has become easier in the
digital world for customers to compare service and prices, and to switch banks
(Hamidi and Safareeyeh 2019). Starling and Monzo are examples of mobile
banks that are challenging traditional high-street banks like Barclays, Lloyds,
HSBC and NatWest. The challengers are responding to the increase in the
number of people choosing to do their banking via smartphone, offering
digitized, personalized and low-cost bank accounts and, in doing so, are
increasing customer expectations of banking service provision more widely. In
today’s competitive climate, it is often not enough to match performance and
expectations. For commercial success, expectations need to be exceeded so
that customers are delighted with the outcome. To understand the concept of
customer satisfaction, the so-called ‘Kano model’ (Figure 1.8) helps to
separate characteristics that cause dissatisfaction, satisfaction and delight.
Three characteristics underlie the model: ‘must be’, ‘more is better’ and
‘delighters’.
FIGURE 1.8
Creating customer satisfactionpage 19
‘Must be’ characteristics are expected to be present and are taken for
granted. For example, in a hotel, customers expect service at
reception and a clean room. The lack of these characteristics
causes annoyance, but their presence serves only to bring dissatisfaction up to
a neutral level. The presence of ‘more is better’ characteristics can take
satisfaction past neutral and into the positive satisfaction range. For example,
no response to a telephone call can cause dissatisfaction, but a fast response
may cause positive satisfaction or even delight. ‘Delighters’ are the unexpected
characteristics that surprise the customer. Their absence does not cause
dissatisfaction, but their presence delights the customer. For example, a hotel
chain providing a free basket of fruit on arrival in a visitor’s room, creating
memorable experiences, doing something out of the ordinary. Luxury hotel
The Ritz-Carlton is an example of an organization that has taken this idea a
step further by training all of its staff to meet guests’ ‘unexpressed needs’,
empowering them to create unique personal experiences. This delights many of
its customers, who were not expecting such treats.
A problem for marketers, however, is that over time ‘delighters’ become
expected. For example, car manufacturers provide small, unexpected
delighters such as pen holders and delay mechanisms on interior lights that
allow drivers time to find the ignition socket at night, which have now become
standard on most cars and are therefore ‘must be’ characteristics, as customersexpect them. This means that marketers must constantly strive to find new
ways of delighting. Innovative thinking and listening to customers are key
ingredients in this.
The importance of customer satisfaction is supported by studies which
show that higher levels of customer satisfaction lead to better performance–
that is, higher financial performance (profits and sales), greater customer
loyalty (Homberg et al. 2005) and increased repurchase intentions (Majeed et
al. 2022). In competitive markets, there is also a strong relationship between a
firm’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) and customer satisfaction, as a
strong CSR strategy can reduce uncertainty and increase satisfaction (Sun and
Price 2016). Customer satisfaction is linked to customer loyalty and
profitability (Srinivasan et al. 2002). It can cost up to six times more to attract
a new customer than to retain an existing one (Strauss et al. 2006).
Customer loyalty
In most situations, returning customers are beneficial to an organization, as
they can increase sales volumes through repeat purchases. Loyalty is a
response that a customer shows over time. Typically, customers will return to
the same supplier repeatedly if they are satisfied with the products or services
they receive (Christodoulides and Michaelidou 2011). Customer loyalty can be
built on convenience, quality of service and/or social interaction; it can take
different forms and be triggered by different marketing initiatives. For
example, Tesco uses sales promotions through its loyalty card programme to
trigger repeat customer purchase behaviour. Arguably, this type of loyalty is
driven by price, and the promotion acts as an incentive to trigger repeat
purchase. Customer loyalty can be temporarily shaken when a company
changes its brand identity, as Marketing in Action 1.2 explains. However,
customization can increase perceptions of service quality, satisfaction and
trust, with the outcome of generating improved customer loyalty (Coelho and
Henseler 2012).
MARKETING IN ACTION 1.2
Brand Loyalty Wobbles When Starbucks Employs a
Siren That’s Just Too Perfectpage 20
Customer value is closely linked with perceptions of a brand, so when changes are made to
a brand’s identity they should be meaningful to customers in such a way that they will
continue to make positive brand associations and buy the products and services offered. In
2011, Starbucks launched its new global brand identity as a mark of the company’s 40 years
in business.
Source: (l)ACnoncc/Alamy Stock Photo, (r)Taa photo/Shutterstock
According to Steve Barrett, Starbucks former global creative vice-president, the
new look tested well with loyal consumers. However, the removal of the words
Starbucks and coffee from the iconic green logo initially annoyed many of its customers,
and they complained in their hundreds on the brand’s official Facebook page, saying the
new logo ‘sucks’. Part of the problem was that the mermaid’s face was just too perfect, so
the global branding team decided the face should not be symmetrical. Take a look at the
image of the Starbucks logo and see how slight changes have sought to create
imperfections and, in so doing, to humanize the image. The company aimed to give the
brand a less corporate and more contemporary feel.
The initial resistance to the change of identity did not last, and customers continue to flock
to Starbucks’ 32,000 outlets in 80 countries around the world. Starbucks continues to focus
on the market environment and its customers’ needs, with the introduction of new product
lines, for example customers can enjoy Almond Milk Cold Brew, Pistachio Latte and its
Earth Cake Pop.

2022)
At the other end of the scale is a form of loyalty that transcends emotional
boundaries: brand love. Brand love is an extension of the concept of loyalty
(Batra et al. 2012). Researchers have found that the connections between
individuals and the brands they choose are closely associated with the concept
of interpersonal physical love. However, while brand love has been found to
involve passion, positive emotional connections, long-term relationships,
positive attitudes and distress at the thought of separation, it does not leave
brand lovers as profoundly committed to a product as they might be to apersonal partner. Nevertheless, there are consequences for marketing
managers, and they should look for ways to turn liked brands into loved
brands.
Looking for ways to maintain this high level of commitment to the
relationship can be achieved by maximizing the following key opportunities.
Facilitate ‘passion-driven behaviour’, which is a strong commitment to use
the brand, as in the case of luxury designer brands (e.g. Gucci, Rolex,
Porsche).
Build brands that engender self-brand integration. This is the way the brand
connects to an individual’s values and deeper thought processes. Rewards
can be used effectively to emphasize the benefits of this higher-level
commitment. Samsung is an example of a brand that is attempting to
connect with customers by engendering self-identity through brand values
associated with the environment.
Create positive emotional connections. Brands that succeed in being
regarded as an ‘old friend’, creating a strong bond with the customer, benefit
by finding a place in the customer’s heart, creating a ‘warm glow’ that gives
rise to positive emotions. Personal care brand Dove created the Campaign
for Real Beauty to mark 60 years of its beauty products. The advertising
campaign sought to empower women to feel comfortable with their features
(Kim and Sullivan 2019). This example helped to reposition Dove soap with
emotional and culturally relevant advertising, and helped it to stand out in a
crowded fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market by adding personal
relevance (Ritson 2019) (see Exhibit 1.5 Dove Campaign for Real Beauty).

Long-term customer relationships
According to Sheth and Parvartiyar (1995), relationship marketing is a change
in direction for marketing thinking and practices, placing ‘emphasis on
relationships as opposed to transaction-based exchanges’. The benefit of this
redefinition of marketing is that a firm’s activities become focused on
attracting customers and seeking ways to retain them rather than just selling
the products and services that customers might need and want. Relationship
marketing enhances productivity and allows the firm and its customers to
develop mutual cooperation. In the digital age, technology has become
increasingly important in facilitating relationship development, and social
media has been used to understand and engage customers. Social media
platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram provide an opportunity forinteraction and information exchange between firms, employees and
customers. Social media maximizes customer engagement and creates
opportunities for marketers to react instantly when a customer tweets about a
bad (or good) customer experience. Rapid response in the digital arena can
also deliver relational benefits, as more than 70 per cent of customers are
likely to spend more if a firm has a good service history (Sklar 2013).
Relationship marketing is covered in greater detail in Chapter 5.
Marketing Planning
So far in this chapter we have discussed the conceptual meaning of marketing,
adopting a market orientation, the importance of efficiency and effectiveness,
ways to create customer value, satisfaction and loyalty, and the importance of
building customer relationships. In this final section of this chapter, we look at
the development of marketing planning from three perspectives: strategic,
tactical and implementation. It is important to note that these are all
substantive topics, so this is merely an introduction to some of the key ideas
and each topic is covered in detail in later chapters.
Marketing strategy is part of the overarching corporate strategic planning
process, and making marketing work requires much planning and effort across
an organization. Fundamentally, marketing planning functions at two levels:
1. At a business level the focus is strategic in nature and involves: setting a
business mission; identifying the vision driving the firm forwards; carrying
out a marketing audit (an analysis of a firm’s current trading situation);
conducting a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats)
analysis to inform strategic direction; and setting high-level marketing
objectives, which define the target markets and selection of goods and
services offered by a firm.
2. At a product and/or service level the focus is on the practical application of
marketing. This level involves many decisions about how to use the product
and service mix to create competitive advantage and then how these
decisions are implemented.
Driving the planning process is strategic marketing, which pulls together
the planning process and the tactical application of the marketing and service
mix. Chapter 17 discusses marketing planning in detail.page 22
Strategic marketing
Strategy is defined as a firm’s conscious efforts to use its resources to leverage
advantage (Hamel and Prahalad 1994), and adding a marketing perspective
brings a valuable focus on how to use these resources to stand out from the
competition and make it more difficult for other firms to copy (Wu 2011). This
process involves analysing competitors and creating a competitive advantage,
and is so important to the development of strategic marketing plans that
Chapter 18 is devoted to discussing these topics.
Tactical marketing
Gupta (2009) reminds us of the importance of the customer (as well as other
metrics: profits, stock valuations) when deploying marketing tactically. To gain
the most benefit, it is suggested that elements of the marketing and service mix
should not only focus on brands, products and services, but should also reach
out to enhance value, customer satisfaction and loyalty in the longer term. For
example, L’Oréal, a global firm, has a wide portfolio of cosmetic brands:
L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline, Garnier, Essie, Kerastase and Matrix. Its senior
management focus on and invest heavily in research and development to
ensure long-term customer satisfaction so that their ranges remain of interest to
customers, deploying technology in their communications to reach both new
and existing customers (Millington 2015).
Tactical marketing is often viewed as the deployment of the marketing mix
and consists of four major elements: product, price, promotion and place.
These ‘Four-Ps’ highlight four key decision areas that marketers must manage
to meet tactical and, ultimately, strategic goals. See Chapters 9, 10 and 12 to
16 for detailed discussions of each of the elements of the marketing mix and
related topics.
Furthermore, the growth of the service industries has given rise to an
extended marketing mix of seven ‘Ps’, with the services marketing mix adding
three decision areas to consider: people, physical evidence and process (Booms
and Bitner 1981). The need for the extension came about due to the high
degree of direct contact between the firm and the customer, the highly visiblenature of the service assembly process, and the simultaneity of production and
consumption. Booms and Bitner argued for a ‘Seven-Ps’ approach to services
marketing, as they suggest that the Four-Ps take no account of service delivery.
While it is possible to discuss people, physical evidence and process within the
original Four-Ps framework (e.g. people could be considered part of the
product offering), the extension allows a more thorough analysis of the
marketing ingredients necessary for successful marketing planning and
activities. In services, people often are the service itself, the process or how the
service is delivered to the customer is usually a key part of the service, and the
physical evidence–the décor of the restaurant or shop, for example–is so
critical to success that it should be considered as a separate element in the
services marketing mix. See Chapter 12 for a detailed discussion of services
marketing.
Marketing implementation
Marketing strategy concerns the issues of what should happen and why it
should happen. Implementation focuses on actions: who is responsible for
various activities, how the strategy should be carried out, where things will
happen and when action will take place. So managers devise marketing
strategies to meet new market opportunities, counter environmental threats and
match core competences. Designing marketing strategies and positioning plans
that meet today’s and tomorrow’s market requirements is a necessary, but
insufficient, condition for corporate success. They need to be translated into
action through effective implementation. While decisions regarding the
extended marketing mix form a major aspect of marketing concept
implementation, the emphasis and application of each of the elements of the
mix will vary depending on the products and services offered. For example,
BMW and Rolex are market-orientated companies that focus primarily on the
Four-Ps, as they are product manufacturers, but Starbucks and Burger King
focus primarily on the elements of the extended mix, as service, process and
physical evidence are at the heart of their fast-food restaurants. Marketing
implementation is the topic of Chapter 21.
Does Marketing Have All the Answers?page 23
In this chapter, we have considered how marketing as a discipline is adapting
to a changing world. Academics, however, have raised important questions
regarding the value of the market concept as a guiding principle, and
marketing managers should be alert to the following issues:
the marketing concept as an ideology
marketing and society
marketing as a constraint on innovation
marketing as a source of dullness
marketing as an intrusion
activism and authenticity.
The marketing concept as an ideology
Brownlie and Saren (1992) argue that the marketing concept has assumed
many of the characteristics of an ideology or an article of faith that should
dominate the thinking of organizations. They recognize the importance of a
consumer orientation for companies but ask why, after 40 years of trying, the
concept has not been fully implemented. They argue that there are other valid
considerations that companies must take into account when making decisions
(e.g. economies of scale), apart from giving customers exactly what they want.
Marketers’ attention should focus not only on propagation of the ideology but
also on its integration with the demands of other core business functions in
order to achieve a compromise between the satisfaction of consumers and the
achievement of other company requirements.
Marketing and society
A second limitation of the marketing concept concerns its focus on individual
market transactions. Since many individuals focus on personal benefits rather
than the societal impact of their purchases, the adoption of the marketing
concept will result in the production of goods and services that do not
adequately correspond to societal welfare. Providing customer satisfaction is
simply a means to achieve a company’s profit objective and does not guarantee
protection of the consumer’s welfare. This view was supported by Wensley(1990), who regards consumerism as a challenge to the adequacy of the
atomistic and individual view of market transactions. Bloom and Greyser
(1981) present an alternative view. They regard consumerism as the ultimate
expression of the marketing concept, compelling marketers to consider
consumer needs and wants that may hitherto have been overlooked, saying:
‘The resourceful manager will look for the positive opportunities created by
consumerism rather than brood over its restraints.’ In recent years, the role of
society in marketing has become more important.
Marketing as a constraint on innovation
Tauber (1974) presented a third criticism of marketing–that is, how marketing
research discourages major innovation. The thrust of his argument was that
relying on customers to guide the development of new products has severe
limitations. This is because customers have difficulty articulating needs
beyond the realm of their own experience. It is important to note that these
criticisms are not directed at the marketing concept itself but towards its faulty
implementation–an overdependence on customers as a source of new product
ideas. The marketing concept does not suggest that companies must depend
solely on the customer for new product ideas, rather it implies that new
product development should be based on sound interfacing between perceived
customer needs and technological research. At Google, for instance, innovation
is encouraged, and innovations are tested and launched–and sometimes
suspended. Examples include Froogle (product search engine, launched
November 2004, sidelined and renamed 2007), Google Sidewiki (web
annotation tool, launched 2009, discontinued December 2011), Google Buzz
(social network and messaging tool, launched September 2010, discontinued
December 2011), Google Glass (concept released 2012, suspended 2015) and
Google+ (launched 2011, suspended 2019). Innovations succeed only if they
satisfy the user and there is widespread uptake, and Google is very well
informed about which of its innovations are effective and which need to be
discontinued.
Marketing as a source of dullness
A fourth criticism of marketing is that its focus on analysing customers and
developing offerings that reflect their needs leads to dull marketing campaigns,
me-too products, copycat promotions and marketplace stagnation. Instead,page 24
marketing should create demand rather than simply reflect it. On one hand, this
approach can eventually lead to business failure, as in the case of BlackBerry,
where the products were surpassed by similar product offers both Apple and
Android. On the other hand, ‘dullness’ can be a source of innovation: at a tonic
water tasting in the US, Charles Rolls and Tim Warrillow noticed that many of
the products contained preservatives and artificial sweeteners (Fever-Tree
2018), so they went on a journey to make a new product range that offered
something different. Fever-Tree tonic was developed and very quickly became
the leading mixer beverage brand in the UK. Read more about Fever-Tree in
Chapter 19 (Case 38).
Marketing as an intrusion
A fifth and growing criticism of marketing has intensified as big data and
digital information firms, like Facebook, Google and Instagram, gather and
analyse data in such detail that they have great insight into what, when and
where to send marketing messages to trigger purchases (Kotler 2017). The
capacity of marketing messages to interrupt our lives is not a new
phenomenon–telephone marketing, cold-calling from sales agents and direct
mail are techniques that have been used to increase sales for several decades.
But, as the world has turned digital, the capacity and scope to send such
messages has increased significantly. Google and Facebook use targeted
messaging as a basis for the advertising revenue models for their platforms.
This approach is highly efficient and effective: if you search for a product or
service on Google (e.g. sunglasses), you are very likely to find that
adverts from sunglasses brands related to your generic search appear
when you visit a different platform such as Facebook, eBay or Twitter. Since
May 2018, the use of data has been controlled in Europe by the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR), with the intent of providing more personal data
security. This legislation aims to control how organizations can use personal
information.
Activism and authenticity
Finally, activism is increasingly bringing the responsibility of firms and brands
into the spotlight, and heightening the importance of social issues. Powerful
movements like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo challenge brands as they try
to establish a position, and signal to their customers the virtues andpage 25
authenticity of their brand values in light of such campaigns. Consumers
constantly expect more from brands and in this new age of activism there has
to be consideration of social issues, such as racism, sexism, discrimination and
equality. Consequently, brands are finding ways to go beyond the functional
and psychological benefits of products and services to respond to more
politically and social aware consumers, for example Delta Airlines cut benefits
for National Rifle Association members (Hydock et al. 2020). But firms must
take care to ensure the authenticity of their claims. For example, in response to
the Covid-19 pandemic, Amazon produced an ad campaign thanking its
employees for being heroic in serving customers and highlighting the firm’s
dedication to keeping everyone safe. However, Amazon subsequently faced an
employee backlash and strikes over health and safety, so it seems the firm
many not be ‘walking the talk’ (Alemany 2020). Firms should ensure their
claims are genuine and authentic, to avoid being called out by activists. For
marketing, woke activism is arguably like corporate social responsibility
(CSR), as it prompts firms to regulate business activities in accordance with
achieving societal good. CSR and woke activism are seen as forces of social
impact, and encourage firms to overcome social and environmental issues
(Osorio 2020). While activism centres on driving ‘behavioural and socio￾political change’, and campaigns can be emergent, emotional and highly
controversial, CSR focuses on established societal issues and responds with
corporate-sponsored strategies that address accepted issues (Mukherjee and
Althuizen 2020). Firms must consider their position in terms of the differences
between CSR and woke activism.
These six emerging issues help prompt discussion about the value of the
marketing concept, and together are useful for highlighting how aspects of the
concept are evolving.Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapter Detailed Review
1. Identify the fundamental principles of marketingpage 26
The marketing concept sets out the core ideas that underpin the nature of
marketing and provides central planks on which to build a market-orientated
organization.
Market orientation provides a guiding philosophy that enables an organization to
concentrate its activities on its customers.
Focusing on efficiency and effectiveness enables an organization to
ensure that it is doing things right and doing the right things. Getting
the balance correct between the two can mean the difference between success
and failure.
Customers are at the heart of marketing; consequently, understanding how to
create customer value and satisfaction is very important.
Marketing planning brings marketing into wider business strategy, and developing
marketing planning involves decisions at different levels: strategic, tactical and
implementation.
2. The marketing concept: an understanding of the nature of marketing, its key
components and limitations
The marketing concept is the achievement of corporate goals through meeting and
exceeding customer needs better than the competition.
It exists through exchanges where the objective for all parties in the exchange is to
feel satisfied.
Its key components are customer orientation, integrated effort and goal
achievement (e.g. profits), and discovery and exploitation of latent markets.
There are limitations of marketing to consider: pursuit of customer needs is only
one objective companies should consider as this can lead to focusing on short￾term personal satisfaction rather than longer-term societal welfare; ensuring new
development leads towards innovation rather than dull marketing campaigns and
me-too products; marketing can be intrusive and divisive.
3. Adopting a market orientation in a changing world
Focusing on customer needs identify potential market opportunities, leading to the
creation of products that create customer satisfaction.
Production orientation focuses on production capabilities, which defines the
business mission and the products that are manufactured. These are then sold
aggressively to customers.
4. The differences between market-driven and internally orientated businesses
Customer concern versus convenience.
Know customer choice criteria and match with marketing mix.
Segment by customer differences versus segment by product.
Marketing research versus anecdotes and received wisdom.
Welcome change versus cherish status quo.
Understand competition versus ignore competition.
Marketing spend is an investment versus marketing spend is a luxury.
Innovation rewarded and reluctance to punish failure versus avoidance of
mistakes rewarded and failure to innovate conspicuously punished.
Search for latent markets versus stick with the same.page 27
Recognize the importance of being fast versus satisfied with moving slowly.
Strive for competitive advantage versus happy to be me-too.
Efficiency and effectiveness versus efficiency.
5. The different roles of efficiency and effectiveness in achieving corporate
success
Efficiency is concerned with inputs and outputs. Business processes are managed
to a high standard so that cost per unit of output is low. Its role is to ‘do things
right’–that is, use processes that result in low-cost production.
Effectiveness is concerned with making the correct strategic choice regarding
which products to make for which markets. Its role is to ‘do the right things’s–that
is, make the right products for attractive markets.
6. Explain how to create customer value, satisfaction and loyalty, and build long￾term relationships
Value is created by maximizing perceived benefits (e.g. product or image benefits)
and minimizing perceived sacrifice (e.g. monetary or time costs).
Satisfaction once a product is bought is created by maximizing perceived
performance compared with the customer’s expectations. Customer satisfaction
occurs when perceived performance matches or exceeds expectations.
Loyalty is a response that a customer shows over time. Typically,
customers will return repeatedly to the same supplier if they are
satisfied with the products or services they receive.
Relationship marketing enhances productivity and allows the firm and its
customers to develop cooperation.
7. Marketing planning
Involves developing marketing planning from three perspectives: strategic, tactical
and implementation.
Strategic marketing focuses on using a firm’s resources to leverage competitive
advantage.
Tactical marketing focuses on the deployment of the marketing and service mix,
but also seeks to contribute to developing longer-term customer relationships.
The delivery of marketing is brought about through implementation.
Implementation focuses on actions: who is responsible for various activities, how
the strategy should be carried out, where things will happen and when action will
take place.
8. Limitations and challenges for the marketing concept
Six limitations of marketing are discussed:
1) The marketing concept as an ideology: can lead to a narrow and mechanistic
approach towards marketing.
2) Marketing and society: by pursuing individual rather than societal gains, the
marketing concept can result in benefits for the individual (or firm) with little
regard for the impact on the wider marketing environment and society at large.
3) Marketing as a constraint on innovation: overreliance on customers as a
source of innovation can result in lacklustre innovations.page 28
4) Marketing as a source of dullness: focus on analysing customers and
developing offerings that reflect their needs leads to dull marketing campaigns,
me-too products, copycat promotion and marketplace stagnation.
5) Marketing as an intrusion: in the digital age, the capacity to send frequent and
highly tailored messages has increased, as has the capacity of marketing
messages to interrupt our lives.
6) Activism and authenticity: CSR and woke activism reflect the increasing
attention consumers are paying to societal issues when making choices as to
which products and services to buy. Firms should consider the extent to which
CSR policies, goals and targets might meet more controversial and immediate
demands of activism campaigns.
9. Identify relevant business and research examples, which illustrate the
principles of marketing in a modern organization
This chapter has described marketing and demonstrated how the principles of
marketing can be applied in the modern organization through the use of examples,
marketing insights and case studies at the end of the chapter. For each of the key
concepts, it is possible to identify illustrative examples.
Key Terms
commodity businesses those firms that sell goods and materials that are freely traded,
such as agricultural products (rice, coffee, grain), raw materials, metals
competitive advantage the achievement of superior performance through differentiation
to provide superior customer value or by managing to achieve lowest delivered cost
customer satisfaction the fulfilment of customers’ requirements or needs
customer value perceived benefits minus perceived sacrifice
effectiveness doing the right thing, making the correct strategic choice
efficiency a way of managing business processes to a high standard, usually concerned
with cost reduction; also called ‘doing things right’
exchange the act or process of receiving something from someone by giving something
in return
Four-Ps four key decision areas for marketing: product, price, promotion and place
latent markets markets not yet served by existing products or service offers; they
present opportunities for market-orientated companies
market orientation companies with a market orientation focus on customer needs as the
primary drivers of organizational performance
marketing concept the achievement of corporate goals through meeting and
exceeding customer needs better than the competition
marketing mix a framework for the tactical management of the customer relationship,
including product, place, price, promotion (the Four-Ps); in the case of services, three
other elements to be taken into account are process, people and physical evidence
(to make Seven-Ps)non-commodity businesses those businesses that are involved in facilitating processes
and exchanges, but are not in themselves commodities–for example, when you buy
electricity, a large proportion of the cost is attributed to the network of cables used to
deliver the supply; in the UK, the National Grid owns the electricity transmission
system
place the distribution channels to be used, outlet locations, methods of transportation
price (1) the amount of money paid for a product; (2) the agreed value placed on the
exchange by buyer and seller
product a good or service offered or performed by an organization or individual, which is
capable of satisfying customer needs
service mix an extended framework of tactical management processes focusing
specifically on service delivery and including people, process and physical evidence
touchpoints contact points where customers interact with a firm; contact can occur in
physical and digital situations
woke term used to denote awareness of sensitive social issues, societal injustice, racial
inequality and discrimination

CASE 1THE RIVALRY BETWEEN
COCA-COLA AND PEPSI
Competition in a Changing Marketing Environment
For most companies, owning the number-one brand name in the world (valued at more than
$67 billion by the Interbrand consultancy), having global brand recognition and earning $4.8
billion profits on sales of $21.9 billion a year in 2005 would spell success on a huge scale. But
Coca-Cola is not ‘most companies’. In the face of strong competition and a changing marketing
environment, the fortunes of Coca-Cola turned for the worse during the early 2000s.
Source: Nenov Brothers Images/Shutterstock
Once a Wall Street favourite, Coca-Cola created a global brand by the expert marketing of
something as humble as brown carbonated water laced with caffeine and vegetable extracts.
For decades the company outperformed its arch-rival PepsiCo such that, in early 2000, Coca￾Cola’s market capitalization was $128 billion, almost three times that of PepsiCo, which was
valued at $44 billion. By December 2005, all that had changed: PepsiCo had nudged ahead
with a market capitalization of $98.4 billion against Coca-Cola’s $97.9 billion. For the first time
in the history of the two companies, PepsiCo was valued more highly than its old enemy.
Suddenly, the ‘real thing’ was second best.
Coke’s Problems
Many observers dated Coke’s problems back to the death in 1997 of Roberto Goizueta, its
charismatic and highly successful chief executive, who delivered double-digit annual profit
growth. His success over PepsiCo led him to treat that company with contempt. He once said,page 32
‘As they become less relevant, I don’t need to look at them anymore.’ Shortly after his death,
however, the company’s shares lost a third of their value, and profit growth collapsed to the low
single digits. His successors reigned during a time of bungled takeovers, disastrous product
launches, contamination scares, and constant feuding between factions within the management
and boardroom. A classic illustration of Coke’s problems was the scandal involving the launch
of Dasani, a bottled mineral water that turned out to be distilled tap water. When a harmful
chemical compound, bromate, was found in a batch, the brand was withdrawn in the UK.
However, other people attributed the roots of Coke’s failings to Goizueta’s single-minded
devotion to cola. His philosophy was that nothing could beat the low-cost, high-profit-margin
business of producing syrupy concentrate for bottlers, under licence, to transform into the
world’s favourite drink. While Coca-Cola focused on carbonated colas, PepsiCo diversified
away from sugary fizzy drinks into a powerful portfolio of non-carbonated products. In 1998, it
bought the fruit juice business Tropicana, which it built to be the number-one fruit juice brand in
the US. Three years later it bought Quaker Oats, thereby acquiring the energy drink Gatorade,
which has also been built into a major brand. (Coca-Cola pulled out of the Quaker Oats bidding
war believing the price to be too high.) PepsiCo also owned Aquafina, the leading bottled water
brand in the US. The fruit juice, energy drink and bottled water sectors all experienced double￾digit growth in recent years. PepsiCo continued its acquisition programme with the purchase of
the South Beach Beverage Company, which manufactures the SoBe healthy drinking range,
and has launched SoBe Lifewater, which it claims contains the full recommended daily amount
of vitamin C together with vitamins E and B, and no preservatives or artificial flavourings.
Its bottling partner, Pepsi-Americas, also bought Ardea Beverage Co., which markets the
Nutrisoda range containing amino acids, vitamins, Coenzyme Q10, herbs and minerals. In
contrast to Coke, the culture at PepsiCo was reported to be more dynamic and customer
focused, and less bureaucratic.
Where Coke focused on soft drinks, Pepsi has interests in the snack food business (it bought
the Frito-Lay snack food business in 1965), owning such brands as Doritos, Walkers Crisps,
Quavers, Lay’s Potato Crisps and Wotsits (see Table C1.1). The result was that PepsiCo was
generating about 23 per cent of its worldwide profits from the stagnant carbonated drinks
sector, while Coca-Cola relied on fizzy drinks for 80 per cent of profits. Coca-Cola always
seemed to be playing catch-up, having launched Minute Maid fruit juice to challenge Tropicana,
Dasani to take on Aquafina, and Powerade, an energy drink, following the success of Red Bull
and Gatorade in this sector.

PepsiCo’s diversification programme and its brand-building expertise has made it the world’s
ninth largest food and beverage company; Coke, on the other hand, is market leader in
carbonated drinks (46 per cent versus 26 per cent).
Life since Goizueta has also seen Coke criticized for the fall in its marketing investments,
including advertising and marketing research, in an effort to maintain short-term profits, and a
lack of iconic brand-building advertising. Its culture was also questioned and its high-rise
headquarters building in central Atlanta was known in the industry as ‘the Kremlin’, because of
the political intrigue and bureaucratic culture that pervaded its corridors.
A New Era?
In response to its problems, Coca-Cola brought an ex-employee, Neville Isdell, out of
retirement in 2004 to become chairman and chief executive. One of his first acts was to allocate
an additional $400 million a year to marketing and innovation. This was in recognition of the
under-investment in brands and product development. Emerging markets such as China and
India were also targeted more aggressively. He also briefed advertising agencies around the
world in an attempt to create new iconic campaigns to revive the core brand and reconnect with
consumers. In the face of research that showed the proportion of Americans agreeing that cola
is liked by everyone falling from 56 per cent in 2003 to 44 per cent in 2005, and
those agreeing that the drink was ‘too fattening’ increasing from 48 per cent to 59
per cent, Coke increased its investment in sugar-free brands such as Diet Coke and Sprite
Zero. Sugar-free colas have also been launched, such as Coke Zero Sugar, which comes in
black cans and bottles, and is targeted at calorie-conscious young males who have failed toconnect with Diet Coke, believing it lacks a masculine image. The brand is designed to
compete with Pepsi Max, which is also a diet cola targeted at young men. Overall, marketing
spend for the category doubled. Isdell also oversaw the acquisition of a number of small water
and fruit juice companies in Europe. Isdell resisted the temptation to follow Pepsi with the
acquisition of a snacks company. Instead, his strategy was to focus on building a portfolio of
branded drinks. Following this strategy, Coca-Cola purchased the US firm Energy Brands,
which owns Glacéau, a vitamin-enhanced water brand, and bought a stake of between 10 and
20 per cent of Innocent (increased to more than 90 per cent in 2013), the market leader (68 per
cent) in fruit smoothie drinks in the UK. Innocent has built a reputation for making only natural,
healthy products, and using only socially and environmentally aware products. At the time of the
deal (2009), Innocent operated in the UK, Ireland, France, Scandinavia, Germany and Austria.
Coca-Cola also launched an energy drink, Relentless, aimed at 18- to 40-year-old men.
Meanwhile, PepsiCo has introduced its own labelling system in the US to identify healthier
products, using criteria set by an independent board of health experts. Now 40 per cent of sales
derive from products with the green ‘Smart Spot’ given to healthier brands such as sugar-free
colas and baked rather than fried crisps. Most of its research and development is focused on
healthier products. Sales of Smart Spot products grew at twice the rate of those without the
designation, and account for more than half of Pepsi’s product portfolio.
Continuing its focus on healthy drinks, PepsiCo launched PureVia which uses Stevia, a South
American herb used to create natural sugar substitutes, as a zero-calorie sweetener. It was first
used in flavours in PepsiCo’s water brand SoBe Lifewater. Coca-Cola followed this launch with
its own equivalent, Truvia. PepsiCo has continued its move into healthier fare with yoghurt
drinks, hummus and oatmeal bars.
Both companies have also attempted to arrest the decline in the carbonated soft drinks sector
by launching a flurry of new products such as lime- and cherry-flavoured colas. Nevertheless,
colas have come under attack for their contribution to obesity, with some schools banning the
sale of all carbonated drinks on their premises. In the UK, the introduction of a sugar tax has
caused Coca-Cola to reduce the sugar content of some of its brands, including Sprite, Fanta
and Dr Pepper, although not that of the Coca-Cola brand.
Other ethical controversies have been encroaching upon Coca-Cola’s global hold on the drinks
market. Concern at American foreign policy and anti-American sentiment around the world has
led to the launch of brands such as Mecca Cola to provide an alternative to US colas.
Under Isdell, Coca-Cola achieved steady international sales and profit growth. In 2008, he
returned to retirement and was succeeded by Muhtar Kent, who steadily built sales of Coke’s
brands globally. Falling sales of carbonated drinks in the US have been offset by penetration in
emerging overseas markets such as China, Brazil, Russia and India.
A low-calorie soft drink, Coca-Cola Life, was launched in 2014 to expand its range of low￾calorie offerings. The brand was positioned as being based on natural ingredients (stevia
extract) rather than artificial sweeteners. A new ‘one name brand’ advertising strategy was
launched in 2015, which brought its four cola variants–Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero
and Coca-Cola Life–together rather than advertise them separately, so that consumers could
clearly see the range of colas offered by Coca-Cola. The word ‘Sugar’ was added to the Coca￾Cola Zero brand after research showed that half of consumers did not know that it contained no
sugar. The range was reduced to three in 2017 when, in the face of declining sales, Coca-Cola
Life was removed from the market.
In 2019, Mr Kent was succeeded by James Quincey, who became chairman and chief
executive of the company.page 34
Meanwhile, PepsiCo in 2018 launched the first e-commerce-only brand Drinkfinity, a healthy
squash-like drink that comes in the form of plastic ‘pods’ that are added to water. Consumers
are able to buy the pods, together with a reusable bottle, only on the Drinkfinity.com website.
In 2018, both companies continued their strategies of reducing their reliance on sugary fizzy
drinks, with Coca-Cola purchasing Costa Coffee and Pepsi buying SodaStream in multi-billion￾dollar deals.
During the Covid pandemic in 2021 Pepsi announced the sale of Tropicana and other juice
brands, including Naked, a North American brand, to a French private equity firm. Pepsi cited a
decline in the long-term trend for fruit juices and a valuable contribution to the balance sheet as
reasons for the divestment.
An interesting innovation in the UK conducted by Coca-Cola was the launch of a new London
store in 2022, which the company says is focused on bringing unique experiences to
consumers by way of its physical offerings. The store is the first of its kind in Europe, although
similar stores exist in the US. The store focuses on fashion, particularly streetwear,
in collaboration with designers such as Soho Grit, Herschel and Staple. The store
also has its own bar where drinks such as non-alcoholic ‘mocktails’ are served.
Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi have received criticism in recent years, however, because of their
use of plastics in bottling. For example, in 2020, they were named as two of the top three
companies producing plastic waste.
Questions
1. Before the arrival of Neville Isdell, compare Coca-Cola’s response to the changing
marketing environment to that of PepsiCo.
2. Assess both companies in terms of their level of market orientation at that time.
3. How would you position Coca-Cola and PepsiCo on the efficiency–effectiveness matrix?
Justify your answer.
4. What advantages, if any, does PepsiCo’s greater diversification give the company over
Coca-Cola?
5. Assess Coca-Cola’s ownership of Innocent drinks from the point of view of both companies.
6. What future challenges is Coca-Cola likely to face?

CASE 2H&M AND FAST FASHION
Stefan Persson, chairman of Swedish retailer Hennes & Mauritz (H&M), vividly remembers his
company’s first attempt at international expansion. It was 1976, the year H&M opened its
London store in Oxford Circus. ‘I stood outside trying to lure in customers by handing out Abba
albums,’ he recalls with a wry laugh. Persson, then 29, son of the company’s founder, waited for
the crowds. And waited. ‘I still have most of those albums,’ he says.
But Stefan is not crying over that unsold vinyl. In a slowing global economy, with lacklustre
consumer spending and retailers across Europe struggling to make a profit, H&M’s pre-tax
profits were £1.2 billion (€1.4 billion) in 2021 on sales of £16.1 billion (€19 billion). At current
sales levels, the chain is the second largest apparel retailer in Europe after Zara. This is not just
a store chain; it is a money-making machine. Table C2.1 compares H&M with Gap and Zara, its
closest rivals.

Marketing at H&M
If you stop by its Fifth Avenue location in New York or check out the mothership at the corner of
Regeringsgatan and Hamngatan in Stockholm, it’s easy to see what’s powering H&M’s
success. The prices are as low as the fashion is trendy, turning each location into a temple of
‘cheap chic’. At the Manhattan flagship store, mirrored disco balls hang from the ceiling, and
banks of televisions broadcast videos of the body-pierced, belly-baring pop princesses of the
moment. On a cool afternoon in October, teenage girls in flared jeans and with two-tone hair
mill around the ground floor, hoisting piles of velour hoodies, Indian-print blouses and
patchwork denim skirts–each £16 (€18) or less. (The average price of an H&M item is just £10
(€12).) This is not Gap’s brand of classic casuals or the more grown-up Euro-chic of Zara. It’s
exuberant, it’s over the top and it’s working. ‘Everything is really nice–and cheap,’ says Sabrina
Farhi, 22, as she clutches a suede trench coat she has been eyeing for weeks.page 36
The H&M approach also appeals to Erin Yuill, a 20-year-old part-time employee from New
Jersey, US, who explains, ‘Things go out of style fast. Sometimes, I’ll wear a dress or top a few
times, and that’s it. But I’m still in school and I don’t have a lot of money. For me this is heaven.’
H&M is also shrewdly tailoring its strategy to the US market. In Europe, H&M is more like a
department store, selling a range of merchandise from edgy street fashion to casual basics for
the whole family. Its US stores are geared to younger, more fashion-conscious
females. H&M’s menswear line, a strong seller in Europe, hasn’t proved popular
with the less-fashion-conscious American male. So a number of US outlets have either cut back
the selection or eliminated the line. And while the pricing is cheap, the branding isn’t. H&M
spends a hefty 4 per cent of revenues on marketing.
Behind this stylish image is a company so frugal that you can’t imagine its executives tuning in
to a soft-rock station, let alone getting inside a teenager’s head. Stefan Persson, whose late
father founded the company, looks and talks more like a financier than a merchant prince–a
penny-pinching financier, at that. ‘H&M is run on a shoestring,’ says Nathan Cockrell, a retail
analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. ‘They buy as cheaply as possible and keep
overheads low.’ Fly business class? Only in emergencies. Taking cabs? Definitely frowned
upon.
Source: Sara Sette/Shutterstock
But that gimlet eye is just what a retailer needs to stay on its game–especially the kind of high￾risk game H&M is playing. Not since IKEA set out to conquer the world one modular wall unit at
a time has a Swedish retailer displayed such bold international ambition. H&M is pressing full￾steam ahead on a programme that brought its total number of stores to 4,800 in 75 countries by
the end of 2021–a 12 per cent increase in the past four years. In addition, its online store is
open in 50 countries.
Yet H&M is pursuing the same strategy that has undone a number of rivals. Benetton tried to
become the world’s fashion retailer but retreated after a disastrous experience in the US in the
1980s. Gap, once the hottest chain in the US, has lately been suffering from its relatively slow
reaction time to changing fashion trends and its failure to attract young shoppers.
Nevertheless, Persson and his crew were undaunted. ‘When I joined in 1972, H&M was all
about price,’ he says. ‘Then we added quality fashion to the equation, but everyone said you
could never combine [them] successfully. But we were passionate that we could.’ Persson was
just as passionate that he could apply the H&M formula internationally.page 37
What is that formula, exactly? Treat fashion as if it were a perishable product: keep it fresh and
keep it moving. That means spotting the trends even before the trendoids do, turning the ideas
into affordable clothes, and making the apparel fly off the racks. ‘We hate inventory,’ says
H&M’s head of buying, Karl Gunnar Fagerlin, whose job it is to make sure the merchandise
doesn’t pile up at the company’s warehouses. Not an easy task, considering H&M stores sell
more than 600 million items per year.
Although H&M sells a range of clothing for women, men and children, its cheap-chic formula
goes down particularly well with the 15-to-30 set. Lusting after that Dolce & Gabbana corduroy
trench coat but unwilling to cough up £600 (€680) plus? At £60 (€88), H&M’s version is too
good to pass up. It’s more Lycra than luxe and won’t last for ever. But if you’re trying to keep au
courant, one season is sufficient. ‘At least half my wardrobe comes from H&M,’ says Emma
Mackie, a 19-year-old student from London. ‘It’s really good value for money.’
H&M’s high-fashion, low-price concept distinguishes it from Gap, Inc., with its all-basics-at-all￾price-points, and chains such as bebe and Club Monaco, whose fashions are of the moment
but by no means inexpensive. It offers an alternative for consumers who may be bored with
chinos and cargo pants, but are not able–or willing–to trade up for more fashion. H&M has
seized on the fact that what’s in today will not be in tomorrow. Shoppers at the flagship store
agreed, particularly the younger ones the retailer caters to.
In 2004, H&M commissioned Karl Lagerfeld, Chanel’s designer, to create the limited-edition
Lagerfeld range, which included a £70 (€80) sequinned jacket and cocktail dresses for under
£55 (€62). The range, which was offered in the US and 20 European countries, sold out within
two hours in some stores. This was followed in 2005 by the Stella McCartney collection.
McCartney, the British designer whose clothes normally retail for hundreds and sometimes
thousands of pounds, designed 40 pieces for H&M, including camisoles, skinny jeans and
tailored waistcoats. The average price was £40 (€45) per item, around 15 times cheaper than
her own prices. The limited edition was a resounding success, with customers queuing from as
early as 6.30 a.m. to get first pick of the clothes.
Since then, many other top names have lined up to work with H&M, including Kylie Minogue,
Madonna and Beyoncé. In 2009, Matthew Williamson, who has designed dresses for Sienna
Miller, Keira Knightley and Penélope Cruz, reworked his most popular designs–kaftan dresses,
beaded cardigans and print frocks–for the retailing giant. His designs sold out within hours of
hitting the stores. In 2011 and 2012, H&M ran highly successful collaborations with
the Versace and Marni fashion labels, in 2014 with Alexander Wang, in 2018 with
Moschino and with Iris Apfel in 2022.
H&M has invested heavily in social media to connect with its target audience. Fashion
developments at H&M can be followed on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and
Pinterest, as well as on mobile phone apps for iPhone and Android. Thirty six million fans follow
H&M on Facebook, making it the industry leader, where they can find updates on new products
and promotions. Its growing presence in global markets is supported in China by way of the
Youku and Sina Weibo social network sites and in Russia through VKontakte (VK).
The company has also made strides to improve its sustainability credentials. It launched an
ethical fashion brand called Conscious Collection as part of its drive to become a more
sustainable and ethical fashion retailer. The range is made from ‘green’ materials such as
organic cotton and recycled polyester. Its commitments include using more organic and
sustainable cotton, educating farmers and developing the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, an
initiative aimed at measuring the environmental impact of and labour practices for clothing and
footwear manufacture. However, there is still a long way to go and some of the brand’s claims
about the positive effects of its products on environment are not being well-received and in
some cases fashion items have been found to contribute to pollution, and carbon dioxideemissions. Of the 3 billion garments produced each year, many items are quickly thrown away
by buyers, which brings the notion of sustainable fast fashion into question.
Design at H&M
H&M’s design process is as dynamic as its clothes. The 95-person design group is encouraged
to draw inspiration not from fashion runways but from real life. ‘We travel a lot,’ says designer
Ann-Sofie Johansson, whose trip to Marrakech inspired a host of creations worthy of the
bazaars. ‘You need to get out, look at people, new places. See colours. Smell smells.’ When at
home, Johansson admits to following people off the subway in Stockholm to ask where they
picked up a particular top or unusual scarf. Call it stalking for style’s sake.
The team includes designers from Sweden, the Netherlands, Britain, South Africa and the US.
The average age is 30. Johansson is part of the design group for 15 to 25 year olds, and one
style for the autumn they designed was Bohemian: long crinkled cotton skirts with matching
blouses and sequinned sweaters for a bit of night-time glamour. Johansson was not pushing a
whole look, knowing that H&M’s customers ad-lib, pairing up one of its new off-the-shoulder
chiffon tops with last year’s khaki cargo pants, for instance. The goal is to keep young shoppers
coming in to H&M’s stores on a regular basis, even if they’re spending less than £20 (€23) a
pop. If they get hooked they’ll stay loyal later on, when they become more affluent.
Not all designs are brand new: many are based on proven sellers such as washed denim and
casual skirts, with a slight twist to freshen them up. The trick is striking the right balance
between cutting-edge designs and commercially viable clothes.
To deliver 500 new designs to the stores for a typical season, designers may do twice as many
finished sketches. H&M also has merchandise managers in each country, who talk with
customers about the clothes and accessories on offer. When they travel, buyers and designers
spend time with store managers to find out why certain items in each country have or haven’t
worked. In Stockholm, they stay close to the customers by working regularly in H&M’s stores.
Still, Johansson and her crew won’t chase after every fad: ‘There are some things I could never
wear, no matter how trendy,’ she says. Hot pants are high on that list. It’s safe to say they won’t
be popping up at H&M any time soon.
H&M’s young designers find inspiration in everything from street trends to films to flea markets.
Despite the similarity between haute couture and some of H&M’s trendier pieces, copying the
catwalk is not allowed, swears Margareta van den Bosch, who heads the H&M design team.
‘Whether it’s Donna Karan, Prada or H&M, we all work on the same time frames,’ she says. ‘But
we can add garments during the season.’
In 2022 H&M teamed up with IKEA to create an ideas factory in a UK shopping centre that
aimed to identify, mentor and promote designers and small-scale manufacturers. The first was
opened in a IKEA store in London to provide a meeting place and workplace for designers and
makers to form alliances, generate ideas and be an outlet for selling their creations. Successful
projects will backed by up to £10,000 (€11,730) to help scale up to commercially viable
products, with training and mentoring provided by H&M and IKEA experts.
Cutting Lead Times and Costs and digitization
Working with suppliers, H&M’s 21 local production offices have compressed lead times–the
time it takes for a garment to travel from design table to store floor–to as little as three weeks.
Of first-generation fast fashion retailers only Zara has a faster turnaround. Zara’s parentcompany, Inditex, owns its own production facilities in Spain’s Galicia, in Portugal page 38
and Turkey. In addition, the introduction of its own IT infrastructure Inditex Open
platform is allowing Zara to shrink lead times to a week.
Digital supply chain integration is transforming labour processes and working conditions. Radio
Frequency Identification Tags, Cloud-computing and the use of robots in production and
distribution have enabled restructuring of processes and facilitated even faster to market
delivery times to enable H&M to combat competition from an increasing number of second
generation Ultra fast fashion online retailers, which are delivering new products in under a
week. These brands are using approaches which reduce inventories to a bare minimum as on￾shore on demand supply networks can meet demand at an instant. Digitization is also enabling
H&M and Zara to utilize the benefits of their extensive store networks by introducing
omnichannel services, which means customers and ‘click-and-collect and ‘scan and buy’
(Lopez, Riedler, Kohnen & Futterer, 2021).
H&M’s improved digitized supply network maximizes its ability to speedily churn out more hot
items during any season, while minimizing its fashion faux pas. Every day, the company’s
database provides itemized sales reports by country, store and type of merchandise. Stores are
restocked daily. Items that do not sell are quickly marked down in price to make room for the
next styles. Faster turnaround means higher sales, which helps H&M charge low prices and still
log gross profit margins of 55 per cent.
All major fashion retailers aim for fast turnaround these days, but H&M is one of the few in the
winners’ circle. To keep costs down, the company outsources all manufacturing to a huge
network of 1,500 garment shops located in 21 mostly low-wage countries, primarily Bangladesh
and China. ‘They are constantly shifting production to get the best deal,’ says John Tisell, an
analyst at Enskilda Securities in Stockholm.
Facing a New Reality
H&M is a hugely successful company, but in 2017 it was faced with a new reality: for the first
time in two decades it experienced its first quarterly drop in sales. Central to the problem was
that the company was being squeezed from all sides. Online-only retailers, such as ASOS and
Zalando, which offer free delivery and returns, have grown partly at the expense of H&M, which
has responded by offering free returns if made within 28 days, matching ASOS’s returns policy.
The company also launched a budget fashion range of floral prints in 2022, in response to the
cost of living squeeze brought about by the rise in inflation to more than 10 per cent. Zara has
proven a tough competitor, taking over the number-one position from H&M as the world’s
largest fashion retailer, while Primark has taken sales by offering cheaper clothes.
Questions

It has long been argued that the marketing environment consists of two
dimensions made up of forces and actors that affect a company’s capacity to
operate effectively.
1. The forces shaping the first dimension–the macroenvironment–affect not
only the company but also the actors, the people and the businesses that
trade in the global business environment. These forces should be monitored,
as they can affect the success of a company. But the company has limited
opportunity to resist change brought on by the forces. For example, the
European Central Bank manages the euro, governs national banks across the
EU and adjusts interest rates to control the money supply. An increase in
interest rates will affect national economies and make the cost of borrowing
higher. Companies with loans will incur higher bank charges and pay more
interest, but have limited influence over the setting of the base rate, which
controls interest rates. Traditionally, marketers’ attention has been drawn to
four forces–political/legal, economic, social/cultural and technologicalpage 43
(PEST)–when carrying out a macroenvironmental analysis. However, the
growing importance of ecological/physical environmental forces on
companies has led to the acronym for this analysis being expanded to
PEEST. The macroenvironment shapes the character of the opportunities
and threats facing a company, and these forces are largely outside its
control.
2. The actors shaping the second dimension–the microenvironment–are in the
firm’s immediate environment and influence how it operates in its chosen
markets. The key actors are customers, competitors, distributors and
suppliers, and strategic partners. The company has influence over this
dimension, which can affect the nature of relationships between actors.
Actors will influence the choice of target market, channel relationships,
supply and distribution, and competitive marketing strategy.
Please note coverage of the actors in this chapter acts as a brief
introduction. Actors are examined in greater detail later in the book: in
Chapters 4 and 7, which examine the influence of customers on marketing
decisions; Chapter 5 looks at value through relationships; the supply chain and
distribution channels are covered in Chapter 16; and marketing strategy,
planning and competitive forces in Chapters 17 and 18.
The model of the marketing environment provides a broad framework to
inform marketing managers’ decision-making. However, due to the dynamic
nature of the environment, it is difficult to determine what is
happening and how to respond. Uncertainty can delay exploitation
of emerging opportunities and new markets, but it can also provide
opportunities for agile and flexible firms.
For example, while large established brands may hesitate over new market
opportunities, smaller insurgent brands take risks and respond to opportunities.
For example, Justin’s (organic peanut butter), e.l.f. (affordable beauty
products) and Fever-Tree (quality tonic water and soft drinks) are companies
that have grown rapidly by fulfilling unmet market demands. These smaller,
dynamic and flexible firms challenge established market leaders with high￾quality alternatives (Bain Insights 2018).
The framework of analysis–the market environment–is used to structure
this chapter, which explores the elements of each dimension. After that, we
consider ways to map and monitor the influences and trends that have meaning
for marketing, planning and strategy, since failure to respond to a changing
environment can lead to poor business performance.Technological Forces and the Digital
Revolution
Technological forces are having far-reaching impacts on marketing. Each
generation experiences technological change based around innovations that
fundamentally alter how we live, and can have a significant impact on
marketing practices. Digital technology is changing all aspects of life and how
business is done, the products on offer, how we communicate, and much more.
The rate of change and the speed of adoption of new products, services and
ways of doing things have intensified. For example, the Internet of Things
(IoT) is seamlessly linking digital devices to facilitate the development of
many new products and services. Facebook has developed into a global social
networking platform since its launch in 2004, when Mark Zuckerberg and his
colleagues at Harvard created a means of linking together university students.
Today, more than 4.62 billion people–58 per cent of the world’s population–are
actively using social media. The rapid uptake of new digital technology is
changing how people interact. Nearly 70 per cent of the world’s population
own a mobile phone, and so can communicate, trade and interact via the web
and social media while on the move (We Are Social 2022). The effects of
digital technology on the trading environment are so far-reaching and complex
they are generating opportunities to innovative strategic frameworks in
marketing.
Hoffman et al. (2021) argue digital technologies are changing processes in
marketing and enabling firms to generate better market decision-making (see
Figure 2.2, which shows how digital applications generate rich streams of big
data, with details on every aspect of customer behaviour). New forms of data
capture, video, audio and text, then enable firms to experiment and find the
most effective marketing campaigns e.g. A/B testing (looking at different
executions to find the best version of marketing messaging). This in turn leads
to developing new methods for making decisions and achieving desired
marketing outcomes. This part of the process of analysing customer data,
trialling new marketing applications, and finding the best versions is leading to
better predictions of customer behaviour.
FIGURE 2.2
Digital applications, data and customer decision-makingpage 44
The next stage in the cycle is improved insights into the ways new
technologies deliver benefits and then how the technology can be used to
inform customer and firm decision-making, and, ultimately, better sales
performance, use of resources, and more efficient and effective marketing
strategies. For example, Babylon Health is a firm using artificial intelligence
(AI) to provide medical expertise to people across the planet. The data
generated by the widespread adoption of the service is analysed and is
changing the processes involved in the provision of medical services at local,
national and global levels. New processes and methods are being
developed, giving insights that result in better service provision
through the Babylon app, for example people can ask about a health condition,
talk to a doctor and run a health check (see Exhibit 2.1).

Technology can have a substantial impact on people’s lives and firms’
fortunes. Technological breakthroughs have given us AI, virtual and
augmented reality applications (VT and AR), blockchain robotics, body
scanners, biotechnology, cryptocurrencies, mobile phones, computers and
many other life-changing products and services. Many of these breakthroughs
have changed the rules around competition: the launch of the computer and
word-processing software destroyed the market for typewriters; robots are
replacing humans in many manufacturing and information processes, but have
created markets for intelligent products. Technological change can provide
opportunities for new product development, create new markets, change
marketing practices and communications, reshape cities and revolutionize
society. Marketing-led companies seek not only to monitor technological
trends but also to pioneer technological breakthroughs that can transform
markets and shift competitive advantage in their favour. Innovations and
technology applications are affecting every aspect of modern life–from the
products and services we buy to the cities in which we live. Marketers should
not only look for opportunities (and threats) surrounding their brands but
should also seek to use technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of their marketing operations. Marketers should seek to keep up to date with
technological innovations, changes and trends in the following areas.
Research and development
Technology investments require sound understanding of the market. Marketing
research and development (R&D) staff should work closely together to ensure
investments are purposeful and not just for the sake of technology. A classicpage 45
example of a high-technology initiative driven by technologists rather than by
the market was the turbojet-powered supersonic aircraft Concorde. Although
Concorde was technologically sophisticated, management knew before launch
it never stood a chance of being commercially viable. Development of the
Airbus A380, the world’s biggest passenger plane, has been market-based and
driven by the need for greater passenger comfort on long-haul flights, pressure
to reduce carbon emissions and increasing demand for these flights. But even
this aircraft is struggling to be commercially viable, as there have not been
enough orders (Goldstein 2018).
R&D in new technology can pay handsome dividends and secure market
share. 3M is a firm known for its R&D, and its successes include Post-it notes,
fuel cells, electronic circuits, light management systems, RFID tags, and
recently respirators and healthcare products. R&D investment at 3M is
carefully managed, but during the global pandemic the firm changed its
approach from being inward looking towards a more outward, collaborative
and co-creation model of working. 3M, together with the Ford Motor
Company and Cummings Engines, designed an air-purifying respirator to
improve personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline healthcare workers
caring for Covid-19 patients (Benjamin and Komlos 2020).
Investment, or lack of investment, in high-potential technological areas can
severely affect a company’s fortunes. For example, Sony–once regarded as a
leader in high-tech product innovation–lost ground due to its lack of early
investment in developing flat-screen TV liquid crystal displays, allowing
Samsung to gain a competitive advantage in flat-screen TVs. Finnish
telecommunications firm Nokia has, from its beginnings as a paper mill
founded in 1865, repeatedly found new market opportunities to invest in to
enable it to continue in its mission of creating technology that helps the planet.
In the late 1990s Nokia became the world’s best-selling brand of mobile phone
handsets, but then went through a period of complacency when it failed to
monitor the competition effectively and demand for its handsets collapsed. In
2014 Nokia sold its mobile division to Microsoft. This was not the end,
however, as Nokia invested in becoming a telecoms network hardware and
software provider (Nokia 2022). This investment in network technologies
enabled Nokia to become a leading global player in 5G markets
(Milne 2022). Digital technologies are continually creating
opportunities for firms to develop new products, marketing tools and
techniques.Innovations also occur in business models. Dell was a market innovator
and, reinventing its supply chain, cutting out the middleman to sell direct to its
end customers, creating an advantage over its competitors IBM and Hewlett
Packard, while further R&D in the areas of cloud computing and AI is again
transforming Dell’s fortunes (Bloomberg 2018). Innovations are not limited to
technology companies. During the Covid-19 pandemic, global fast-food brands
had to reinvent their business operations. Chipotle Mexican Grill invested in
drive-through lanes named Chipotlanes to allow customers placing mobile
phone orders to be served quickly without entering the fast-food restaurant
(US Chamber of Commerce 2022) (see Exhibit 2.2).

Information, data management and cyber security
Technology affects how marketing is conducted as developments in
information technology have revolutionized marketing practices. Information
technology describes the broad range of processes and products within the
fields of computing and telecommunications. Accessibility of information has
been used as a source of competitive advantage, and data warehouses are an
important new technology offering firms potential to leverage such advantage
from their information resources effectively. Data warehouses facilitate the
sharing of information and enable information to be accessible at the point of
need. Indeed, research has found that accessibility of strategic information can
facilitate commercial benefits (Doherty and Doig 2011). Using better-qualitypage 46
information, and more insightful analysis managers, can lead to more informed
decisions, save time, and make a greater contribution to corporate and
marketing success.
Information systems and data warehouses are used in many business, and
new areas of market activity have emerged as a result. Software as a Service
(SaaS) defines cloud computing as one such area, where many technology
firms and innovative start-ups operate. Salesforce.com is one of the largest
cloud-based firms, creating connected customer experiences using data
automation to improve the efficiency of sales teams. Slack, a workplace
messaging company, has pioneered new ways of communicating, working and
bringing employees closer to their jobs. DocuSign built a company worth more
than $42 billion by providing a way to securely sign documents over the
internet. Coupa is used by Hilton Hotels to track business spending and is
worth more than $22 billion. Other firms can use these services and, as a
result, SaaS products are opening new markets and reshaping how some firms
operate (Waters 2020).
Developments in data analytics and AI are enabling marketers to use
intelligent personalization to predict consumer demand. Many firms are using
predictive analytics to reposition their brands, improve customer satisfaction
and drive loyalty. Customer relationship management (CRM), also founded on
data technologies, has enabled companies to improve communications and
relationships with customers; this is discussed further in Chapter 5.
Multichannel retailing is underpinned by information and data technology and
is discussed in Chapter 16.
As companies make greater use of individuals’ and firms’ data sources to
develop new products and services, the value of the data grows and the need to
protect data increases. Technology innovations are driving developments in
areas of activity, which in turn increase the need for security in virtual
environments (e.g. IoT, e-commerce trading platforms, AI, SaaS solutions).
The global pandemic also heightened awareness of the need for security as
firms worldwide sent their workforces to work from home, where data and
digital equipment was not necessarily as well protected as in an office
environment (Fortune Business Insights 2022). Now read Hidden Gem 2.1 to
find out more about Darktrace and cyber security.HIDDEN GEM 2.1
Darktrace: Hiding in Plain Sight
Background
Darktrace, a UK-based firm with headquarters in Cambridge, was started by a group of
mathematicians, computer scientists and security defence experts in 2013. Led by Poppy
Gustafsson, Darktrace has enjoyed significant growth, building up a customer base of
6,500+ in diverse industries including airlines, healthcare, governments and retail, in 110
countries, and with more than 1,700 technically skilled employees worldwide. The firm has
been referred to at the UK’s most promising technology start-up and since 2015 has grown
from a market valuation of $80 million to more than $2 billion in 2022.

Products
Darktrace differentiates its product offer by incorporating self-learning AI into its products.
This means the AI applications are constantly learning new patterns of behaviour in digital
network environments, which can then learn and adapt to understand how data are
normally used and accessed. Any deviation from normal patterns of behaviour is
automatically investigated and analysed. So, the products create a continual virtuous loop,
which is seeking to detect, respond, heal and prevent cyber attacks.
Conventional AI applications rely on established data sets and prior company knowledge,
and so do not ‘learn on the job’. Darktrace’s Antigena is filling this gap in the market; it is an
innovative product using autonomous response technology to enable companies to have
proactive cyber defence across all parts of their digital infrastructures. The product works
across cloud networks, SaaS solutions, email servers and internal computer networks to
ensure a reduction in opportunities for hackers and cyber criminals to gain access to
valuable data and information resources.
The marketpage 47
The cyber security market is predicted to grow to over $400 billion by 2029, and the Covid￾19 pandemic has accelerated demand for business security solutions. Firms are seeking
ways to protect e-commerce platforms, wider use of AI, machine learning, cloud services,
data storage and a range of other technology applications, which is also driving the growth
of this emerging market. Customer submarkets can be segmented by business size–large,
and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)–and activity sector (e.g. financial services,
retail, insurance, manufacturing, telecoms, healthcare, travel, transportation).

Communication
Digital technologies have created new forms of interactions. For example,
traditionally, firms would communicate with customers in a one-way direction,
but now it is possible for firms, consumers and other stakeholders to reach out
to one another to engage in a multifaceted dialogue (Hoffman et al. 2021).
Digital and mobile phone technologies enable firms to use new channels of
communication and distribution (e.g. music downloads) to reach customers.
New technology speeds up communications and enables multiple interactions
using various media. In the multichannel world, we communicate and gather
information from multiple points: websites, apps, a multitude of TV channels,
printed publications and, perhaps more importantly, each other. Digital
technologies have completely altered modes of communication, but in
so doing are eroding the boundaries between the message, the media,
the channel and the product. The applications, issues and implications of
digital communications technology are covered in detail in Chapters 12, 13, 14
and 15.
Society, technology and the sharing economy
Society changes, and major events can quicken the rate of change and impact
on the socio-economic environment. Digital technologies are becoming
increasingly important in most sectors of economic activity. The internet has
provided the impetus for many companies to rethink the role of technology and
has also had a significant effect on society. For its users, the internet has not
only provided the means to find, buy and sell products, but has also created anenvironment for building communities where like-minded people can network,
socialize and be entertained. The emergence of social networking sites such as
Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok and WeChat, and microblogging sites
like Twitter has had a significant impact on global society. Social media have
given a voice to masses of individuals, businesses and communities around the
world, and their influence can be powerful. Social media has been used to
communicate, organize protests, and influence politics and governments. It has
also been argued ‘Social media is reshaping human language through the
unprecedented mixing of idioms, dialects, and alphabets’ (Schillinger 2011),
and this is bringing into question whether the technology will have long-term
effects on the way we speak, write and listen. The importance for marketing of
such developments is considered in detail in Chapter 15.
The sharing economy is blurring the lines between macroenvironmental
forces and is another game changer of the digital era. Lyft and Uber
(transportation), Deliveroo (food services), Airbnb (accommodation) and
WeWork (office space) are examples of firms that use digital platforms to
provide services that offer temporary use of resources. Airbnb enables private
renters to allow travellers to book a space in their home rather than a hotel or
lodging house. Uber drivers use their own vehicles and connect directly with
people looking for a ride. In the sharing economy there are resource providers
and resource users, and technology platforms enable these two groups to find
each other and make exchanges, blurring the boundaries between personal and
professional areas of economic and marketing activity (Eckhart et al. 2019).
For further discussion of this topic see Chapter 14 on digital marketing.
Smart cities
Smart cities are the cities of the future. The idea is to create an infrastructure
around technology that makes use of integrated digital technologies and
innovations to provide a seamlessly connected city experience. The current
vision includes robots, driverless cars, cashless payment systems, and items
from street furniture, lamp posts, bike racks and traffic lights, to home
appliances and transport systems, that utilize digital sensors, incorporated into
the fabric of a place, or smart city, to offer a technology-enhanced existence.
The vision offers great potential for marketers but also threats, as existing
services are automated and replaced by new high-tech solutions. Nordic
construction firm NNC is trialling ‘buildbots’ in a major building project in
Helsinki, Finland. These buildbots use AI technology to capture every detail ofpage 48
a construction project and then create a digital replica, allowing NCC to
monitor and review progress. The advantages are accurate reporting, better
building safety compliance, more information for the project customers and
taking errors out of the construction process, reduced build costs and shorter
project delivery times (Geschwindt 2022). However, the use of buildbots can
lead to initial complex contractual arrangements, which can slow the design
and build part of the project and require more negotiation when bringing
together a design and build project team.
Some cities have made significant strides towards becoming smart. In
Songdo, South Korea (Exhibit 2.3), pneumatic tubes take waste direct from
homes, where it is then sorted, recycled and used in energy generation. A
sophisticated water recycling system links to apartments which have heating
and lighting that can be controlled via mobile phone. This part of Seoul was
designed to be an attractive place to live, away from the polluted, crowded
streets of neighbouring districts (Poon 2018).

Economic Forces
Economic forces impact on the success of firms through their effect on supply
and demand, triggered by a combination of interest rates, inflation, growth
rates, disposable income and more. Firms should monitor economic factors tobe aware of the effect on their operations, and should be wary of making
assumptions about the longer term, especially in periods of heightened
volatility and uncertainty. Sudden changes in growth, inflation, interest and/or
exchange rates can quickly alter the economic climate, so contingency plans
are needed to cope with economy-induced upturns and downturns in demand.
Firms need to monitor their national as well as international economic
environment, and identify the opportunities and threats. For example, changing
financial relations in Europe between the UK and EU post-Brexit have
impacted economies at multiple levels.
We will examine four major economic factors influencing the marketing
environment in the UK and Europe: economic growth and unemployment;
interest, exchange rates and inflation; the European Union (EU), the Eurozone
and Brexit; and the growing and emerging economies.
Economic growth and unemployment
The general state of national and international economies can have a profound
effect on a company’s prosperity. Economies tend to fluctuate according to the
business cycle, although more enlightened economic management has reduced
the depth of the contraction in some countries. Many world economies have
gone through a period of growth since the mid-1990s, driven partly by
productivity gains brought about by developments in computing and
telecommunications technologies. This growth was followed by a period of
economic slump, which began in 2008 with a period referred to as the ‘credit
crunch’; this was followed by deepening recession and the Eurozone debt
crisis, which impacted on the worldwide economy. The world economy had
been growing steadily, especially in emerging markets, but in March 2020 the
Covid-19 pandemic caused dramatic economic impacts around the globe, and
for the next two years there was much uncertainty and volatility in global
economies (see Figure 2.3).

During periods of boom, well-managed firms experience an expansion in
the demand for their products, while periods of slump may bring a decline in
sales as consumers become wary of discretionary expenditures. A major
marketing problem is predicting the next boom or slump. Investments made
during periods of high growth can become massive cash drains when
consumer spending suddenly falls. Retailers are often the first to be affected;
Amazon, Carrefour, Tesco and Walmart are only too aware they must plan to
manage their national and international operations in anticipation of rising and
falling consumer demand. Read Mini Case 2.1 to find out what happened when
Covid-19 hit.
MINI CASE 2.1
When Covid Came to Town
Recently, many town and city centres around the world have been struggling to attract
visitors and remain economically sustainable. High streets are often dominated by large
high-street chains, and out-of-town malls located nearby have drawn shoppers away from
urban centres. Transport, access and parking (or rather a lack of availability of these) create
more challenges for shoppers, with the result that town centres have become increasingly
unattractive locations. Decline has not been uniform and different centres have coped withthese challenges in various ways: introducing street markets and seasonal events; creating
pedestrian-only shopping zones; revitalizing the physical attractiveness of high streets
through investment in public realm projects. But the arrival of the coronavirus (Covid-19)
pandemic public health emergency in March 2020 provided new reasons for people not to
go to town to shop (e.g. severe government restrictions with regard to social distancing,
mask wearing and stay at home orders), causing footfall to fall by 57–75 per cent.
Research looking into footfall patterns (Enoch et al. 2021) in six UK town centres showed
while the relaxing of Covid rules had some effect on increasing the rate of recovery in
shopper footfall levels, in other towns many people were reluctant to return to town centre
shopping. In fact four of the towns in the study showed no obvious change in the footfall
gradient as the rules were relaxed. An explanation for this behaviour is ongoing fears of
becoming infected by the virus when mixing with people, discomfort at being required to
wear face masks in enclosed spaces and/or being more comfortable with using online
shopping as an alternative.
Shopper reluctance suggested a slow, drawn-out ‘L’-shaped economic recovery (as can be
seen in the above diagram) from the pandemic rather than a rapid ‘V’-shaped recovery, as
had been hoped for in the early days of the pandemic.
The threat of Covid-19 in the UK, throughout the rest of Europe and around the globe has
continued into 2022, and more lockdowns remain a possibility. So, towns and city shoppers
have had to adapt to a ‘new normal’ and be prepared to handle restrictions as and when
they are applied.
Overall, firms and town centre strategists are considering how to manage their places over
the medium and longer term. For firms, it is essential to understand consumer behaviour in
this new era of shopping and to identify how customers might perceive the new risks
associated with shopping, for example catching Covid-19/meeting someone with Covid-19.
Also they need to assess how further government interventions might impact on customer
accessibility to stores and on their business models (which vary by type of operation). For
instance, a retailer needing a low volume of customers due to selling high-value items (e.g.page 50
jewellery) may be better placed to survive than a shop selling greetings cards, which needs
a regular and high flow of customers.
Meanwhile, operationally, there are issues of how to cope with the cost of implementing
government policy (screens, labelling, one-way systems), how to manage highly fluid
changes (e.g. the application of local and regional lockdowns) and channel management,
most particularly in terms of whether to continue to rely on face to face transactions or to
switch to online. In summary, retailers that survive are likely to be those that are highly
adaptive and that have the financial resources and managerial capabilities that enable them
to do so in a very different retail environment once Covid-19 has been to town.
Town centre managers also need to consider the role of footfall in their future regeneration
strategies and the impact of new patterns of consumer behaviour after Covid-19. For
instance, there could be a refocusing of energies away from relying on large-scale events
such as river festivals and book fairs, and towards other ways of establishing value and
maintaining viability. Given the new focus on social distancing, there is also a clear need for
new (more flexible) approaches in how both indoor and outdoor space is managed and
used. Finally, it also highlights the challenge policy-makers face in persuading citizens to
adjust their behaviour–in this case it proved to be much easier to force people not to go to
town centres than to encourage them to return.
Questions:
1. The Covid-19 pandemic has been described as a once-in-a-lifetime global event.
Discuss why not all shoppers were keen to return to towns to shop once restrictions
were lifted.
2. Suggest how marketers, retailers and town centre managers might overcome
shopper resistance to reinvigorate local town centre economies.
Based on: Enoch et al. (2021)
Within an economy, different sectors experience varying growth rates,
leading to changing degrees of market attractiveness. For firms selling
commodities (raw materials and primary products such as electricity, oil, grain,
precious metals and orange juice) there has been low-level growth, relatively
stable demand and readily available supply, which has meant comparatively
low market volatility. But major global events disrupted supply in 2020: the
global pandemic caused supply chain disruption and economies to come to a
standstill. Silicon, for example, is a commodity used in most digital devices
around the world. Silicon-based semiconductor chips are widely used in
consumer, industrial, transport and healthcare technologies. Covid affectedsupply chains, production and manufacturing as international borders and
factories were closed, which caused major shortages of semi-conductor chips
for everything from mobile phones and cars to medical ventilators. In 2022,
the Russia–Ukraine conflict affected the price of grain. These two countries
produce about 25 per cent of the world’s grain supplies–Ukraine is a major
exporter of corn, wheat and sunflower oil, and Russia is the world’s biggest
exporter of wheat–so the unrest has had a significant impact on this $120
billion market. The supply chains of these valuable commodities were halted,
and grain production disrupted, which resulted in blockages, limited supply
and significantly rising grain commodity prices, which impacts manufactured
food prices, while a significant drop in exports could affect global hunger
(Durisin et al. 2022). See Figure 2.4 for the world’s major wheat producers.
FIGURE 2.4

The services sector has experienced rapid growth in recent years. In the EU
in 2022, services account for more than 73 per cent of gross value added
(GVA) compared with 7 per cent in 2005 (Eurostat 2022a). GVA is a
productivity measure of the value of goods and services.
Low growth rates tend to reflect high unemployment levels, which in turn
affect consumer spending power. The 2008–13 recession caused
unemployment rates to rise and consumer spending to fall in many European
economies, for example in Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Since 2014, the
picture has been improving, with falling unemployment rates across Europe
and, even though the pandemic caused a rise in 2020, by 2022 unemployment
was down to 6.2 per cent (Eurostat 2022b). Covid-19 shocked European
economies and caused uneven economic recovery. Activity sectors (e.g.
leisure, travel and tourism), where personal contact is high, have been slower
to return to pre-pandemic levels than those in manufacturing. Governments
across Europe have invested heavily in employment retention schemes, to
avoid economic collapse (IMF 2022). The UK’s withdrawal from the EU has
affected immigration and migrant workforces, and there are shortfalls in the
supply of truck drivers, seasonal workers and workers in low-paid jobs (Tetlow
and Stojanovic 2018).
Brazil, as an emerging economy, faced difficult economic challenges
relating to Covid-19, across health, society and social care. The country made
progress in poverty reduction, but high Covid death rates have meant
challenges when it comes to protecting the poor while ensuring economic
stability (World Bank 2021a).
China’s economic growth came back strongly after the pandemic in 2020,
but a slowdown caused by a reduction in exports and further outbreaks of new
variants of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 point to further economic
instability (World Bank 2021b).
In India, economic growth is positive, and employment and spending are
on the increase. Strong exports and domestic investment have seen production
increase and overall economic growth (Majumdar 2022).
Interest, exchange rates and inflationpage 52
A key monetary tool governments use to manage economies is interest rates.
Interest rates represent the price borrowers have to pay lenders for the use of
their money over a specified period of time. Most western economies have had
low interest rates to encourage borrowing and lending in an effort to avert a
major slump in consumer and business demand. The European Central Bank
(ECB) has a target interest rate of 2 per cent.
An exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another (e.g. an
exchange rate of £1 = €1.20 means that £1 buys €1.20). Fluctuations in
exchange rates mean the price a consumer in one country pays for a product
and/or the money that a supplier in an overseas country receives for selling
that product can change. For example, if the exchange rate between the pound
sterling and the euro changes, such that a pound buys fewer euros, a German
car manufacturer that receives payment in euros will receive fewer euros if the
price of the car remains unchanged in the UK. In an attempt to maintain a
constant euro price, the German car manufacturer may raise the UK pound
sterling price to UK distributors and consumers. The following example
illustrates these points.
At £1 = €1, a German car manufacturer would receive €10,000 for a
£10,000 car. If the exchange rate changed to £1 = €0.5, the German car
manufacturer’s receipts would fall to €5,000. To maintain euro receipts at
€10,000 the UK price would have to rise to £20,000.
The Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in the European Union seeks to
reduce variability for countries in the Eurozone. However, the rates at which
major currencies such as the US dollar, the euro, the pound sterling and the yen
are traded are still variable. As seen in the example above, this can have
significant implications for sales revenues and hence the profitability of a
firm’s international operations.
Inflation is another economic factor, closely linked to interest rates, which
are used to stabilize an economy. Inflation is a measure of the average price of
goods (typically bought by consumers in a year) and in the UK is tracked by
the Consumer Price Index (Institute for Government 2022). Inflation can have
far-reaching impacts: in 2022, for example, US and UK inflation rates reached
over 7 per cent, a rate not experienced for more than 30 years. In the EU
inflation was 6.2 per cent, in Turkey inflation rose to 48 per cent, in Brazil to10 per cent and Mexico to 7.4 per cent, whereas in China it was 1.5 per cent.
This situation has been compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic, which
contributed to the imbalance in supply and demand. To keep prices in check
and to stop the economy expanding too rapidly, interest rate rises slow things
down but make everything more expensive. Now read Marketing in Action
2.1.
MARKETING IN ACTION 2.1
The Impact of the Cost of Living Crisis
The cost of living affects most individuals’ spending behaviour, and our ability to pay for
food, energy bills and other household expenses. When inflation increases it costs more to
pay for the things we need and so the cost of living goes up. This puts pressure on income,
and workers look for wage rises to pay for their daily needs. If we cannot afford the items,
we need we look to make savings, cut spending and reduce outgoings to manage the
impact of rising inflation and interest rate raises, which can cause the economy to slow
down. A cost of living crisis refers to a real drop in household incomes. According to the
ONS (2022), inflation is likely to impact more on poorer households as they have less
flexibility in their household budgets than higher income households, which are more able to
absorb higher prices for foods and energy bills. In such economic circumstances, when
consumer confidence starts to wane shoppers spend less on going out, purchasing major
items, holidays and subscriptions (Jefferson 2022). So, marketers should consider their
options. At fashion brand Weird Fish, a marketing decision was made to freeze the prices of
its summer ranges to help support its loyal customer base, in an attempt to encourage
shoppers to continue to spend (Nazir 2022). To help maintain prices, UK supermarket
retailers from Tesco to Sainsbury’s and Asda cut back on staffing costs by removing fresh
food and meat counters, which carry higher-priced food items, to concentrate on more
profitable areas of their stores. Other cost-cutting initiatives include increased use of self￾scanning payment systems for shoppers, and automation of warehouses and stockrooms
(Butler 2022).page 53

The EU, the Eurozone and Brexit
The EU is a massive–largely deregulated–market, and it has far-reaching
implications for marketing, as the barriers to the free flow of goods, services,
capital and people among the member states are removed. A key objective of
the EU is to lower the costs of operating throughout Europe and to create an
enormous free market in which companies can flourish. As we have already
seen, competition is encouraged through the enactment and enforcement of
laws designed to remove restrictive practices and other competitive activities.
The EU currently consists of 27 member states, and it is continually
expanding. Table 2.1 shows the spread of the current member states and when
they joined.

As the EU has expanded, new member states have contributed to the
development of the community and economic growth of the union. Expansion
to include eastern European countries has brought a low-cost, technically
skilled workforce that has proved to be competitive with those in China and
India. The strengths of the economies of member states have been boosted by
EU membership and have led to considerable inward investment–for example,
the Korean firm LG Electronics, which is one of the world’s largest producers
of TVs, committed to investing US$110 million to build a plant in Poland to
produce plasma LCD TVs and batteries for electric cars (Gottig 2017).
The Eurozone is an economic and monetary union between 19 of the
member states of the EU. Each state has adopted the euro (€) as a common
currency, which is managed and controlled by the European Central Bank
(ECB). A primary responsibility of the ECB is to control inflation and interest
rates, and manage debt and economic reforms. It has a target interest rate of 2
per cent. A common currency brings advantages through facilitating the flow
of free trade within the community. However, turbulence in economic markets
has exposed weaknesses in areas of the Eurozone, which potentially have far￾reaching implications for economies around the world.
Brexit, which refers to the vote by citizens of the UK in the referendum
held on 23 March 2016 to leave the EU, has caused disruption. The UK left the
EU on 31 January 2020. The total economic impact on the UK and the 27
remaining member states is unclear, but according to Tetlow and Stojanovic
(2018) areas of change include:
Trade, which relies on overseas buyers exchanging goods and services.
Prices are affected by transport costs, tariffs (imposed on import/export
goods) and non-trade barriers, for example product standards, which vary
from country to country. The benefit of countries being part of the EU is
that, over time, agreements have been reached for all EU members. Trade inpage 54
the Eurozone has largely recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, but the
UK has had a more varied recovery now it is outside the EU: its economy
was up in 2020 but fell back in 2021. And exporting to the EU has become
more complex, which has pushed up costs for UK firms, especially small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Furthermore, supply chains are
affected as countries tend to trade with their neighbours, as there are benefits
in transport costs, similarities in demand and strong linkages for movement
of goods. For the UK, 50 per cent of its imports came from the EU and 47
per cent of exports went back to the EU in 2019. But Brexit has pushed up
the cost of this trade (Flach 2022).
Foreign direct investment (FDI), which is important for long-term economic
growth. The UK is one of the biggest beneficiaries of FDI, as more than 42
per cent of FDI comes from other EU countries. Leaving the EU means the
UK is less attractive for this form of investment, because, as a member, the
UK benefited from free movement of capital, relatively frictionless trade
between member states, and common regulations for the movement of
goods across established complex supply chains within Europe. Leaving the
EU has meant new customer regulations, border controls and procedures for
UK firms.
Regulations, which determine how domestic firms can use their workforce,
capital and technology resources. The UK leaving the EU has meant there is
no longer free movement of services and people. If a UK citizen wishes to
join the EU workforce, and vice versa, they will have to apply for a work
visa if they wish to work.
Currency valuations, since the value of sterling–which is not part of the
Eurozone–floats against the euro and other international currencies, a
weaker pound puts pressure on the price of imported goods, and consumers
experience higher prices on the high street for some goods. On a positive
note, exports from the UK are cheaper, which makes it easier to sell goods
overseas in these circumstances. Global events impact on currency
valuations (not just Brexit), for example the UK’s handling of the Covid-19
pandemic and the rapid roll-out of its nationwide vaccination
programme had a positive effect on the value of the pound against
the US dollar and the euro. However, the UK economy is still to recover
fully from the pandemic and this is holding down the value of the pound
against other currencies.
Growing and emerging economiesEmerging regions of the global economy are growing in importance, opening
markets to new consumers, providing sources of skilled labour and creating
opportunities for new companies to become significant global players. It is
predicted, by 2025, seven out of ten new large companies will be based in
these regions. But while there are significant opportunities in emerging
markets, there is also increased risk–as you will discover when reading more
about emerging economies, below. By 2040, Asia is predicted to account for
50 per cent of global GDP and 40 per cent of world consumption of goods, and
this is causing a shift from west to east (Tonby et al. 2019). Exhibit 2.4
illustrates the shift of economic activity towards Southeast Asia.
EXHIBIT 2.4
The McKinsey world economic centre of gravity
Asia: China, India and South Korea
The economies of both China and India are growing at high and consistent
rates. Both nations possess considerable strengths in low-cost labour, but
increasingly also in technical and managerial skills. China possesses strengths
in mass manufacturing and is currently building massive electronics and heavypage 55
industrial factories. India, on the other hand, is an emerging power in the
software, design, services and precision industries. These complementary skills
are persuading multinational firms to have products built in China with
software and circuitry designed in India. Both countries are enjoying growth in
production and more consumption of manufactured goods by domestic
consumers, which means they are less reliant on expensive foreign imports.
China and India not only pose threats to western companies, they also
provide opportunities for international firms. Chinese consumers are spending
their growing incomes on all manner of consumer durables, from cars to
shampoo. The Chinese buy more cars than the Americans (13.5 million
compared with 11.6 million), and western brands are becoming
increasingly popular–from Burberry to Tesco, Bosch, Nestlé and
Procter & Gamble–as well as healthcare and entertainment brands (Hancock
2018).
However, companies wishing to expand in these booming markets must do
adequate research, as it is important to get things right. Marks & Spencer made
a mistake in opening its stores in China, as it filled its rails with clothes of the
wrong sizes. Chinese women are smaller and slimmer than European women
and have smaller feet. In fact, many Chinese students studying in the UK buy
their shoes in children’s shoe shops (Muller 2011).
In India, the economy is growing at a faster rate than in China, with
manufacturing and construction industries making a significant contribution
(Lyengar 2018). Consumer markets are also growing rapidly. In India, Nestlé
operates factories making many dairy products and chocolates, while
Hindustan Unilever is another European firm taking opportunities in India to
create competitive advantage. In India, preferences for soap and shampoo vary
much less than people’s taste in food, so Unilever is doing even better than
Nestlé, with an 18 per cent increase in profits.
China’s and India’s economies are not just booming in the physical world
but are also rapidly expanding online and in mobile markets. Read Marketing
in Action 2.2 to find out more about online shopping and social networks in
China.
MARKETING IN ACTION 2.2
China: The Greatest Connected Market in the World?Ten years ago, fewer than 3 per cent of the Chinese population were online (about 33.7
million people). China’s online economy now accounts for nearly 8 per cent of national GDP
and is aiming for this to be 10 per cent by 2025. Around 80 per cent of adults in China’s
largest cities regularly shop online, and it is predicted individual consumer spending is
increasing to around the equivalent of $1,000 a year. The boom is being driven by the
Chinese government, which is heavily subsidizing the roll-out of high-speed internet access,
and, surprisingly, by the inefficiency of existing bricks-and-mortar retailers. Many shoppers
go online because they cannot find goods in stores.

Alibaba is an online firm and part of China’s growing digital economy. According to founder
Jack Ma, ‘In other countries, e-commerce is a way to shop, in China it is a lifestyle’, and
Alibaba has become the largest e-commerce company in the world, generating most of its
profits from advertising revenues.
As well as shopping, the Chinese have taken to socializing and sharing information online;
shoppers are fearful of being tricked by fraudsters, so they like to share their experiences.
According to research, more than 40 per cent of online shoppers read and post product
reviews. Social networking, like e-commerce, started slowly, but there are now three large
social networks in China: QQ, Weibo and RenRen. Weibo is the Chinese equivalent of
Twitter, and its top stars have more fans than their celebrity counterparts on Twitter. Also,
there are more than 200 million people with a social network account. Facebook, Twitter
and YouTube are banned in China, which has created an opportunity for these home-grown
networks to emerge. Furthermore, Chinese society is being changed extensively by the
internet. Traditionally, families were reluctant to socialize with those outside their known
circle of close friends and family, tending to be shy and reserved. However, families now
use social networks to organize holidays and find families with similar interests from distant
towns, arranging to meet, share car journeys and lots more.
Based on: Muller (2011); Stanley and Ritacca (2014); Economist (2017); Chaffey and Ellis￾Chadwick (2022); Reuters (2022)
India’s mobile phone industry is second only to that of China. India
produced more than 161 million smartphones in 2021–a 7 per cent annual
growth rate. Adoption of 5G networks is driving growth, as is consumerpage 56
demand for handsets with additional features, better battery life and faster
processors (Anand 2022). India has more than 1.2 billion active mobile phone
subscribers (including 750 million smartphone users). Greater use
of online channels and internet-enabled devices providing access
to financial, health and educational services in more rural areas is also
expanding the market (Business Standard 2022). Indian telecoms company
Reliance Jio is the main mobile network operator in India, bringing phone
access to everyone regardless of where they live. Bharti Airtel is the second￾largest network provider. In 2017, British mobile phone operator Vodafone
merged with India’s Idea Cellular to form Vodafone Idea, which in turn merged
with Aditya Birla in 2018 to form the country’s largest telecom operator; it has
since developed its mobile provision in India and significantly grown its
market share. It can be challenging for international competitors trying to
operate in or enter the mobile market in India; there are profits to be made,
even though massive investment is required to improve network operations
and services. Vodafone invested £1 billion into the aforesaid Indian merger
(Thoppil 2018).
There are also major cultural and logistical barriers to overcome, although
this applies to both online and offline markets. The retail industry in both
China and India is underdeveloped. There are potentially big opportunities for
western retailers (especially supermarkets) to enter Asian markets. However, in
the Indian subcontinent, ‘there are 20 officially recognized languages, 14 main
types of cuisines and countless religious and ethnic festivals as well as a
passion for cricket’ (Economist 2011), which presents enormous challenges
when developing a national retail operation. Western companies need to
understand the importance of culture in both India and China if they are to
succeed. In China, guanxi networks are important. Guanxi is a set of personal
relationships/connections on which a person can draw to obtain resources or an
advantage when doing business. Guanxi is one reason why working with a
Chinese partner is usually better than going it alone. When entering into
business relationships, the Chinese seek stability and trust more than intimacy.
They want to feel comfortable that western companies will not spring surprises
that may hurt them, but they do not need to feel they are a company’s best
friend. It is claimed that the failure of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp to
penetrate China was largely because the company did not spend enough time
and effort on building guanxi.
South Korea is an emerging market, its turbulent political history and
poverty held the country back for many decades, but it has emerged to becomea leading global economy worth more than $1.6 trillion. Key activity areas are
services and industrials, with some agriculture, which is dependent on
government subsidies. This nation has developed a highly effective business
culture, which is innovative and friendly towards foreign investment. South
Korea’s largest industries are electronics, cars, telecommunications and
shipbuilding, and it is home to globally recognized brands such as Samsung
Electronics, Hyundai and Kia (Bajpai and Hvilhaug 2021). Exports have been
a main driver of economic growth at over $55 billion, with cars, ships and
vehicle components being among the most popular items going to China, the
US, Vietnam and other parts of Asia (OEC 2022).
South America: Brazil and Mexico
Brazil’s economy had been seen as one of the strongest in the region and the
country contributed to global growth. Hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2014
and the Summer Olympic Games in 2016 were symbols of the country’s
economic achievements. But recovery from a recession in 2016 is slow, and
corruption, international sanctions and political instability have hampered
business growth and opportunities. Nevertheless, Brazil remains the eighth
largest economy globally (World Facts Book 2022). Brazil’s industry is linked
to agribusiness and other primary products. Its main outputs are sugar, steel,
oil and iron ore. It also has an important technological sector that ranges from
submarines to aircraft, and is involved in space research. Its economy has
benefited from high levels of foreign investment by such companies as Procter
& Gamble, IBM, Ford, DuPont, Anheuser-Busch, InBev and PepsiCo. Among
its largest companies are Petrobras (energy) and Vale (material), Itaú Unibanco
Holding (finance) and BRF–Brazil Foods (consumables). The country is also a
major producer of ethanol, a sugar-based biofuel. Foreign direct investment
has slowed significantly since 2011, but Brazil remains an attractive market for
international investors as its domestic market has 210 million people, and the
country has many natural resources and raw materials that are easy to extract.
Mexico, a developing nation, is trading in global markets and increasing
foreign exports, which allows the country to be classified as an emerging
economy. Its economic growth rate is strong, but it is the pace of development
that suggests its future economic performance. Mexico is developing trade
deals with the US and Canada, and has a strong manufacturing industry. Even
so, poverty remains a big problem, so there is scope to improve on the Humanpage 57
Development Index, which measures social and economic development (Reiff
and Munichello 2021).
Political and Legal Forces
Political forces are complex, interrelated with legal and economic forces, and
it can be difficult to determine their overall impact, but it is important to
recognize governments’ powerful influence over the stability and prosperity of
nations.
Political factors with implications for marketing are as diverse as tax
policies, government regulations on employment, health and safety,
competition regulation, threats to national security, climate change, gender
equality and personal privacy. We examine four key areas: politics and the
economy; regulation, political stability; responding to risk factors.
Politics and the economy
Government orientation and ideology dictate the economics of a country, for
example a largely socialist society (e.g. China, Vietnam) will have greater
intervention from its government, whereas a largely capitalist society will lean
towards private ownership and free markets (e.g. UK, US, Canada). Whatever
the political orientation, it is the responsibility of governments to manage the
national economy. This will usually involve taxation, and other monetary tools
like interest rates (discussed in the previous section). Changes in the price of
goods lead to changes in household expenditure, and taxes impact on the
amount paid. Now read Marketing in Action 2.3.
MARKETING IN ACTION 2.3
VAT Taxes the WorldSource: Bakhtiar Zein/Shutterstock
Value Added Tax (VAT) or Goods and Service Tax (GST) is a tax paid by firms and citizens
in most countries around the world. VAT/GST is a tax paid on goods and services, and is
effectively an indirect levy on consumption. The amount of tax paid depends on the ‘value
added’ at each stage of production until the item or service reaches the end consumer.
Some goods are exempt from VAT/GST, for example second-hand goods (as the tax has
already been paid by the original end user), insurance and education training. Such
exceptions vary by country, as do the reduced rates that apply (see Table 2.2).
TABLE 2.2 Varying rates of standard VAT and reduced rates in selected European
countries
Austria 20% 10/13%
Belgium 21%  6/12%
France 20% 5.5/10%
Netherlands 21%   9%
Poland 23% 5/8 %
Sweden 25%  6/12%
UK 20%   5%
Taking the example of the purchase in the UK of a pair of socks, payment of VAT is shared
thus:
end user pays £12.00
retailer pays £2.00 (20 per cent of the final purchase price) but claims back 60p (20 per
cent of the price paid to the supplier for the socks which cost £3.60); so the retailer’s
total payment to the VAT office is £1.40; the supplier will make similar calculations whenpage 58
paying the manufacturer, who will also have paid VAT on the raw materials used to
manufacture the socks.
VAT is a tax that impacts on the price of goods and services. During the Covid-19 pandemic
the UK Government reduced the rate paid to 5 per cent in the hospitality sector, to help
businesses struggling from the effects of lockdowns and social distancing measures, which
had reduced the capacity of most bars, restaurants, hotel accommodation and more. As
soon as the pandemic was deemed to be over, VAT returned to the 20 per cent rate. This
was a relatively short-term application of VAT rate variation to impact on the economy.
In 2022 the EU set about modernizing VAT rules for a longer-term impact. Member states
are being given more flexibility in the rates they have to charge (at least 15 per cent),
creating more opportunities for applying reduced rates (at least 5 per cent). Furthermore,
member states can set zero rates in healthcare systems, to support health and well-being of
EU societies and the sale of environmentally friendly goods like solar panels, electric bikes,
and waste and recycling services.
Whether VAT rates are varied in the long or short term, it is an important tax for politicians,
citizens and the economy.
Based on: Asen (2021); Baker McKenzie (2022)
The EU is constantly looking at political and economic governances and
has themes it wishes to focus on for future investment strategies, such as
inclusion, green and digital transition. The EU wants to ensure recovery from
the pandemic and resilience to risk and uncertainty in the macroenvironment.
Once its strategies are agreed, investment and support will be made available
and there will be opportunities for firms able to meet the EU’s political aims
(De Angelis et al. 2022).
Equal participation is also central to political decision-making in the UK,
meaning, whatever a person’s gender, they should be able to engage fully in
daily life on an equal footing. However, ensuring this is the case can mean
making changes to overturn engrained attitudes and stereotyping. UK retailer
John Lewis Partnership launched a range of gender-neutral children’s clothing;
it said labels on its own-brand ranges would not say ‘boys’ or ‘girls’ and there
would be no binary division in the merchandising of these garments (Pearson
2017).
RegulationGovernments tend to intervene in market activities to correct market failures,
and to prevent future negative impacts on society (Jean Kwon 2013). There are
many areas of regulation, which are usually the implementation of a particular
law (see the next section for further discussion). For example:
Minimum wage regulations are controlled in the UK under the National
Minimum Wage Act 1998. Under these regulations, amendments can be
made to the rates paid to workers without changing the legal act. These
regulations are important as they protect workers and specify the minimum
amount they can be paid for each hour they work. The regulations determine
the rate paid depending on age. The National Living Wage applies (over the
age of 23), which is based on the cost of living. The UK Government
introduced this to reduce reliance on government subsidy via the benefit
system (UK Government 2022). Many firms pay the living wage as they
believe their staff deserve to be able to afford to live and work (Living Wage
Foundation 2022). In 2021, the EU drafted a new minimum wage law to
ensure all its citizens receive wages that afford them a decent standard of
living (De Boer 2021).
Antitrust regulation aims to ensure companies can compete effectively. The
EU Commission has rules that prohibit firms making agreements that might
restrict competition, and also prohibit a firm from holding a dominant
market position, which might lead to unfair pricing or control over
production, or might stifle innovation (EU Commission 2022). In the UK,
the Competition Act 1998 follows similar regulations. Alphabet Inc.
(Google’s parent company) was fined $2.8 billion when a ruling by EU
legislators found the firm guilty of giving preferential treatment to its own
online shopping services (Santariano 2021).
There are regulatory bodies in every area of public social activity, from
healthcare and the prison service to gambling and food standards. Firms should
be aware of the regulations and standards that apply to the markets they trade
in. There are also regulatory bodies, which control the behaviour of firms in
specific industries, for example in the UK the Financial Conduct Authority
(FCA) is a regulator for the financial services industry, the Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA) regulates civil aviation in the UK and the Advertising
Standards Authority (ASA) is a self-regulatory organization that oversees the
communications industry. For example, promotional marketing campaigns
using prize draws must ensure a random process is used to select the winner,
so when Bellatricks Limited ran an Instagram Stories competition and was
challenged by participants over the fairness of the selection process, it waspage 59
discovered by the ASA that a member of staff had selected the winner by
scrolling through Instagram posts. The ASA found Bellatricks
Limited had breached the CAP code (the UK Code of Non￾broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing) and the firm was
asked to ensure compliance for future campaigns (ASA 2021). There is further
discussion of advertising and regulations in Chapters 12 and 13 (see Exhibit
2.5).

Stability
Political stability affects the appeal of markets, especially with regard to
financial investment and development in new and emerging markets.
Uncertainty and unrest will not be a good condition for economic growth as
financial crashes often result. For example, in 2008 far-right political thinking
gained ground as bank bailouts, public debt and austerity measures had taken
hold and increased public feelings of inequality in society. The financial crash
that followed led to political polarization, making it more difficult for
governments to control their nations, and recovery took many years (Funke et
al. 2018). More recently, the Covid-19 pandemic destabilized economies and
stock markets around the world. The FTSE (UK), Dow Jones Industrial
Average (USA) and Nikkei (Japan) collapsed, with dramatic falls in the value
of shares in March 2020 (Jones et al. 2021). The subsequent responses ofgovernments to the pandemic had major economic impacts. In the UK, a
furlough scheme was developed to help retain workers, across all industries
(e.g. retail and manufacturing), with the government effectively paying the
wage bill for the majority of UK private firms as it sought to protect the future
of the economy between March 2020 and September 2021 (Clark 2021).
Marketers are unlikely to include a global pandemic in their regular
monitoring and analysis of the macroenvironment, but should be prepared for
the unexpected, be flexible and able to respond to dramatic events, and have
sufficient resources and capability to continue in unstable times. Global
pharmaceuticals manufacturer AstraZeneca responded almost immediately to
the situation by revising its partnership agreements, investing heavily in
vaccine production and committing to make millions of doses of coronavirus
vaccine available to the world (AstraZeneca 2020).
Responding to risk factors
Global warming and the politics of climate change are a source of regular
action and debate. Scientists, environmental agencies, charities and activists
support strong interventions to abate the effects of the changing environment
as the risks of not responding are becoming too great. In November 2021,
world leaders and politicians came together at the UN Climate Change
Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, a global summit on addressing
the impact of climate change. The 200 nations represented reached agreement
on the Glasgow Climate Pact, which sets out how to tackle climate change,
and the Paris Rulebook, which provides greater transparency, common time
frames for emissions reductions, and standards for international carbon
markets (Carver 2022). For businesses, climate policies can mean adapting the
manufacturing process, and can require significant investment and adjustment
to how products are made. But there are also opportunities to develop products
that are sustainable: Allbirds is a US-based footwear brand that uses sugar
cane, eucalyptus pulp and wool in the making of its trainers; Neste is a Finnish
company producing diesel from 100 per cent renewable raw materials, which
can cut carbon emissions by up to 90 per cent compared with fossil fuels.
Legal forces
Legal factors involve laws, licences, permits and intellectual property rights,
which control how firms and individuals should behave and can influencepage 60
marketing decisions by setting the rules by which business is conducted. For
example, smoking bans in public places can have dramatic short- and long￾term effects on the demand for cigarettes and on opportunities for introducing
new products such as e-cigarettes, which are changing people’s behaviour
(from smoking to vaping).
The UK legal system
The UK has separate legal systems (jurisdictions) for England and Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. Laws set out the rules and responsibilities, and
cover all areas of economic and social activity. Firms operating in the UK
should comply with laws relating to the firm, its operations and employment of
workers. They should also comply with laws affecting trading, for example
consumer law, product and services standards, intellectual property,
competition law, importing and exporting. Details of laws in each jurisdiction
of the UK should be considered. Firms that are unaware of or break these laws
can suffer considerable financial and reputational damage.
EU-wide laws
EU laws exist at two levels:
1. those that are binding on all member states
2. those that are enactments of a law within the member state.
A major influence at the European level is EU competition, based on the
belief that business competitiveness benefits from intense competition. The
role of competition policy, therefore, is to encourage competition in the EU by
removing restrictive practices, barriers to competition and other
anticompetitive activities. For further detailed discussion of the impact of
competition, see Chapter 18.
The objectives of these legal rules are the prevention of:
Collusion by price fixing, cartels and other collaborative activities.
Competition is encouraged by preventing firms joining forces to act in a
monopolistic way. The European Commission enforces EU rules and has
had considerable success in disbanding and fining cartels. British Airwayswas fined £270 million for conspiring with Virgin Atlantic (which escaped
prosecution because it alerted the regulators to the price fixing) to fix the
price of passenger fuel surcharges on transatlantic flights (Milmo 2008).
Some of Europe’s biggest truck makers (DAF, Daimler, Scania, Volvo) have
been accused of operating a cartel for over 14 years that has potentially held
up developments in emissions-reducing technology; Volvo had made
provision of $490 million for the likely legal action (Sharman 2014). The
European Commission has succeeded in punishing firms that collude, often
with severe fines.
Abuse of market dominance. Monopoly and discriminatory pricing, which
could harm small buyers with little bargaining power, is discouraged.
Facebook was accused of violating German law by abusing its dominant
market position over the collection and processing of user data and
subsequently having a negative effect on online advertising. The High Court
ruled Facebook should stop collecting user data in this manner (Witting
2020). Systembolaget is an interesting example of a state-run monopoly: it
controls the retail sales of alcohol in Sweden. In 2007, the European Court
of Justice ruled against the Swedish regulations and declared that these
policies were inhibiting free movement of goods. The ruling opened
opportunities for direct importing by private consumers, which in turn
stimulated the growth in online alcohol retailers. However, this has led to
further challenges for Systembolaget, as Swedish food retailer City Gross
has teamed up with Danish wine seller Winefinder, thereby creating a legal
loophole for retailers and Swedish wine drinkers (Nilsson 2014).
Acquisition of excessive market power. The objective is to control the size
that firms grow to through buying or merging with other firms. Actions to
prevent the build-up of excess power include blocking mergers, as in the
case of the Swedish truck and coach builder Volvo, which wanted to acquire
Scania. The reason for blocking in this case was that such a merger would
create a near monopoly. Less severe action is to apply strict conditions to
any merger, such as the requirement that Nestlé sell several Perrier brands to
encourage a third force to emerge in the French mineral water market to
compete with Nestlé and BSN, the second major supplier of bottled water in
France.
Reliance on state aid. It can be in a nation’s interest for its government to
give state aid to ailing firms within its boundaries; on a broader scale this
can give artificial competitive advantages to recipient firms, enabling them
to charge lower prices than their unsupported rivals; recipients may also bepage 61
unfairly shielded from the full force of the competitive pressures affecting
their markets. European Commission approval of state aid is usually given
as part of a restructuring or rescue package for ailing firms. The general
principle is that such payments should be one-offs to prevent uncompetitive
firms being repeatedly bailed out by their governments.
MARKETING IN ACTION 2.4
The GDPR and Brexit
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a Europe-wide set of legally binding
principles that govern data protection. The GDPR became law across the EU on 25 May
2018. The legislation seeks to protect personal privacy, so is highly relevant to marketers
wanting to gather data on their customers. Since leaving the EU the UK has been
reclassified as a ‘third country’ and the EU GDPR legislation no longer applies there.
However, the principles of the GDPR were incorporated into the new UK-GDPR Data
Protection Act, so the UK is still in accord with the European legislation. The GDPR targets
the use and storage of data in the digital age, and controls the processing and movement of
this data; misuse of data is a criminal offence. Following Brexit, marketers must be aware of
the reach of their campaigns and, if crossing international borders, ensure they comply with
international transfer of personal data across boundaries. This is particularly relevant for
service-based virtual firms. Information breaches by Yahoo!, LinkedIn and Facebook have
seen unauthorized access to personal data occur. Post-GDPR, companies must report such
losses of personal data to an appropriate national data regulator.
What is the GDPR?
The legislation states:
‘The principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of their personal data should, whatever their nationality or residence,
respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their right to the
protection of personal data. This Regulation is intended to contribute to the
accomplishment of an area of freedom, security and justice and of an economic
union, to economic and social progress, to the strengthening and the convergence
of the economies within the internal market, and to the well-being of natural
persons.’
The reasoning behind this legislation and its being Europe-wide is to ensure there is a
single law protecting citizens. The legislation has 99 articles, which set out the rights of
individuals and the obligations placed on organizations.
What does the GDPR mean for me?page 62
Individuals have eight rights:
1. The right to be informed
2. The right of access
3. The right to rectification
4. The right to erasure
5. The right to restrict processing
6. The right to data portability
7. The right to object
8. Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling
These rights mean that the individual has greater rights–which also places more
responsibility on the company holding the data–as they can ask to see the data held and
can ask for data to be erased. Failure to comply can result in large fines for the companies
involved.
Accountability and compliance for companies
All types of companies must comply, and there are significant implications regarding holding
and using personal information for marketing and other purposes.
More specifically, companies are accountable for handling personal information, must put in
place data protection policies and data protection impact assessments, and must document
how data are collected and managed. Companies with more than 250 employees must also
be able to explain why personal information is collected and describe the type of
information, where it is kept and the security measures that are in place. Systematic
monitoring of people’s data must be carried out, and large-scale processing of sensitive
data should be carried out only by a data protection officer.
What does the GDPR mean for marketers?
Marketers must demonstrate that they are holding personal data lawfully and are using data
only for permitted purposes. Personal data comprises name, a unique identification number,
personal location data, an online identifier, and personal preferences relating to
physical, physiological, economic, cultural or social identity. A marketer must
have an individual’s consent to gather and use such data. Many websites have been
updated to comply with the GDPR and require site visitors to accept terms before they can
proceed to view online content.

Legal and Regulatory Responses to
Ethical Issues in Marketing
The UK and countries across Europe are bound by several layers of laws, and
by regulatory bodies restricting firms’ and organizations’ actions and
encouraging the use of ethical practices.UK and EU competition laws and regulatory bodies seek to ban
anticompetitive practices: these regulations have teeth and have resulted in
fines on companies such as Microsoft (product bundling), AstraZeneca
(blocking generic copies of its ulcer drug), and Hoechst, Atofina and Akzo
Nobel (price fixing), imposed by the European Commission, a body set up
to enforce EU competition and consumer law.
UK and EU laws aim to protect the rights of consumers: consumers’ rights
are also protected by EU regulatory bodies and regulations. For example,
consumers’ interests regarding food safety are protected by the European
Food Standards Authority, and the right to compensation for air travellers
whose flights are overbooked, cancelled or delayed is covered by EU rules
(also see previous section).
National laws covering consumer rights and protection and competition
regulation, supported by government-backed regulatory bodies: legislation
at national level is designed to prevent marketing and business malpractice.
Voluntary bodies set up by industries to create and enforce codes of
practice: industries often prefer self-regulation to the imposition of laws by
government. For example, most European countries are self-regulating with
regard to advertising standards, through the drawing up and enforcement of
codes of practice.
While marketers in Europe have freedom to practise their profession,
societal and legal constraints on their actions not only make good sense from a
long-term social and environmental perspective but also make good long-term
commercial sense, too.
The Physical Environmental Forces
The physical environment in a marketing context is concerned with the
relationship between people and the environment. Environmentalists attempt
to protect the physical environment; they are concerned with the
environmental costs of consumption, not just the personal costs to the
consumer. Five environmental issues are of particular concern: climate change,
pollution control, energy conservation, use of environmentally friendly
components, and recycling and non-wasteful packaging. This section
introduces this topic area; Chapter 3 is devoted to exploring sustainable
marketing and society in detail.page 63
Climate change
Concerns about climate change and the problems associated with global
warming originate from a quadrupling of carbon dioxide emissions over the
past 50 years, evidenced by more extreme weather conditions, such as drought,
hurricanes, tropical storms and flooding.
In 1992, countries joined in an international treaty to ‘cooperatively
consider what they could do to limit average global temperature increases and
the resulting climate change and to cope with whatever impacts were, by then,
inevitable’ (UNFCCC 2012). The United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) realized the measures in place to control climate
change were insufficient. Accordingly, it developed the Kyoto
Protocol, an international agreement that focuses member
countries on how to keep global temperature increases below 2 degrees
Celsius. One of the Kyoto actions was to establish market mechanisms
allowing the trading of emissions. Countries committed to the Protocol have
agreed to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and one way to achieve
these targets is to set up projects in developing countries, which can earn
certified emission reduction credits that can be sold (UNFCCC 2022). These
principles also apply to firms; Tesla’s electric vehicles are zero-emission and
so the firm receives credits, which it then sells to other auto manufacturers at a
significant profit; this is an important revenue stream for the car manufacturer.
Tesla has sold ‘green credits’ to Fiat Chrysler, to help this carbon-fuel car
manufacturer avoid fines, and Volkswagen is buying credits from Tesla to help
stay within local environmental rules as it expands its manufacturing into
China. There is significant trade between manufacturers of less polluting cars,
which gain green credits, and those more polluting vehicle manufacturers
(Guardian staff and Reuters 2021; Ramey 2021).
The Paris Agreement, which sets out further ambitious plans to control
climate change, came into force in December 2016 and was adopted by 196
parties at COP21. This agreement requires economic and social changes,
working on a five-year cycle, with countries submitting plans for climate
action (UNFCCC 2022). The Conference of the Parties (COP) brings together
nations and organizations in an attempt to control climate change under the
banner of the United Nations. In November 2021, COP26, which was held in
Glasgow, set out climate goals for the future–greenhouse gases (GHG)
emissions to be net zero by 2050, protect communities and natural habitats,
mobilize finance and work together–and finalized the Paris Agreement, withalmost 200 countries agreeing to keep global temperature rises at 1.5 degrees
Celsius or lower (UN Climate Change Conference 2021).
In 2008, the UK Climate Change Act established the foundations for
cutting greenhouse gas emissions by nurturing low-carbon technologies and
processes. The Act has legally binding targets that must be achieved by 2050
(OECD 2021). The UK has had some success in reducing emissions, and the
government has a new strategy, Build Back Greener, which sets out policies
for decarbonizing the UK economy and is in line with the Climate Change Act
(HM Government 2021).
Pollution control
The manufacture, use and disposal of products can have a harmful effect on
the quality of the physical environment. The production of chemicals that
pollute the atmosphere, the use of nitrates as a fertilizer that pollutes rivers,
and the disposal of by-products into the sea have caused considerable public
concern. For example, plastics, chemical sludge and debris deposited by ocean
currents have accumulated in an area of the northern Pacific Ocean. This ‘trash
vortex’, as it is called by Greenpeace (2012), is equivalent in size to the US
state of Texas and is a major pollution problem for the marine environment. As
the waste degrades, it is ingested by marine animals, poisoning them and
entering the food chain. Sea Shepherd, a not-for-profit marine conservation
charity, estimates that more than 1 million creatures living in the oceans are
killed each year because of plastic. Sea Shepherd’s advert ‘Plastic Ocean’
(Exhibit 2.6) depicts this scenario and is attempting to raise awareness. The list
of manufactured products that have found their way to the vortex is extensive
and includes plastic bottles, polystyrene packaging, traffic cones, disposable
lighters, vehicle tyres and even toothbrushes.
EXHIBIT 2.6

Big brands are aware this can be an emotive issue for consumers and that
they must find ways to ensure compliance with environment
legislation. According to research, an individual produces 4.9
pounds (2.2 kilos) of waste per day (EPA 2018). Waste reduction is a major
issue and manufacturers are finding ways to help consumers reduce their
impact on the planet. Starbucks has announced it is to make a 100 per cent
recyclable coffee cup and put an end to the estimated 6 billion cups that are
discarded each year (Grant 2018). Tencel produces fabrics made from recycled
materials. Joy shampoo cleans your hair and reinvests profit in the community,
creating mobile showers for people living rough, and its packaging is made
from recycled paper. Patagonia’s NetPlus jackets are produced from 100 per
cent recycled fishing nets, sourced from fishermen in South America.
Nespresso is making recyclable coffee pods (Abdelrahman 2022) See Exhibit
2.7, which shows how Brabantia is helping consumers with recycling and
composting of food waste.
EXHIBIT 2.7

Also in response to pollution issues, Denmark has introduced a series of
anti-pollution measures, including a charge on pesticides and a
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) tax. The Netherlands has imposed higher taxes on
pesticides, fertilizers and carbon monoxide emissions. The EU has made an
agreement with car manufacturers to produce colour-coded labels to make it
easier for car users to understand the environmental impact of the vehicle they
choose to drive. Not all initiatives mean adding costs; in Germany, for
example, one of the marketing benefits of its involvement in green technology
has been a thriving export business in pollution-control equipment.
Energy and scarce resource conservation
The finite nature of the world’s resources is driving conservation. Energy
conservation is reflected in the demand for energy-efficient housing and fuel￾efficient cars. In Europe, Sweden has taken the lead in developing an energy
policy based on renewable resources. Its tax system penalizes the use of
polluting energy sources such as coal and oil, while less polluting resources
such as peat and woodchips receive favourable tax treatment. In addition,
Sweden is planning to become the world’s first oil-free economy and to
achieve net-zero emissions by 2045, not by building nuclear power stations but
by utilizing renewable resources such as wind and wave power, geothermal
energy and waste heat. The plan is a response to warnings the world may be
running out of oil, together with global climate change and rising energy
prices. Firms are also making more energy-efficient products.page 65
Another concern of environmentalists is the consumption of wood. Forest
depletion by the deforestation activities of companies and the effects of acid
rain damage the ecosystem. Consumers’ desire for softwood and hardwood
furniture and window frames is at odds with the need to preserve forests.
Trees’ leaves absorb carbon dioxide, and their roots help to stabilize slopes–a
landslide in the Philippines that cost many lives was allegedly caused by
illegal logging. A solution is the replanting of forests to maintain the long-term
stock of trees. The international furniture and home goods retailer, IKEA,
produces millions of pieces of furniture each year and uses 1 per cent of the
world’s wood supply, 99 per cent of which comes from responsibly managed
forests (IKEA 2022). IKEA has many commitments moving the firm towards a
more sustainable future using fewer resources:
Saving energy for customers with cutting-edge LED light bulbs, indoor air
purifiers and energy-saving taps
Becoming climate positive–by decreasing climate footprint, using more
recycled materials, and renewable electricity in stores, distribution units and
factories
Achieving a circular business, whereby over 50 per cent of materials are
from renewable or recycled materials by 2030
Establishing a forest-positive agenda by 2030, by using cotton and wood
only from sustainable sources.
Environmentally friendly ingredients and
components
Environmentalists favour the use of biodegradable and natural ingredients and
components when practicable. Companies have responded to the challenge by
launching products such as the Estée Lauder Origins skincare and cosmetics
range of vegetable-based products containing no animal ingredients. PETA
(People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) campaigns relentlessly against
cruelty to animals. In response, Massimo Dutti, Primark, H&M and Inditex
(owner of Zara) have banned the use of angora wool in their garments, in an
attempt to curb appalling animal-management practices in wool-producing
countries (Kassam 2015). This focus is not only adopted by fast-movingconsumer goods (FMCG) manufacturers: read Marketing in Action 2.5 to find
out how VW is planning to use environmentally friendly components in its
new electronic vehicle, the ID. Buzz.
MARKETING IN ACTION 2.5
ID. Buzz
The ID. Buzz is a new concept for VW: a fully electric commercial vehicle and people
carrier, with zero emissions and an innovative list of features. The retro styling reinforces
the heritage of the brand, but the vehicle is anything but a retrograde step for this leading
vehicle manufacture. Promotional literature about the ID. Buzz lists many innovative
features:
Drive assist
Communicate with traffic infrastructure
Connected vehicle
Park assist
Enhanced driving safety
Energy storage system
Autonomous driving.

VW has committed to meeting energy emission targets and is revising its energy use across
the business. The ID. Buzz has seat covers, flooring and other components made from
recycled materials. One fabric used in the vehicle is SEAQUAL, made from yarn
manufactured using 10 per cent marine plastic and 90 per cent recycled plastic bottles.

Recycling and non-wasteful packaging
Recycling
Many countries, including the UK and EU countries, have strict targets for
recycling, and many government policies and private initiatives are being
introduced to reduce the impact on the planet:
Austria has established policies for managing waste, such as a ban on
landfill and the wide promotion of recycling. The government finances
waste management and supports community activities devoted to removing
waste. Private and public firms collaborate, and recycling of glass, metal,
cardboard and papers works well. Two areas representing challenges in this
country are plastic waste and bio-waste products (Salmenperä 2021).
Germany took the lead in the recycling of packaging by introducing the
VerpackG, a law allowing shoppers to return packaging to retailers for them
to pass back to suppliers. In response, suppliers promised to assume
responsibility for the management of packaging waste. In 1990, it
introduced a mechanism called the Dual System Deutschland (DSD), to
organize the collecting and sorting of waste packaging: consumers are asked
to return glass bottles and waste paper to recycling bins, and encouraged to
separate other recyclable materials, such as plastics, composite packaging
and metals, and place them in yellow bags and bins supplied by the
DSD. Collections take place regularly and (together with the
separating of the refuse) are paid for by the DSD, with the cost ultimately
absorbed by the packaging manufacturers.
Sweden had a tradition for recycling paper and metal before any legislation
was introduced. Resources are recovered and used to make new products.
Sweden sends very little waste to landfill as it reuses 46 per cent of
household waste to turn into energy, and even imports waste from the UK,
Norway and Ireland to generate energy for more than 1 million homes
(Swedish Waste Management Association 2022).
As well as government initiatives, firms are also finding ways to recycle.
Clothing retailer H&M introduced a clothing recycle scheme in which it
gathers its used products and then donates them to charitable organizations for
resale. And further back along the supply chain, manufacturers are developing
new fabrics for the fashion industry made from waste, for example Econyl,
which is made from abandoned fishing nets and old carpets. According toDutchAwareness (2015), these types of fabric can reduce carbon dioxide
impact by 73 per cent.
Wasteful packaging
Single-use packaging is a particular concern for consumers, retailers and
manufacturers (especially of FMCG). Consumers have been alerted to the
impact of waste packaging in our wild open spaces and oceans, and to the
problems caused by landfill sites leaking toxic waste. The packaging industry
is both the problem and the solution. Single-use packaging is widely used for
products such as savoury snacks, dairy desserts, pre-prepared foods,
toothpaste, plastic drink bottles and more, to enable consumers to enjoy
convenient ways to receive and protect their goods. There has been significant
growth in recent years in the use of this type of packaging; the problem is that
much of the resulting waste currently cannot be recycled. The recovery rate for
food plastic waste in the US is around 28 per cent, while in Europe the figure
is 40 per cent (whereas the rate of cardboard recycling is much higher: around
80 per cent in Europe and around 89 per cent in the US). Add this to the fact
that in emerging markets in Asia demand for packaging is outpacing waste
collection. This type of waste is a global problem.
Some countries are tackling the waste issue. Thailand introduced a ban on
single-use plastic bags in retail stores. India is raising awareness and
improving access to recycling collection points. China has banned the
importing of plastic waste and single-use plastic, and is also increasing
recycling points (Feber et al. 2020).
Leading FMCG manufacturers are also taking initiatives to reduce single￾use packaging, and are making commitments to sustainability by introducing
more recyclable packaging, eliminating single-use plastic and incentivizing
customers to recycle. But there is more to be done and all stakeholders across
the supply chain need to take responsibility for waste management, recycling
and reduction of wasteful packaging.
Marketing managers need to be aware of the environmental consequences
of their decisions and activities, and to recognize the possible impact of
environmentally irresponsible actions on the reputation of their firms and
brands. Managers should be alert to the opportunities created by a greater
focus on the environment and should consider communicating their
environmentally conscious credentials to their target markets. See Chapter 3page 67
for further detailed discussion of marketing ethics and corporate social
responsibility.
Culture and Society
Three key social/cultural forces with implications for marketing are: the
changes in the demographic profile of the population, cultural differences
within and between nations, and the influence of consumerism.
Demographic forces
Demographic forces concern changes in populations in terms of their size and
characteristics. Demography is important to marketers because it helps to
predict the size and growth rates of markets, and the need for facilities such as
schools, one-person housing and homes for the elderly. Three major
demographic forces are: world population growth, the changing age
distribution, and the changing structure of households in western countries.
World population growth
Overall, the global population is expanding at about 1.05 per cent a year, an
increase of on average of 81 million people per year (Worldometer 2022).
However, the rate of growth is uneven across the world. In particular, the
population in developed economies is expected to be stable or shrinking,
whereas countries of Africa, India, ‘other Asia’ and Latin America are expected
to account for more than 90 per cent of the projected population
increase during the twenty-first century (see Figure 2.5). As the
populations of these countries grow more youthful, the developed countries
will play host to an ageing population. In 2025, half the population of Europe
will be over 45 years old. For the next decade, the world population is
expected to grow by an average of 97 million per year.
FIGURE 2.5
World population growthThe changing world population distribution suggests that new markets
outside the developed economies may provide attractive opportunities,
although the extent to which this force progresses will depend on a rise in
income levels in the less developed world. Positive trends in Africa suggest
change, although population growth is higher there than in the rest of the
world. According to the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) (2022),
which supports transition to a more equal and sustainable world, fertility rates
have been falling for more than 40 years, with an average of 4.5 children per
woman in 2017, down from 6.6 in 1980, and similar trends are recorded on
other continents. According to AFD (2022) research, this trend is explained by
more families moving to live in cities, where there are more employment
opportunities but smaller accommodation and less reliance on the village
community. So families are becoming smaller, more women are working in
situations where they cannot bring their children to work as they might if
working on farms and in the fields, there are improved education opportunities
for girls, greater awareness of their rights and of contraception; there is also
more sharing of household responsibilities between genders.
Age distributionpage 68
A major demographic change affecting demand for products and services is the
ageing population. In Europe, the share of the population over 65 is growing
and life expectancy is increasing. Population pyramids, showing age
distribution by sex and age group, are predicting growth of older age bands
going forward to 2080. Furthermore, younger age bands are predicted to shrink
relative to older groups, reducing the number of people of working age
(Eurostat 2020).
The growth of older segments has significant implications for marketing:
on the supply side, an ageing workforce and a growing number of migrant
workers who move according to labour demands; on the demand side, EU
citizens over 45 represent substantial marketing opportunities because of their
high level of per capita income and their having higher levels of disposable
income and savings than younger people. With an older population, which has
higher disposable incomes and increased leisure time, demand for holidays and
recreational activities such as entertainment and sporting activities (e.g. golf)
should increase. Older people also have different tastes and needs in terms of
levels of service and style of products. As the palates of older customers
change, they look to buy saltier and spicier foods. Similar ageing trends are
evident in other parts of the globe, and businesses are already seeking to
differentiate their offers for the lucrative ageing market, adapting products and
packaging to meet the needs of older target markets. In Japan, retailer Aeon
designed a new retail concept in Funabashi, with products designed for elderly
shoppers, who can access medical clinics, get discounts on pension day and
enjoy leisure activities ranging from dancing to finding romantic partners
(Lucas 2014).
There are many niche opportunities for firms targeting older segment. For
example, HANX makes condoms with a difference; they are popular with
older users who have interests in the sustainable environment because the latex
and lubricants it uses are approved by the Fair Rubber Association and the
Vegan Society, and designed to protect women’s health. The
condom brand supports the Lady Garden Foundation and the Eve
Appeal, raising awareness of treatment of gynaecological cancers (HANX
2022). Knours is a beauty brand that targets its products according to women’s
experience of menopause and hormonal changes, during pregnancy and
menstruation (Knours 2022). The Wine List (thewinelist.co.uk) caters for
customers with an interest in buying tailor-made wine packages; the average
age of its customers is over 40 (Drumm 2021).Household structure
Changes in household structure and behaviour that have implications for
marketing are the rise in one-person households and households with no
children, and the growth in dual-income families.
More people are living alone by choice and through divorce or
bereavement. This suggests a key market segment is people who demand
products that meet their particular needs, such as one-bedroom houses or
apartments, and single-portion foods. However, households are also changing
their behaviour regarding employment. In many European countries, there has
been a growth in dual-earner families. In the UK, for example, more than half
of couples with dependent children are double-income families. The rise of
double-income households means this market segment possibly has higher
disposable income, which can lead to reduced price sensitivity and the capacity
to buy luxury furniture and clothing products and expensive services (e.g.
foreign holidays, restaurant meals).
The Covid-19 pandemic impacted on households especially in terms of
income. Savings ratios increased significantly; total household debt increased
very slightly in 2021, but unsecured debt fell as households reduced overall
spending (see Figure 2.6). Government interventions like the Coronavirus Job
Retention Scheme, income support and increases in Universal Credit helped to
protect jobs and businesses.
FIGURE 2.6
Household saving ratios in the UK–savings as a percentage of aggregate UK
disposable household income, June 2021page 69
Source: based on ONS (2021)
But low-income households were less able to save and saw personal saving
decrease, while lower-paid workers were more likely to have lost their jobs or
been furloughed, again leading to declines in household income (Francis￾Devine 2021). The pandemic has impacted in many ways locally, globally, and
on individuals’ families and communities. Marketers should ensure they are
aware of these impacts.
Cultural forces
Culture is the combination of traditions, taboos, values and attitudes of the
society in which an individual lives. A number of distinctive subcultures in the
UK provide a rich tapestry of lifestyles and create new markets. Asian culture
has introduced into the UK restaurants and food, fashion and jewellery stores,
supplying unique heritage and style. The free movement of workers around the
EU has also encouraged the growth of subcultures–for example, the flow of
workers from central and eastern Europe to older established EU countries. To
meet the needs of the Polish community in the UK, for example, Tesco sells
extensive ranges of Polish foods.
Brexit has put pressure on collaboration between subcultures in the UK
and member states of the EU. For example, Germany and the UK have much
in common in areas like creative industries, education and
cooperation on research and innovation, but the risks of lack of
free movement and changes to funding and investment have impacted on how
any future activity might take place, potentially reducing research and
innovation, creative projects and collaborative education (MacDonald 2017).
Youth subcultures provide cues for the development of brands, for example
Levi’s jeans, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and MTV.
Attitudes towards food among some sections of society in Europe are also
changing. Pressures around healthy eating have prompted moves towards food
with less fat, sugar and salt, and towards health labelling. For example, the
Nestlé-branded cereal range targeted at children has been reformulated with 10
per cent less sugar. New brands focusing on their healthy credentials have
emerged, like Innocent smoothies, and even McDonald’s has a nutrition
calculator that enables savvy consumers to check what they are eating
(www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb/good-to-know/nutrition-calculator.html).Market segments have appeared based on the concept of ethical consumption,
leading to demand for vegan, fair trade and organic products, together with
avoidance of firms and brands associated with dubious practices. The growth
in healthy eating and ethical consumption has prompted the acquisition of
small ethical brands by larger corporates, for example Rachel’s Organic
yoghurts by Groupe Lactalis, a subsidiary of BSA international, and Ben &
Jerry’s ice cream by Unilever. See Table 2.3 for more examples.

Larger firms often face accusations of unethical behaviour for example,
poor carbon management, polluting, and poor waste management, exploiting
forests and use of palm oil, human rights issues over workers, animal testing.
The smaller brands with strong ethical principles can be sought-after
acquisitions as they can help with the market positioning of the larger
corporate brands and /or to give access to a growing niche markets.
Fair-trade marketing is the development, promotion and selling of fair￾trade brands, and the positioning of organizations based on a fair-trade ethos.
Firms are increasingly realizing many consumers care about how suppliers in
countries of the developing world are treated and wish to support them by
buying fair-trade brands, often at a price premium. For example, Cafédirect, a
fair-trade company and brand, was launched to protect coffee growers from the
volatility in world coffee prices. Minimum prices for coffee beans are paid,
which are pegged above market fluctuations, and business support and
development programmes are provided. The popularity of fair-trade brands has
prompted Nestlé to launch its own fair-trade coffee, Partners’ Blend, and
Marks & Spencer has launched a range of fair-trade clothing which benefits
Indian cotton farmers through a price that includes a premium that can be
invested in their communities (Milmo 2008).
Supermarkets are supporting fair-trade products, with Co-op stocking only
own-label fair-trade tea, coffee and chocolate, and Sainsbury’s selling only
fair-trade bananas. Café chains such as Costa and Pret offer fair-trade varieties.
Fast-moving consumer goods food manufacturers also support the spread of
fair-trade products and have been acquiring ethical brands to facilitate access
to these markets–for example, Unilever’s acquisition of Ben & Jerry’s, which
is a brand that supports local farmers; all of the ingredients in its ice creams
are certified as fair trade. Mondelez, the multinational food and beverage
corporation, expanded its product portfolio with the acquisition of Green &
Black’s, the organic chocolate brand. Fair-trade marketing can be based on the
positioning of firms as having a fair-trade ethos. The success of fair-trade
marketing is based upon consumers being willing to try and repeat-buy fair￾trade brands, and organizations developing genuine fair-trade programmes.
Consumers will not put up with organizations that use such schemes as an
ethical veneer.Successful marketing depends on knowing the cultural differences that
exist between consumers. Cultural differences also have implications for
business-to-business marketing. Within Europe, cultural variations affect the
way in which business should be conducted. Humour in business life is
acceptable in the UK, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands and Spain, but less
commonplace in France and Germany. These facts of business life need to be
recognized when interacting with European business customers. International
culture is revisited in detail in Chapter 20.
The Influence of Consumerism and
Environmentalism
Consumerism is organized action against business practices that are not in the
interests of consumers. The consumer movement is an organized collection of
groups and organizations whose objective is to protect the rights of consumers,
which include the right to expect the product to be safe, for it to perform as
expected, and for communications linked to the product to be truthful and not
misleading. Pressure from consumer groups in Europe has resulted in
prohibitions on tobacco advertising, improvements in car safety, reductions in
the levels of fat, sugar and salt in foods, restrictions on advertising alcohol to
teenagers and the forcing of financial services companies to display true
interest charges (the annual percentage rate, or APR) on advertisements for
credit facilities. Further successes include unit pricing (stating the cost per unit
of a brand) and ingredient labelling (stating the ingredients that go into a
brand).
For decades there has been a debate about whether consumerism is driven
by economic or social drivers, and what the implications are for marketing.
Pinpointing the actual origins of consumerism is difficult, but, simply stated,
the situation has been aggravated by ‘marketing excesses, inflation, economic
recession and questioning of mass-consumption society values has apparently
pushed consumers to ever higher levels of dissatisfaction’ (Straver 1978).
Arguably, marketing stands accused of creating opportunities for firms to sell
more to the consumer, using tactical applications of the marketing mix. The
response has been a growing interest in consumerism. The consumer
movement has had notable successes, including improvements in car safety,
the encouragement of fast-food restaurants to provide healthy-eating options,page 71
health labelling of food products, and the banning of smoking in public places
in some European countries, including Ireland and the UK.
Consumers International (CI) is a worldwide federation of consumer
groups that have joined together as an independent voice of the consumer. On
15 March every year, World Consumer Rights Day (WCRD) endorses the
solidarity of the consumer movement and is an opportunity to promote the
basic rights of the consumer. CI tackles issues from around the world. For
example, in Kenya there were problems with product safety and inappropriate
use of labelling, which could cause serious harm to young consumers; in Asia,
there is a great deal of marketing of unhealthy food to children; in Latin
America, CI is working to protect consumers’ right to a healthy environment.
Globally, unhealthy diets are linked to four of the ten major causes
of early death: obesity, high blood pressure, glucose and
cholesterol. CI is championing consumers’ rights to make healthy food
choices, but one key issue is the mass availability of unhealthy options. In
2022, the focus was on equality issues: fair digital finance highlighting the
pressures and risk consumers face online (Consumer International 2022).
Marketing managers should not consider the consumer movement a threat
to business, but rather an opportunity to create new product offerings to meet
the needs of emerging market segments. For example, in the detergent market,
brands have been launched that are more environmentally friendly, while food
companies have reduced the fat and salt content of some of their products and
continue to introduce healthy option ranges. Pressure from the consumer
movement, environmentalists and individuals who engage in ethical
consumption has resulted in most organizations adopting corporate social
responsibility as a guide to their business practices. Corporate social
responsibility (CSR) refers to the ethical principle that an organization should
be accountable for how its behaviour might affect society and the environment.
The importance of CSR is considered in detail in Chapter 3.
Going forwards, changes in social and cultural aspects of the marketing
environment need to be monitored and understood, so that marketing
management is aware of the changing tastes and behaviour of consumers. Such
changes can create demand shifts that may act as either opportunities or
threats. For further discussion of consumerism, see Marketing in Action 2.6
and Chapter 3.page 72

Consumerism in Sweden and Britain
Source: (l)MBI/Alamy Stock Photo, (r)vesna cvorovic/Shutterstock
British children are trapped in a cycle of compulsive consumption, according to UNICEF. But
children in Sweden are different: they don’t appear to crave products in the same way as
UK children do and have high levels of well-being compared with children in other European
countries.
In the UK and Sweden, the behaviour of parents is cited as a potential cause of children’s
behaviour. In the UK, parents are said to give their children gifts to compensate for their
absence when working long hours, whereas in Sweden, where compulsive consumption is
almost absent, parents spend time with their children, and families enjoy indoor and outdoor
pastimes together. Research suggests there are factors that contribute to well-being: health
and safety, educational well-being, and family and peer relationships. A recent study found
when children in the UK and Sweden said they had had a good day, it was always because
of people not things. A child’s view of a good day is simple: time with those they love
(friends, family and even pets), taking part in creative or sporting activities, and being
outdoors and having fun. However, the study did reveal a desire for products–for example,
phones, tablet computers, laptops and gaming consoles were on the wanted lists of children
from both nations and from a range of different social backgrounds. Functional goods like
footballs, creative art materials and musical instruments, which enable the children to
participate in certain activities, were also high on the list of desired items.
More firms are realizing the importance of children’s rights and are seeking ways to use
marketing and communications to not have an adverse impact. Through the web,
companies are opening the debate to find new ways to interact with children. For example,
the Swedish transport administration agency (Trafikverket) has set up workshops and
invited children to share their views on traffic dangers, signage, noise and other issues.
Based on: Nairn (2011); Swedish Wire (2011); UNICEF (2015); Lagerberg (2018)Environmentalism
While consumerism focuses on improving the balance between consumer and
organizational power, and protecting the rights of consumers in consumption
decisions, environmentalism is broader in scope, with its focus on the physical
environment. Environmentalism is the organized movement of groups and
organizations to protect and improve the physical environment. Their concerns
are: production and consumption of products that lead to global warming;
pollution; the destruction of natural resources such as oil and forests; and non￾biodegradable waste. Environmentalists believe that producers and consumers
should take account not only of short-term profits and satisfaction but also the
cost to the environment of their actions.
Environmentalists support the concept of environmental sustainability and
put pressure on companies to adopt strategies that promote its objectives.
Environmental sustainability means ‘to maintain or prolong environmental
health’. Pressure groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have
been successful in persuading organizations to produce ‘greener’ products such
as cadmium-free batteries, ozone-safe aerosols, recycled-paper toilet tissue and
packaging, catalytic converters, lead-free petrol, unbleached tea bags and
cruelty-free cosmetics. Other environmental groups have successfully changed
company practices. For example, UPM, Finland’s largest paper and pulp
company, which has a presence in more than 16 countries, must replant the
number of trees felled. This is the result of environmentalist action. Major
electrical manufacturers like Philips and Electrolux incorporate environmental
considerations systematically in new product development, and have strict
guidelines covering the integration of environmental considerations into
product design and development.
Environmentalists have concerns about how business activity affects the
environment. This means they constantly pressurize organizations to deal with
issues like controlling carbon emissions, reducing global warming, eliminating
harmful pollutants, and using recycled and recyclable materials in products.
The overarching aim is to maintain a sustainable environment for future
generations.
Ethical consumption
Consumerism and environmentalism are organized movements designed to
protect society and the environment from the harmful effects of production andpage 73
consumption. However, consumers also act in an individual way to protect
society and the environment through engaging in ethical consumption. Ethical
consumption occurs when individual consumers, when making purchase
decisions, consider not only personal interests but also the interests of society
and the environment. Examples include boycotting products and companies
with poor records regarding social and environmental concerns, buying non￾animal-tested products, choosing fair-trade or organic products, avoiding
products made by sweatshop or child labour, and purchasing products that are
made from recycled materials (Crane and Matten 2004).
As discussed earlier, consumers and businesses respond differently to
ethical consumption. Some are passionate about living and operating in a
manner that does not impact on the environment, while others are not, and
many are somewhere in between these two extremes. Marketing managers
must understand their target audiences’ individual values, attitudes and
motivations, and align these with societal values if they are to develop
successful marketing strategies.
The Microenvironment
The microenvironment consists of the actors in the firm’s immediate
environment that affect its capabilities to operate effectively in its chosen
markets. These actors–customers, competitors, distributors and suppliers and
strategic partners–will now be introduced as they are discussed in greater
depth throughout the book.
Customers
In Chapter 1, we learned customers are at the centre of the marketing
philosophy and effort, and it is the task of marketing management to satisfy
their needs and expectations better than the competition. Changing customer
tastes, lifestyles, motivations and expectations need to be monitored so firms
supply appropriately targeted marketing-mix strategies that meet their needs.
Changes in consumer behaviour also need to be monitored. For example,
consumers are using social networking platforms to communicate, share and
buy products–a fact not lost on marketers. The starting point is an
understanding of customers, and it is important to recognize thedifferent types of customers and markets: consumer and business-to-business
markets are considered in detail Chapter 4; Chapter 5 looks at building
relationships; techniques for gathering and analysing customer information are
discussed in Chapter 6; the grouping of consumers to form market segments
that can be targeted with specific marketing-mix offerings is the subject of
Chapter 7.
Competitors
Competitors have a major bearing on the performance of firms. No longer is it
sufficient to meet customer needs and expectations–success is dependent on
doing better than the competition. Market-orientated companies not only
monitor and seek to understand customers, but also research competitors and
their brands to understand their strengths, weaknesses, strategies and response
patterns.
Understanding competitor behaviour is critical to developing marketing
strategies and tactics. For example, when competitors price-cut, the
attractiveness of the market can fall, and competitors’ ability to innovate can
ruin once highly profitable brands. Marketing history is littered with brands
that were once successful but are now defunct because rivals developed and
marketed better alternatives, used better business models, deployed
competitive marketing strategies and tactics. But success is not always
achieved when firms compete with their rivals.
Sony produced Betamax-format video cassettes and attempted to control the
market by not licensing its product to other producers, whereas its rival
Japanese firm, JVC, developed its VHS cassettes using an open format to
avoid Sony’s market domination. VHS became more widely adopted,
leading to greater economies of scale and, critically, offered more recording
time per cassette. Sony eventually dropped Betamax in favour of the VHS
format (Gibbs 2015). Arguably, JVC’s contest with Sony was perhaps the
first format competitive war, but there have been many others, for example
Nintendo vs Sega, PlayStation vs Xbox, Apple vs Android.
Google Lively was an attempt to create a virtual world to rival the then
popular Second Life. Users could create an avatar, add different outfits and
enter a virtual room for a chat (Ralph 2008). Linden Labs, creators of
Second Life, proved to be tough competition, having more than 500,000
users while Google Lively had just 10,000. This virtual world was less thanfive months old when Google shut it down and its failure was attributed to
not conveying the core values of the Google user experience (Anikto 2008).
Amazon’s Fire Phone failed and the parent company lost more than $170
million. The smartphone market is intensely competitive, with two key
success factors strongly contested: design, which Apple leads on; price,
which new market entrants like Xiaomi have dominated. The Amazon phone
did badly on both factors: the design, which had features like a 3D display,
one-handed shortcuts and Firefly (automatic product recognition), was not a
hit with potential customers and the price was similar to the iPhone (at the
time). So, the Fire Phone had little to differentiate it from existing market
leaders, and even less to encourage consumers to switch to the new
smartphone brand (Wohlsen 2015).
Business large and small fail, many in their first few years of trading, due
to underestimating the competition (Sahi et al. 2019). To succeed, firms should
develop a detailed understanding of players in a given market so they are able
to deploy resources and utilize capabilities effectively and efficiently to create
competitive advantage (Blyler and Coff 2003). Part 4 of the book explores
strategic and competitive marketing issues, delving into: how to develop
strategic marketing plans (Chapter 17); how to analyse competitors and create
competitive advantage (Chapter 18); product strategies and market
development (Chapter 19); and international and global marketing (Chapter
20).
Distributors
Firms use the services of distributors such as wholesalers and retailers to
supply end users. As we shall see in Chapter 16, which covers distribution,
channel intermediaries perform many valuable services, including breaking
bulk, making products available to customers where and when they want them,
and providing specialist services such as maintenance and installation. Other
firms, which provide services, dispense with distributors, preferring to deal
direct with end-user customers.
Distributors can reduce the profitability of suppliers by putting pressure on
profit margins. For example, large retailers such as Walmart and Tesco have
enormous buying power and can demand low prices from their suppliers, a fact
that has been criticized in the media when applied to small farmers.page 74
Distribution trends need to be monitored. For example, the trend towards
downloading music has hit traditional music outlets that sell CDs, and the
growth of internet-based sellers such as Amazon has impacted on traditional
bricks-and-mortar booksellers, publishers and authors. As the attractiveness of
distribution channels changes, so suppliers must alter their strategies to keep in
touch with customers.
For many years distribution has focused on channel management
(Wilkinson 2001), but the focus is shifting towards network coordination.
Technology developments in both production and logistics have facilitated
greater and more instant information exchange. Improvements have meant
more responsive and customized distribution systems, and greater integration,
cooperation and interdependence between business partners. Importantly,
instead of developing distribution systems that focus on the ‘exploitation of
power in short-term exchange episodes’, attention is now on … ‘joint actions
in long term business relationships’ (Gadde 2021). From a marketing
perspective, this shift has given rise to new market opportunities for
intermediaries and logistics service providers (Olsson et al. 2013), adding
value through sharing resources and partnering. DHL, a global logistics
provider, operates a European Fulfilment Network (EFN) across Europe,
providing fast delivery for food wholesalers and retailers like Jamoona, which
supplies products direct to end customers. DHL’s EFN provides next-day
deliveries for this seller of exotic fresh foods, giving the firm the opportunity
to compete with very large established competitors (DHL 2022) (see Exhibit
2.8).

Suppliers
Firms are not only dependent on customers, competitors and distributors but
are also influenced by their suppliers. Increases in supply costs can push up
prices, making other alternatives more attractive. For example, increases in the
price of aluminium make plastic more attractive. Powerful suppliers can force
up prices. The rise in the price of gas has been blamed on powerful European
suppliers who, it is alleged, restricted supply to force prices higher.
Firms need to monitor supply availability, such as shortages due to labour
strikes or political factors, as these can cause customer dissatisfaction and lost
sales. Firms also need to be sensitive to alternative input materials that can be
substituted for those of existing suppliers if the latter’s prices rise or
availability diminishes significantly.
Effective supply chain management (SCM) has become a source of
competitive advantage in marketing in recent years. Further developments in
response to the growing demand economy focus on demand chain
management (DCM), which means developing capacity to ensure the supply
chain can respond dynamically to change. Moreover, SCM and DCM systems
are providing greater insights, which firms can use to build new business
models and dynamically create competitive advantage (Bai et al. 2021).
The importance of suppliers is reflected in the discussion of their
relationship with customers in Chapter 4.
Strategic partners
Firms are increasingly partnering with others to co-create added value,
whether that be technical expertise (Google and Salesforce.com–sharing
Google’s marketing platform products enables Salesforce customers to gain
direct access to Google’s services, to enhance customer relationship
management), logistical networks (DHL and Argos/Sainsbury’s–DHL’s two￾man delivery service improves customer service quality for the retailers) or
financial support (Vodafone India and Ideal Cellular–financial investment
enabled creation of a market leader). Strategic partnerships can create
opportunities to expand customer bases, produce a more competitive offer,
share resources and fend off the competition. Fashion brand Reiss
formed a strategic partnership with Next plc, transferring its online
platform and associated operations to the Next Total Platform, thereby
transforming the Reiss online offer and making it more efficient (Shepard2021). L’Occitane has developed strategic partnerships with producers and
farmers around the world to reduce the negative impacts on the environment of
production of its beauty products (e.g. shea butter in Burkina Faso)
(L’Occitane Group 2021). Further discussion of value creation through
relationships is included in Chapter 5.
All elements of the microenvironment need to be monitored and assessed
so opportunities can be exploited and threats combated. This forms an essential
ingredient in maintaining a strategic fit between a company and its marketing
environment.
Monitoring the Marketing Environment
The potential of external forces to affect company performance is high, and
monitoring the marketing environment presents many challenges. A market￾orientated firm needs to be able to respond appropriately. Guo et al. (2018)
studied the internal capabilities of firms and how these affect market
performance in relation to external market forces. Guo and colleagues found
the internal (micro) marketing capabilities of a firm are affected by turbulence
in the external environment, especially in relation to technology forces. The
authors suggest that marketing managers should carefully monitor changes in
the external environment, with the help of customers–who may be more
closely attuned to changes (potential opportunities and threats). By creating a
dialogue, there are opportunities to co-create new products and services.
LEGO, BMW and Made.com are all examples of companies that have adopted
this approach and created new designs by involving their customers in the
process. This research highlights the importance of gaining awareness of the
nature of the environment where firms trade, to be better placed to respond
adaptively to environmental changes, improve planning and decision-making,
and build internal marketing capabilities. Previously, Dieffenbach (1983)
found that formal environmental scanning can deliver multiple benefits, such
as better market awareness, improved resource allocation, greater
diversification and better foreign investment.
Traditionally, the process of monitoring and analysing the marketing
environment of a company is called environmental scanning. This process
provides the essential informational input to create a strategic fit between a
company’s strategies, its organizational operations and the marketingenvironment (see Figure 2.7). Marketing strategy should reflect the
environment even if this means a fundamental reorganization of operations.
FIGURE 2.7
Strategic marketing fit
The most appropriate organizational arrangement for scanning will depend
on the unique circumstances facing a firm. A judgement needs to be made
regarding the costs and benefits of each alternative approach. The size and
profitability of the company and the perceived degree of environmental
turbulence will be factors impinging on this decision. To establish a scanning
system covering every conceivable external force would be unmanageable.
Consequently, there are two key questions for managers when establishing
environmental scanning: what to scan, and how to organize the process. To
answer these questions and develop an effective scanning system, action
should be taken to:
1. Define a feasible range of forces to monitor. These are the potentially
relevant environmental forces that have the most likelihood of affecting
future business prospects (Brownlie 2002). Ansoff (1991) identified that
environmental scanning monitors a company’s environment for signals of
the development of strategic issues that have an influence on company
performance. For example, Google was slow to respond to the social media
phenomenon, which could have been the result of not scanning the right
forces. Not only has this allowed Facebook to develop a very powerful
member base for its social network, but also Google has missed out on anpage 76
opportunity to gather rich, detailed customer data that might enhance its
core revenue stream, online advertising.
2. Design a system that provides a fast response to events. Some
events are only partially predictable, emerge as surprises and grow
very rapidly. It is essential for companies to be informed if they are to
manage in increasingly turbulent marketing environments. Brownlie (2002)
suggests that environmental scanning should enable a company to:
develop forecasts, scenarios and issues analysis as inputs to strategic
decision-making
provide a focal point for the interpretation and analysis of environmental
information identified by other people in the company
disseminate information on the business environment through newsletters,
reports and lectures
evaluate and revise the scanning system itself by applying new tools and
procedures.
The benefits of environmental scanning appear straightforward: a better
understanding of the trading environment gives a company the knowledge to
respond effectively to environmental changes. Web-based environmental
scanning (ES) systems are widely used to help automate the scanning process
and input information directly into marketing management information
systems (Decker et al. 2005). ES is a way for firms to adapt to the marketing
environment and develop strategies that will help them survive. Having an ES
system across a firm’s supply chain enables all partners in the chain to respond
effectively and dynamically to change. Information gathered across the supply
chain enables firms to respond quickly to environmental change (Yu et al.
2019).
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapterpage 77
 Detailed Review
1. The nature of the marketing environment
The marketing environment consists of the microenvironment (customers,
competitors, distributors and suppliers, internal factors) and the macroenvironment
(economic, social, political, legal, physical and technological external forces).
These shape the character of the opportunities and threats facing a company and
yet these external forces are largely uncontrollable.
2. The distinction between the microenvironment and the macroenvironment
The microenvironment consists of those actors in the firm’s immediate
environment that affect its capabilities to operate effectively in its chosen markets.The macroenvironment consists of several broader forces that affect not only the
company but also the other actors in the microenvironment.
3. The impact of the following forces on marketing decisions: technological,
economic, political and legal, the physical environment, social/cultural
Technological forces can have an impact on marketing decisions by changing the
rules of the competitive game. Technological change can provide major
opportunities and pose enormous threats to companies. Marketers need to
monitor technological trends and pioneer technological breakthroughs.
Economic forces can have an impact on marketing decisions through their effect
on supply and demand. Key factors are economic growth, unemployment, interest
and exchange rates, and changes in the global economic environment such as the
growth of the EU and the Eurozone and the rise of the economies of China, South
Korea, Brazil, India and Mexico. Marketers need to have contingency plans in
place to cope with economic turbulence and downturns, and to be aware of the
opportunities and threats arising from changes in the global marketing
environment.
Political and legal forces influence marketing decisions by determining the rules for
conducting business. In Europe, marketing decisions are affected by legislation at
EU and national levels. EU laws seek to prevent collusion, prevent abuse of
market dominance, control mergers and acquisitions, and restrict state aid to firms.
National laws also affect marketing decisions by regulating anticompetitive
practices. The UK has left the EU and has national laws. There are additional
regulations and controls firms must consider when operating outside the EU.
The physical environmental forces are concerned with the environmental costs of
consumption. Five issues that affect marketing decisions are: combating global
warming, pollution control, conservation of energy and other scarce resources, use
of environmentally friendly ingredients and components, and use of recyclable and
non-wasteful packaging. Marketers need to be aware of the environmental
consequences of their actions, and aware of the opportunities and threats
associated with ecological issues.
Social/cultural forces can have an impact on marketing decisions by changing
demand patterns (e.g. the growth of the over-50s market) and creating new
opportunities and threats. Three major influences are changes in the demographic
profile of the population, cultural differences within and between nations, and the
impact of consumerism.
4. How to conduct environmental scanning
Two key decisions are what to scan and how to organize the activity.
Four approaches to the organization of environmental scanning are to use line
management, the strategic planner, a separate organizational unit and joint
line/general management teams.
The system should monitor trends, develop forecasts, interpret and analyse
internally produced information, establish a database, provide environmental
experts, disseminate information, and evaluate and revise the system.
5. How companies respond to environmental change
Response comes in five forms: ignorance, delay, retrenchment, gradual strategic
repositioning and radical strategic repositioning.page 78

CASE 3
THE NEW [AUGMENTED]
REALITY FOR FASHION
RETAILING
Introduction
This case study focuses on the challenges experienced by fashion retailers during and after the
Covid-19 pandemic, with consideration of macroenvironmental and microenvironmental issues
impacting current and future decisions in fashion offline and online retailing. It argues for
continued development and investment in technologies such as augmented and virtual reality
(AR and VR) as well as 3D, to enhance the customer experience while supporting the
traditional high-street store and the virtual environment, as well as benefiting fashion retailing
distributors and supporting a sustainable environment into the future.
The Challenges for the Retail Sectorpage 84
The global fashion retail sector has been undergoing rapid, substantive and transformative
change in recent years, accelerated by advances in technology, ever-evolving consumer tastes
and growing expectations especially around ethical and sustainable consumption. However, the
impact of Covid-19 forever altered consumer behaviour, eradicated the need for the ‘bricks and
mortar presence’, boosted fashion e-commerce, empowered consumers to become more
autonomous and, in turn, diminished the need for store assistants on the same scale as before
(Grgic and Stipetic 2020). Furthermore, with the uncertain climate, the need for luxury fashion
diminished. While demand for fast fashion may not yet be on the decline, slow fashion is
becoming more popular with consumers, who are becoming more ethically and sustainably
conscious in their consumption habits (Rauturier 2022).
Fashion Retailing Today
To effectively survive and compete brands must invest in a quality online, seamless
omnichannel experience. Brands also must develop and maintain a visible stance on
sustainable issues. Multiple channels and touchpoints are essential for a seamless customer
experience: expanding customer engagement channels, adding more self-service options,
merging data and personalizing communications and customer loyalty programmes (Lynch
2021). In addition, ever-increasing customer expectations in both offline and online settings
must continuously be addressed and augmented, and include ease of access to products and
customer service, a sense of immediacy, high levels of interaction and engagement, yet often in
a contactless and frictionless environment with an optimal retail and brand experience (Amed et
al. 2019).
Furthermore, in the macroenvironment, there are many issues to contend with from an
economic, political, technological, ecological, demographic and socio-cultural perspective.
Inflation has hit an all-time high, and retailers are dealing with very high fuel costs; challenges
related to the conflict in Ukraine, ongoing political barriers around Brexit, Covid-19 and a myriad
of future uncertainties are impacting the supply chain. Ongoing economic uncertainty is
impacting all supply chain stakeholders, from manufacturer, retailer and distributor to final
consumer. Furthermore, additional manufacturing issues such as minimum wage increases and
legislation concerning human resource issues, most especially regarding workplace conditions,
need to be addressed proactively. Individually and collectively, these growing operating costs
have had an impact on the bottom line and future strategy of every retail organization.
Advances in technology are impacting the fashion retail sector for all involved from a
manufacturing, supply chain, customer service, and commercial and marketing perspective.
The e-commerce environment continues to thrive and, according to the UK’s Office for National
Statistics (ONS 2021), non-food stores provided the largest contribution to growth in retail and
online sales in the textile, clothing and footwear sector have grown by 36 per cent year-on-year,
with online sales as a proportion of retail comprising 57.6 per cent. Ecological concerns abound
for all stakeholders in areas such as sourcing of raw materials, fast fashion and
sustainability. Finally, demographic and socio-cultural issues affect multiple
elements in fashion retail management, in line with ever-evolving trends, changes in cultures,
subcultures, lifestyles and population/demographic changes (Chron Contributor 2020).
‘Omni-present’ Retailing
Leading (online and offline) fashion retailers such as ASOS, Boohoo and Zara are prioritizing
investment in technology, particularly in areas such as e-CRM and augmented reality (AR) to
remain competitive, and in an effort to offer innovative, personalized and seamless customerexperiences (BearingPoint 2021). Application programming interfaces (APIs) enable
businesses to streamline and connect all of their applications and strategy under one seamless
interface, which integrates technologies and systems. APIs enable companies to build a single
customer view, create an omnichannel experience, improve operational efficiency, and deliver
personalized and responsive retail experiences across multiple platforms for the benefit of the
consumer (Salesforce Inc., MuleSoft 2022). Technology increasingly has a key role to play in
retail competitiveness, with two-way QR codes, RFID technology, near-field communication
(NFC), augmented reality (AR), NFTs (non-fungible tokens), smart checkout and store
management systems becoming the norm in every retail unit (Dopson 2022).
Mobile e-commerce, otherwise referred to as m-commerce (mobile commerce) is proving useful
for both online and offline stores in connecting to customers and offering them a personalized
service. Mobile e-commerce has increased and is set for further growth, with 73 per cent of e￾commerce conducted through mobiles as things currently stand (Oberlo 2022). Since 2020,
there has been a significant increase in mobile shopping, especially among millennial and Gen
Z consumers and via apps such as Amazon, eBay, Pretty Little Thing and Shein (Joshi 2021). It
is widely predicted that mobile will become the preferred channel for online shopping in the
coming years (Insider Intelligence 2022). Furthermore, social media sites such as Facebook,
Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest and Snapchat have introduced ‘buy buttons’. The use of apps has
become the norm for many fashion-conscious consumers, with younger consumers purchasing
most of their fashion choices via an app. These apps assist customers in researching brands,
products and reviews, visualizing and even ‘virtually’ experiencing a potential product,
purchasing and re-purchasing it–as well as benefiting by being part of a customer loyalty and
reward programme. Smartphone technology, app development, artificial intelligence, data
mining, and augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR) have accelerated the growth and
adoption of the virtual fashion store. Most fashion retailers have developed mobile-friendly e￾commerce opportunities aligned with digital integration of marketing and influencer functionality,
as well as integrating additional payment providers such as PayPal, Stripe, Square, Shopify,
Skrill and Google Pay.
Advancing Global E-commerce Through
Augmented and Virtual Reality and 3D Models
Many global fashion retail companies–from luxury brands to high street–such as Nike, Reebok,
Burberry, Gucci, Timberland and Lacoste, as well as ASOS and H&M (Johnson 2021), are
using a variety of e- and m-commerce platforms that leverage AR, VR and 3D models to
enhance the shopping experience (Chalimov 2021). A significant percentage of e- and m￾commerce revenue is generated because of global fashion retail business expansion, mass
adoption of smartphone technology, emerging worldwide middle classes with disposable
income, and the growth in influencers (Orendorff and Dopson 2022). Fashion brands such as
Burberry have successfully boosted customer engagement with AR, and Burberry’s
collaboration with Google offered the in-store shopping experience direct to shoppers’ digital
devices, displaying 3D images of products. Similarly, Gucci enables customers to remotely and
virtually try on its Ace sneakers collection, and went one step further, partnering with Snapchat
to offer instant messaging. ASOS launched an experimental AR extension called Virtual
Catwalk within its app, allowing customers to see how clothes fit on 16 different models from
sizes 4 to 18 (Kang 2021).
Consequently, shoppers can more easily visualize the prospective purchase, aiding their
decision-making and increasing the likelihood of purchase. The adoption of this technology has
led to a global and wider customer base with a greater spend. Additional benefits for the retailerpage 85
include increasing customer engagement, increasing development and curation of social media
content, identifying customer preferences, delivering a contactless experience and supporting
customer loyalty programmes. Deloitte has suggested that 40 per cent of shoppers would be
prepared to pay even more for a product if they were able to test it through AR technology
(Ebbesen and Machholdt 2019). In environmental terms, it is also proving to be an eco-friendly
initiative, reducing journeys to stores and leading to fewer returned orders.
More than 3.5 billion people (or 44 per cent of the world population) are using smartphone￾based AR, with 32 per cent of AR users utilizing it for shopping (Softwaretestinghelp.com 2022).
Leading AR and VR apps such as IKEA Place, ScopeAR, Augment, Modiface, Pokémon GO,
Medical Realities, Roar, uMake, Lens Studio and Giphy World have certain criteria in common:
consideration of hardware specifically for mobile/tablet cameras, security and privacy
guidelines, as well as AR software development kits (SDKs) that include functionalities such as
3D recognition and tracking, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), location
recognition (GPS support) (Softwaretestinghelp.com 2022), image recognition, motion tracking,
light estimation and environment tracking, that best suit AR clothing and make-up apps, as well
as consideration of the overall user interface and experience (UI and UX) (Bhatt 2020).
Some of the best fashion AR apps (according to www.supersuperagency.com/blog/top-fashion￾ar-app-concepts) include:
1. Zara AR app
2. Burberry AR collaboration with Google
3. Nike Fit app
4. Shopify AR
5. Wanna Kicks sneakers try-on camera
6. Zara Shop the Look
7. Converse Shoe Sampler
8. Inkhunter AR app
9. Wanna Nails
0. Uniqlo AR app
1. Timberland AR mirrors
2. Lacoste LCST
3. Sephora AR makeover app
4. L’Oréal virtual make-up app
5. Charlotte Tilbury Magic Mirror
6. Ray Ban virtual try-on

Clearly, AR contributes to e-commerce, and has been and continues to be mutually beneficial
for organizations and consumers alike. VR exploits all technological advances and ameliorates
business offerings, including new product launches, is fully immersive, and enhances and
personalizes the customer experience (BigCommerce 2022). Gamification in fashion using AR
is also an effective means of brand engagement, through mini games (e.g. ASOS fashion
shows and Victoria’s Secret with its PINK line, helping customers understand what a brand
offers (Boiko 2021). Furthermore, 3D technology can be used to create prototypes and
products quickly, and can offer three-dimensional modelling of products (albeit in a virtual
manner) as an immersive and interactive experience, both in a physical and/or virtual setting
(Wynne Lockhart 2021).
Fashion Disruptors
There is a growing consensus that fast fashion has been impacted by consumers who are more
ethically and sustainably aware, as well as those seeking a superior-quality customer
experience with the brand as well as with the platform. Consumers are seeking out user￾generated content (UGC) such as reviews from fellow customers, and desire a more authentic
level of engagement. However, even the most fashion-conscious consumer cannot keep up
with avant-garde technology that includes NFTs, AI-powered sizing and fashion-led gaming that
includes platforms such as Dress-X, digital-only NFT-focused marketplaces such as RTFKT
(pronounced ‘artefact’, acquired by Nike in December 2021), and innovations
companies like Alvanon and BodyBlock AI that offer technology to elevate design,
fitting and sizing strategies (Naklakha 2021).

Experiential Shopping
The challenge for fashion retailers who have a high-street as well as an online presence has
been the switch by consumers to online shopping and a hesitancy to try on clothes in-store
before buying. Since the start of the pandemic, retailers such as Adidas, ASOS, Zara and Gap
have rolled out their own AR fitting rooms and experiences. Examples of AR in retailing include
virtual tours, space visualization and large products shopping (used successfully by IKEA in
selecting furniture for a room), colour matching (used by paint companies like Dulux), in-storedisplays, as well as brand engagement and customer loyalty initiatives (Marr 2021). AR and VR
are used in outfit visualization, AR fitting rooms and AR-enabled try-ons (by jewellery, clothing
and eyewear companies), virtual tailors, colour-changing apps, AR virtual showrooms, social
media AR filters, virtual makeovers used by brands such as Mac and L’Oréal, AR mirrors used
by stores such as UNIQLO, in-store navigation and digital advertising. AR has become a real
bonus as shoppers do not have to worry about ordering clothes of the wrong size, or make-up
in an incorrect shade, with 56 per cent of shoppers considering it has made their shopping
experience easier (Harrison 2022). The use of innovative technologies such as AR and even
online video chats, recreates an in-store shopping experience, enhances customers’
experiences, offers a more personalized experience for online shoppers, and reduces the need
for additional customer support and the high return rate of online purchases.
The Future of Customer Loyalty
CRM loyalty programmes are usually associated with a points-based tiered reward system,
typically with customers redeeming points for discounts, and while financial rewards matter,
today’s customers prioritize charity, ethical practices, and community- and sustainability-driven
initiatives (Bzik 2020). In recent times, loyal customers have been seeking out value-based
loyalty reward systems that are based on additional, deeper social interactions, offering more
personalized curated shopping experiences (Diehl 2022). Sustaining relevancy for the brand,
maintaining momentum with customer preferences that rapidly evolve and taking into
consumers’ differing preferences based on socio-cultural differences are key (Chitrakorn 2021).
From a medium- and long-term perspective, customer loyalty will reach another level, thanks to
greater collaboration between fashion retail brands, influencers and platforms, AR and VR
tools, AI product recommendations, enhanced CRM programmes, and a more sophisticated
and personalized shopping experience as a result of more intricately considered customer
journey mapping, right through from search stage to after-sales service experiences, enhanced
UX design and CX (Grgic and Stipetic 2020).
The features/benefits offered through increased digitization of the customer journey and by
retailers’ loyalty programmes include mapping and enhancing each stage of the entire customer
journey and experience. Increasingly loyalty programmes are not just about ‘hard rewards’ such
as discounts and redeeming points, but also the addition of ‘soft rewards’ such as augmenting
the experience for customers through deeper engagement and development of bonds through
value-based loyalty programmes, improved content development, and additional engagement
with social and sustainable issues that are a priority for the consumer (Chitrakorn 2021).
The Future of Fashion Retailing
Technological developments in areas such as clothing design and manufacturing, as well as
stock control systems, may well have contributed to fast fashion, but AI has in turn contributed
to improved design, fitting and craftsmanship. Furthermore, on the shop floor there have been
developments in AI shelving and JIT systems, as well as inventory and cleaning robots. Service
robots may be able to guide customers through a store, or summon a ‘real’ employee, while
some mirrors have become ‘smart’ assistants. From a digital marketing communications
perspective, new forms of technology will facilitate enhanced customer experiences, particularly
in the areas of ‘re-ecommerce’, personalization and smart, sustainable fashion (KPMG 2021).
By 2030, retail and manufacturing experts predict that the fashion retail sector will evolve into a
completely new market situation, with a variety of social and economic factors playing a
significant role in its transformation. Increased digitization, e-commerce opportunities,page 87
sustainability, customer-centricity and reduction in physical presence, coupled with an increase
in VR, will drive fashion retailers to reposition themselves, their brands, product and service
offerings, their ethos and future strategy (KPMG Ireland 2021).
Questions
1. Discuss the challenges for both consumers and fashion retailers during and after the Covid￾19 pandemic, in light of the microenvironmental and macroenvironmental factors.
2. Identify what challenges can be addressed that will benefit the ecological/physical
environment and a retailer’s corporate reputation, and contribute to ethical consumerism.
3. Discuss how high-street fashion retailers scan the environment, and the various responses

CASE 4
SODASTREAM: USING
ENVIRONMENTAL
AWARENESS TO REACH
GENERATIONS X, Y AND Z
The increasing popularity of sparkling water over the past decade can be attributed to a rise in
health consciousness among consumers, as well as the brand appeal of such major players as
LaCroix Sparkling Water and Perrier. The global soft drink market (i.e. non-alcoholic beverages)
is extremely lucrative, with revenue expected to be US$900 billion in 2022 and an estimated
annual growth of 5.36 per cent.
SodaStream International, a major presence in the sparkling water market, is a company that
distributes seltzer-making units and syrups in 47 countries via 70,000 different retail locations,
and has a long tradition and rich history. The company’s origins go back to 1903, when it was
one of the first providers of a system that allowed people to make carbonated water (otherwise
known as ‘sparkling water’) at home. Founded by W&A Gilbey, the famous London gin distiller,
its first soda-making apparatus was very popular with the British upper class. Even the royal
family was equipped with a seltzer-making unit in the early twentieth century.page 90
The company, constantly improving and updating its technology, now sells systems that allow
people to add flavouring and produce their own soda from regular tap water, whenever they
want to. Since 2020, people with SodaStream units have been able to make Pepsi beverages
such as Pepsi, Pepsi Max and 7UP in the comfort of their very own homes. SodaStream claims
that its machines are cost effective, allowing people to make sparkling water for only $0.20 per
litre and traditional flavoured sodas for about $0.57 per litre. SodaStream had a 23.6 per cent
share of the US retail carbonated water market in 2021, but it is in the Scandinavian countries
that the company has seen its greatest success, maintaining a market share of about 50 per
cent for years.
SodaStream initially operated as a business-to-business enterprise, selling to third-party
retailers, which would then market the products in their own stores. The company has long
factored environmental concerns into its business model, using a closed-loop system whereby
consumers return used cylinders to retailers for cleaning and reuse. The company has also
been investing heavily in digital transformation technology to align its operational and business
goals with sustainable solutions and products.
As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, SodaStream saw the opportunity to reach a wider
audience as the cook-at-home trend increased consumer investment in home appliances. This
dovetailed nicely with an increasing prevalence for consumers to invest more in sustainable
products. A reported 45 per cent of shoppers have said that they are more likely to make
sustainable purchases since the pandemic hit, according to the consultant Accenture, with Gen
Z and millennial consumers even more likely to make purchase decisions based on these
values. As a result, SodaStream has the lofty ambition to become an essential piece of kitchen
equipment. As Jörn Viefhues, managing director of SodaStream Nordics AB, puts it, ‘80% of
Scandinavian households have the “big three” of a coffee machine, toaster and kettle in their
kitchen. Our goal is to put SodaStream on the same level of ubiquity.’
As a result, SodaStream has made it clear that it plans to revamp the way it markets its
products, focusing on the message of sustainability. Its current slogan, ‘Good for You, Better for
the Planet’, was introduced in the viral video entitled ‘The Small Things’ starring Snoop Dogg,
which first aired on social media in November 2020. The critical marketing message of
SodaStream has become, ‘Get yourself a sparkling water maker, and save thousands of single￾use plastic bottles a year!’ According to Karin Schifter-Maor, the chief marketing officer of the
brand, the reason Snoop Dogg was chosen was because ‘Nothing is small with Snoop. He is
larger than life. He was a good person to collaborate with for this message in the SodaStream
way, which is humor and smiles. With Snoop, we wanted to create a platform where
sustainability becomes cool and fun.’ The goal, as announced by Ms Schifter-Maor, is to reach
out to new demographics including the ‘sinks and dinks’ (single income/double income–no kids)
category, as well as millennials. Up until 2020, SodaStream was primarily targeting the Gen Y
cohort.
By partnering with Snoop Dogg, the company realized it could profit from his popularity and
reach adoring Gen Z fans as well, while at the same time maintaining a relationship with Gen X
and Y clients, who also appreciated Snoop Dogg’s humour. It can also be argued that the
Snoop Dogg partnership reinforces the brand’s mission by using the Gen Z group as ‘paradigm
change agents’. What this means is that even though Gen Z might not be SodaStream’s core
consumers, their parents and grandparents are. The brand thus counts on Gen Z to act as a
sort of encourager, communicating the message of sustainability, health and wellness to others,
hopefully resulting in increased sales for SodaStream.In addition to run-of-the-mill marketing and strategic challenges, the company has also faced
political issues related to the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 2015, the company closed
a factory that was situated in the Mishor Adumim industrial zone of the Ma’aleh Adumim
settlement in the West Bank and moved its operations to Idan HaNegev in southern Israel. The
international Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, which is critical of Israel, has
not yet removed SodaStream from the list of ‘Enterprises to be put in quarantine’ and the
campaign to boycott SodaStream products is ongoing. Despite the ever-present political
challenges facing SodaStream, luckily it has some elements clearly in its favour: consumer
psychology and post-pandemic behaviour. Personal well-being, conscious consumption,
naturalness and sustainability have become major factors for current product development in
the beverage market. The pandemic has brought increased interest in SodaStream products,
with the company’s home systems now selling from roughly US$90 to US$160. For many
people who buy one of these home units, the action registers mentally as a type of investment
rather than a simple purchase. Customers have incurred a sunk cost, and as a result, have a
‘psychological incentive’ to use the machine as many times as possible in order to recoup the
purchase cost through the savings they receive by making soda more cheaply at home.
Furthermore, the claim that one can avoid wasting 730 plastic bottles a year simply by using
SodaStream sparkling water makers targets the environmental consciousness of Gen Z, which
can then influence Gen Y and X. Hopefully, for SodaStream, people trying to save money and
avoiding plastic waste is a trend that will never go out of style.

he world has changed, people have changed and the way businesses
operate has changed fundamentally in the past decade. Why? On an
environmental level, the impact of global warming and the outlook for the
climate have brought into focus the importance of achieving a low-carbon
future, learning how to reduce energy consumption, working with renewable
energy, reusing materials and cutting waste. On a societal level, inequality,
race, gender, poverty, online media and the Covid-19 global pandemic are all
affecting how we behave as individuals and communities. This chapterexplores how the environment and society are changing the marketing
landscape. Hidden gems are organizations, brands or people seeking to make a
difference to marketing and business practices. In Hidden Gem 3.1 we look at
Pangaia, an organization that focuses on what we buy online and engineers
products that can be changed to become more environmentally acceptable.
Begin by reading Hidden Gem 3.1, and consider how businesses can change
how they behave in order to operate sustainably and ethically.
HIDDEN GEM 3.1
Pangaia
Pangaia is ‘a material science company on a mission to save our environment’ (Pangaia
2022). It brings together expert teams of scientists, technologists and designers to develop
products that are technology led using bio-engineered materials. The name ‘Pangaia’
comes from Pan, meaning all-inclusive, and Gaia, mother earth. The underlying philosophy
of the business is to generate profits that can be invested in organizations and causes that
are impacting the planet. Examples of the causes on which it is focusing are Black Lives
Matter (raising awareness of issues and promoting education), Protecting Wildlife (wildfires
in Australia), Costa Brazil (collaboration to support indigenous communities in the Amazon
rainforest) and Covid-19 Relief (supporting Doctors Without Borders).Source: Anita Ponne/Shutterstock
Pangaia is bringing together expert teams and their knowledge to do things differently. It has
more than 200 fabrics and its R&D teams are constantly developing more–for example,
organic and recycled cotton, seaweed fibre, botanical dyes and C-Fiber™ (a 100 per cent
biodegradable fabric produced using a process that saves water). Made of pulp from the
eucalyptus tree and seaweed powder, C-Fiber™ is made using a closed-loop production
system that recycles water (from the ocean and rainfall rather than fresh water) and reuses
99 per cent of the solvents used in the manufacturing process. C-Fiber™ is used to
manufacture T-shirts and leisurewear. In addition to producing a range of products sold
direct to the consumer, Pangaia also works with other manufacturers to build partnerships
to help the fashion industry to become more sustainable.
The underlying philosophy of Pangaia is built on a set of sustainable development goals,
which are integrated throughout the business: innovation and infrastructure, reducing
inequalities, engendering responsible consumption and productions, climate action,
protecting the oceans and life on land.

about organizational change: socio-sustainability, corporate social
responsibility (CSR), the value cycle, and how brands can change their
strategies to adopt sustainable approaches to marketing.
The chapter concludes with two case studies in which you can discover
McDonald’s and it’s plan for environmental change and Unilever’s approach to
sustainability.
The Environment, Society and the
Changing Marketing Landscape
The Pangaia Hidden Gem case highlights how it is possible to do things
differently, but this is just one organization among many millions around the
globe. Before we delve further into the dimensions of sustainability and
marketing, relevant marketing theory and how firms are responding, let’s
identify some of the key sustainability issues shaping the marketing landscape
and build on issues raised in Chapter 2.
Globalization brings many positives: access to new markets, increased flow
of goods and services, reduction of trade barriers, growth in development
and employment in deprived areas through international investment, sharing
of cultures, openness, sharing of innovations and technology. Less positive
factors, however, are increased product miles, using more fossil fuels to
move goods across global supply chains, invasive species transported to
new habitats in shipping containers and freight vessels, economic
specialization that intensifies the need for global trade, poor working
conditions, worker inequalities, over-exploitation of natural resources, and
more (Stobierski 2021).
The industrialization of agriculture and farming supports the food needs for
rapidly growing world populations. Through the use of pesticides and high￾yield crops, food production increases but there is a heavy price to be paid
in terms of the environment. On a global scale industrial farming has
intensified land use and, in so doing, has put pressure on local ecosystems,which in turn can reduce reliance on renewable energy, and cause
deforestation, water and air pollution, over-exploitation of natural resources
and over-fishing. The resulting loss of habitats has led to decreased
biodiversity and the extinction of many species, and a significant impact on
the climate and natural resources (Dorninger et al. 2021; UN Environment
Programme 2022).
Politics and climate change: scientific communities generally agree the
climate is changing. Political advocates for action, from Swedish
environmentalist Greta Thunberg to US politician Al Gore, have helped to
ensure world governments are aware of the need to tackle the issues. Yet
political discourse all too often diverts attention away from finding rapid
solutions for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, mitigating greenhouse gas
(GHG) production and setting sustainably responsible deadlines to halt
adverse global changes (Glavovi et al. 2021). In 2021, the COP26 climate
summit brought together influential parties from across the globe in a bid to
speed up the goals on climate change set by the Paris Agreement and the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UN 2021). Commentators
argue outcomes from the summit showed progress but not enough to halt the
climate crisis facing the planet (Mountford et al. 2021). For example, the
call to scrap coal as a usable fossil fuel prompted much political debate,
eventually leading to an agreement to ‘phase down’ coal use rather than
phase it out (Harvey et al. 2021).
The depletion of natural resources is a major environmental challenge for
businesses and policy-makers. It can have a negative impact on food
production, and increase health hazards and the risk of natural disasters. Air,
water, forests, animals and plants are examples of natural resources affected
by increased pollution and GHG emissions (Lampert 2019). Solutions need
to be found through reductions in consumption, increases in recycling and
renewable energy, and other strategies and policies that halt the use of
natural resources.
Waste reduction: the Worldwide Fund for Nature (2022) has estimated that
one-third of global food production goes to waste. While, as it rots, organic
waste generates carbon dioxide and methane (which can be used in energy
production), natural resources are used in the incineration of inorganic
waste, and plastic waste generates GHG emissions throughout its lifecycle.
Waste management processes contribute to GHG emissions. A related issue
is malnutrition (which includes under-nutrition and obesity), which ispage 96
causing health challenges that are increasing along with the effects of
climate change (Swinburn et al. 2019).
A fair society, equality and inclusion: an individual’s life chances–in terms
of, for example, life expectancy, disability, mortality and obesity–are likely
to be influenced by their socio-economic position in society (Marmot et al.
2010). The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the social determinants of health
inequalities and equity, with poorer populations, disadvantaged ethnic
groups, low-paid essential workers, migrants, older people (living alone and
in residential care homes) and homeless people just some of those adversely
affected by the pandemic. Causes of these inequalities range from
poverty, deprivation and overcrowded housing to poor work safety
and inaccessible public health provision (World Health Organization 2021a).
Furthermore, European citizens are also frustrated about issues of inequality
(social and economic), inequality of education, loss of cultural identity
related to globalization, unfair treatment, access to technology and job
polarization, with high demand for skilled tech-related jobs, and manual
jobs being eliminated by robots and artificial intelligence (AI) (European
Commission Joint Research Centre 2017).
The above list touches on the key issues shaping the marketing
environment that marketing managers, planners and strategists must consider
when developing marketing strategies. Now read Marketing in Action 3.1.
MARKETING IN ACTION 3.1
We Know What the Problems Are, But What Are We
Doing to Halt the Deteriorating Climate?
The first Earth Day, on 22 April 1970, was a landmark in the environmental change
movement. It raised concern about changes in global temperatures, air and water pollution,
and demonstrations were held that made pleas to clean up the world. These early alarm
bells have not, however, halted rising global temperatures, largely due to the increased
concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, resulting from the consumption of fossil
fuels. World governments have sought to maintain the climate and limit global warming to
under 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Nonetheless, the upward trend continues and
devastating climate events–excessively high temperatures, rain, floods and hurricane-force
winds–continue to impact on global populations. Polluted waterways and oceans, with
multiple causes, along with the dumping of industrial and agricultural waste, have caused a
decline in fish populations and an increase in disease-causing chemicals being trapped in
fish. Waste levels are on the rise, with world populations producing more rubbish than wasthe case 50 years ago. On a positive note, air pollution is one area where progress has
been made, as major airborne pollutants–nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and lead–are
under control (Thompson 2020).

Moving forward, Earth Day 2022 has set itself some big challenges: to bring together
business and politics to act on the climate, and to emphasize that a ‘green future is a
prosperous future’. EARTHDAY.ORG is an environmental movement and not-for-profit
organization that, through education and action, is working with collaborators and partners
in more than 192 countries. The organization’s mission is to hold all sectors across the
planet to account and to secure their involvement in tackling the environmental crisis.

Sustainability Marketing
Over the decades, marketing and branding have enabled firms to grow into
global corporations, turning over billions, if not trillions, of dollars a year.
Strong brands develop relationships with their customers, which enable the
creation of mutual benefits and increased value, with the goal of selling more
products and services. So far, so good? Not without consideration of the wider
societal and sustainability impact. Although many companies are adopting
environmental and social policies that fit with their organizational structures
and stakeholder expectations, individuals are rethinking their own values and
attitudes, meaning that businesses should adapt and position their brands to
align with these new socially responsible customer values and expectations. To
do so, firms should not only plan from a resourcing perspective but should also
pay attention to the physical environment and sustainability in order to survive
into the future over, say, 10, 50 or 100 years. Nestlé is one global corporationpage 97
that touches people’s lives from end to end of the supply chain: from producer
to consumer. It has made 36 public commitments, which seek to
ensure all of its operations contribute to ‘enhancing the quality of
lives and contributing to a healthier future for the planet’. The corporation is
committed to creating shared value across the organization. Key areas of
concern are:
individuals and families, where the focus is on encouraging better diets and
healthier choices, and reducing malnutrition
communities, where the aim is to understand the challenges facing
producers and farmers
employees, respecting and promoting human rights throughout the business
and across the value chain, and ensuring equality and diversity in
employment
the planet, caring for the environment, paying particular attention to climate
change and water.
Indeed, water and its future supply is a key concern, and the corporation
has been investing in raising water stewardship standards across its operations,
which means reducing consumption of water during manufacturing processes,
improving efficiency, facilitating the use of recycled water, increasing access
to safe drinking water and sanitation, and raising awareness of water
conservation (Nestlé Corporation 2022).
But how do businesses, large and small, local and global–from a marketing
viewpoint–determine which are the right paths to follow to ensure future
sustainability? In recent years, brands and global corporations have become
adept at adjusting their marketing and management practices to encompass
sustainable goals while maintaining a ‘business as usual’ style of trading. For a
corporation to operate sustainability in the present environmental conditions,
however, there is a need to chart new paths to meet environmental, economic
and societal goals (Bansal 2005). Stakeholder theory–which advocates the
importance of balancing the interconnected relationships between a business
and its customers, suppliers, communities and employees–has, since the late
1980s, become a dominant approach to managing an organization (Freeman
2010) and is closely related to corporate sustainability (CS). While corporate
social responsibility (CSR) has become an important element in most modern
firms’ management practices, Engert et al. (2016) argue that CSR is successful
at an operational level but less so when it comes to longer-term strategic
management thinking. They suggest that operational-level compliance on legal
matters, cost reduction, economic performance, innovation and riskpage 98
management are some of the key driving factors. At a strategic level there is a
bigger battle to overcome between ‘the existing technocratic paradigm and …
ecocentrism’ (Martinez et al. 2021). This means that the application of science
and technology to solve operational marketing and management problems
dominates while providing many positive outcomes but is not necessarily
solving issues or creating value-driven solutions for all living organisms on the
planet. Later in this chapter we will explore CSR and stakeholder theory in
more detail and see how firms are develop socio-sustainable approaches
towards marketing strategies.
Now read Marketing in Action 3.2.
MARKETING IN ACTION 3.2
Are Electric Vehicles Good for the Planet?
Globally, car and truck manufactures are racing to launch electric vehicles (EVs) and
participate in the rapidly expanding EV market for both consumer and commercial vehicles.
Here are a few examples of brands leading the way:
Volkswagen’s ID.3 is taking on a human persona with its ‘keyless advanced’ system and
headlights that wink at its owner. According to the promotional literature, the vehicle
seems almost human. Its battery performance offers a range of 180 miles from a 30-
minute charge and Volkswagen is committed to complying with the Paris Climate
Agreement to become net carbon neutral by 2050.
Tesla’s Model 3 puts safety first with an aluminium and steel structure. Technologically
advanced cameras, sensors and visual processing systems offer many additional safety
features when driving on busy roads, and the Tesla charging network reassures drivers
that they won’t run out of power on longer journeys, with a 340-mile range.
Rivian says its R1T is a ‘vehicle made for the planet’ and claims the natural
world is a stakeholder in the firm’s future success. This company is also
working in partnership with Amazon to build delivery vans and an exclusive charging
network for its customers.Source: jax10289/Shutterstock
These manufacturers are producing technologically elegant vehicle solutions, which offer
vehicle owners the choice of driving free of fossil fuels. However, a debate continues over
EVs’ green credentials, which pivots around the environmental cost of manufacturing EVs
and charging batteries, developing charging infrastructure, and wear and tear to roads. On
one hand, researchers agree that an EV will have a lower carbon footprint than will vehicles
with an internal combustion engine, as EVs eliminate fossil fuel use and GHG emissions.
On the other hand, EV batteries are regularly charged using power from electricity
producers, many of which continue to rely on fossil fuels for energy production. This
demonstrates how technology is leading EV developments while, arguably, electricity
production plays catch-up in the race to become decarbonized, and it may take until 2050 to
see the real impact on the environment of a switch to EVs. The dilemma for marketers,
then, lies not only in how to develop sustainable production methods for their EV models but
also in which of the vehicles’ credentials to use in their marketing strategies to achieve the
correct market positioning for their customers.

(2022); Volkswagen (2022)
Research (Peattie and Peattie 2009) says sustainability means looking at
the different contexts that influence a firm’s behaviour, and suggests three key
contexts/dimensions–environmental, social and economic–each of which
brings different priorities to the fore (Peattie 1999). More recently, Weng
(2015) suggested that two additional dimensions are needed–ethical and
technological–to give greater validity to the sustainability marketing
approach. Figure 3.1, based on Peattie (1999) and Weng (2015), encapsulates
all five dimensions.
FIGURE 3.1
The dimensions of sustainability and what they mean for marketingSource based on: Peattie (1999); Weng (2015)
Serious tensions exist, both between dimensions and within each
dimension, and the extent to which a company leans towards high- or low￾sustainability policies and environmental credentials will determine where its
emphasis is placed. For example, high-sustainability companies pay attention
to stakeholder relationships–for example, with employees, customers and non￾governmental organizations (NGOs) in the environment–engaging with them
in a proactive way. Low-sustainability companies will concentrate on the
traditional corporate model of profit maximization (Eccles et al. 2011), paying
limited attention to the sustainability issues they are legally mandated to
address. We will now consider each of these five dimensions in more detail.
Environmental: a dimension of sustainability
marketing
Weng (2015) argues the importance of taking a rounded approach to
sustainability marketing, and not to interchange and confuse this other with
other marketing practices–for example, ecological, green and environmental
marketing–that focus on specialist areas and come under the banner of
sustainability marketing. Arguably, companies should create their own
integrated marketing strategies to address a whole range of issues challenging
the physical world and the changing marketing landscape, and some do:page 99

impact of its activities on the planet

Ørsted, a renewable energy company, by operating entirely with green
energy.
Others do not. Coca-Cola, for example, falls somewhere in the middle as it
ranks high as a plastic polluter, with many of its soft drinks bottles ending up
as litter around the globe and in the sea. In 2020, the soft drinks
giant refused to get rid of single-use plastic bottles but pledged to
recycle as many plastic bottles as it uses, creating a ‘halfway house’ (BBC
2020). Many firms face organizational challenges and management dilemmas
when considering sustainability marketing, and their marketers can help by
recognizing changing consumer and stakeholder behaviours and interpreting
what needs to be done to achieve more sustainable approaches, and by
differentiating between green claims and greenwashing (Weng 2015).
To give better focus, guide and enforce environmental policies,
governments are also tackling environmental issues through the use of
legislation and target setting. For example, the Climate Change Act 2008
commits the UK to an 80 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2050, while the Paris Agreement (2015) is seeking to control global
temperatures. For companies, this means identifying sources of GHGs, such as
transportation activities, waste disposal and production. The Esken, formerly
Stobart, Group operates transportation and services to the energy, aviation and
rail industries, which requires the effective management of emissions. The
Eddie Stobart rail freight division, working with Tesco Distribution and Direct
Rail Services, helped significantly improve the efficiency of the movement of
goods, enabling Tesco to move closer to its aim of becoming a zero-carbon
business by 2050 (Stobart Group 2018) and winning environmental awards.
(Exhibit 3.1 illustrates how Tesco is marketing this achievement.) In some
industries, options for adopting greener alternatives are more limited. For
example, while aircraft are becoming more fuel efficient, electric- or solar￾powered airplanes are unlikely to be available for several decades. Airlines,
then, may have to stick to traditional corporate marketing and business models,
and to maximizing profits, rather than potentially deter passengers from flying
by raising awareness of the extent of aviation emissions (Tyers 2017). Etihad is
one example of an airline that has developed creative marketing solutions
around carbon offsetting through its Guest Miles programme, which sees
travellers encouraged to make conscious choices, use less luggage and donateair miles to projects working towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions
(Etihad 2022).

Some global movements are seeking to make fundamental changes to
production methods’ impacts on the environment and society. The fair-trade
movement, for instance, has focused on the impact of sustainability. To
become certified as a fair-trade producer, farmers must ensure they are
providing ‘decent working conditions, local sustainability, and fair terms for
farmers and workers in the developing world’ (Fairtrade Foundation 2018).
The fair-trade movement has invested in raising public awareness through
education and promotional campaigns, and has seen significant changes in
public attitudes towards fair procurement. According to Weng (2015), the
bringing together of sustainability and marketing could enable consumers and
firms to play a major role in shifting society towards a more self-sufficient
future.
Economic: a dimension of sustainability marketing
Economics focuses on strong financial performance and acts as the bedrock of
business activity; this dimension highlights the need for change in business.
Many firms see economic performance as their number-one priority and vital
to success (whether they achieve sustainability goals or not). However, past
unsustainable practices have begun to highlight environmental issues that will
eventually impact on economic performance. Research suggests the globalpage 100
economy could lose 10 per cent of its value by 2050 because of climate change
(Merchant 2021). For example, accessible reserves of oil and natural gas have
dwindled, causing prices to rise across many raw materials and manufactured
goods, while many sectors of the industrial economy rely on performing
activities that are economically rewarding but potentially damaging in
environmental terms. For some industries, social and environmental challenges
are difficult to address. Container shipping, for instance, currently contributes
around 2.5 per cent of the world’s total carbon emissions. Moreover,
international freight transportation is central to global supply chains, and
retailers in particular face many challenges when seeking to decarbonize their
supply chains, third-party transportation and consumer shopping journeys, all
of which potentially consume fossil fuels. Amazon’s operations
accounted for 51.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2019, a figure
similar to the total emissions of Sweden or Hungary (Doukas et al. 2021).
Pressure is therefore mounting for the transportation industry to find ways to
reduce and limit carbon dioxide emissions. In the UK, the Department for
Transport (2021) has a plan to make transportation net zero by 2050, which
means decarbonizing all forms of transport to cut emissions from individual
and company journeys, from cycles and cars to railways, maritime and
aviation. This is a challenge from an economic perspective, as road transport,
deliveries and travel are all predicted to increase as the economy grows and
recovers from the effects of the global pandemic. For individuals, more
walking and cycling and greater use of zero-emission buses may be a workable
solution, but for the rail, road freight, shipping and aviation industries, a huge
amount of investment is needed to bring about decarbonization. From a
marketing perspective, some companies have found ways to respond positively
to the challenges of sustainability. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and
operating in an ethical way are becoming increasingly important in the modern
world. Globally, companies are taking CSR seriously and responding
positively. For example, TNT (the Dutch logistics firm) started offering
customer in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, carbon dioxide￾neutral shipping options as early as 2015 (TNT 2015). Leading global
technology firm IBM’s philanthropic spending involves deploying staff to
work on worthy projects in the developing world, and ensuring its corporate
strategy builds value for its shareholders, customers and employees while
protecting the environment, respecting employees and building collaborative
partnerships (IBM 2020). In this dimension, climate events pose a greater
threat to humankind than ever before, and economists, business strategists andmarketing practitioners will need to find new ways to compete if they are to
succeed (Martinez et al. 2021) in achieving a net-zero economy.
Not all firms operate to generate surpluses for shareholders and investors.
Non-profit organizations attempt to achieve objectives other than profit. This
does not mean they are not interested in income, as they have to generate cash
to survive, but their primary goal is to deliver different benefits–for example,
to provide cultural enrichment (for example, in the case of an orchestra), to
protect birds and animals (the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the
Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), to alleviate hunger
(Oxfam), to provide education (schools and universities), to foster community
activities (community associations), or to supply healthcare (hospitals) and
public services (local authorities). While their worth and standing are not
dependent on the profits they generate, they must be financially viable. The
not-for-profit sector is gaining in importance, and even those organizations that
rely on government-sponsored grants need to show how their work is of
benefit to society. In the UK alone there are more than 160,000 charities; the
sector has an annual income approaching £42 billion and employs nearly 3 per
cent of the workforce. Many non-profit organizations rely on volunteers,
membership fees or donations, which requires the effective marketing of an
organization and its aims.
Non-profit organizations do contribute to the economy, as they provide
employment and strengthen communities; and, arguably, this sector creates and
supports a social economy. Despite the growing use of marketing in the non￾profit sector, it is interesting to consider the characteristics that distinguish this
form of marketing from that of profit-orientated marketing organizations.
Education versus meeting current needs
Some non-profit organizations see their role as not only meeting the current
needs of their customers but also educating them in terms of new ideas and
issues, research, cultural development and social awareness. Cancer Research
UK has big ambitions ‘to see 3 in 4 people surviving cancer by 2034’; to
achieve this, its aim is to generate significant revenues to spend on research
(£423 million in 2017), but it also invests resources in education, both in
learning resources about various form of cancer and through advertising to
reach a wider audience. Its ‘Right Now’ advertising campaign used personal
stories to illustrate the advances being made in research into the fight against
the disease (Roderick 2017).page 101
Multiple publics
Most non-profit organizations serve several groups, or publics (discussed
further in Chapter 13 under the topic of public relations), who form different
markets–clients and customers; volunteers; and donors and/or funders–and
build value through their non-commercial activities. Parkrun is a charity that
organizes free weekly running events that both athletes and families can take
part in. The timed events are organized by local volunteers and bring multiple
benefits, promoting health, community and friendship. Parkrun operates in
more than 23 countries (Parkrun 2022). During the global pandemic the charity
had to suspend its weekly events, which had a significant impact on its annual
turnover. However, the value it brings to individuals’ lives, their health and
well-being, through its free-to-all runs has seen many runners return post￾pandemic, enabling the charity to continue to grow.
Measurement of success and conflicting objectives
The success of profit-orientated organizations is ultimately measured in
financial terms. For non-profit organizations, measuring success is not so easy,
and decision-making is therefore complex. While both sectors are subject to
public scrutiny, public-sector non-profit organizations are monitored closely as
many are publicly funded from taxes.

MINI CASE 3.1
Not for Profit: The FA
Harry Kane is a top-rated athlete. He is a footballer who commands a very high salary, and
he is not alone. Footballers’ salaries have grown on average by more than 1,000 per cent in
the past 20 years. Football clubs finance these high salaries through match-day revenue
(approximately 13 per cent), broadcasting (approximately 60 per cent) and other
commercial activities (approximately 27 per cent). Premier League club revenue is
increasing in line with the massive wage bills and financial demands of the player transfer
market. While football is a commercial market worth billions of pounds, the FootballAssociation Limited (FA) (the governing body that sets the rules and regulations for the
game in England and Wales) is a not-for-profit charity.
Source: CosminIftode/Shutterstock
With such high stakes and volumes of money changing hands, the FA has to provide,
monitor and manage standards and discipline for the game, provide safeguarding standards
for young players coming through training academies, ensure opportunities for all and limit
discrimination, manage anti-doping through education, testing and application of legal
regulations, and protect the game, its players, supporters and many other stakeholders from
betting irregularities, match fixing and insider information. The FA must ensure the viability
of Club Wembley as a venue and centrepiece of the game of football. This is an almost
impossible task.
So how does the FA fund its operations and prioritize what it does?
Funding: The FA reinvests millions of pounds into the game in support of activities such
as grassroots football and the promotion of women’s football, and much more. To
achieve its strategic aims, the FA generates funds through its partnerships, both
commercial (e.g. Nike, Buildbase, Mars, EE, McDonald’s, BT Sport) and with other
charities (e.g. Cancer Research); other sources are grant income (e.g. Sport England),
broadcasting, sponsorship and licensing, and Club Wembley revenues. Investment is
directed to its strategic priorities.
Priorities: The FA’s mission is to widen participation in the game, promote diversity and
regulate the sport to ensure enjoyment for all. More specifically, its latest strategy aims
to give every girl the opportunity to play football, to embrace diversity among players
and teams, and to use the resilience developed during the Covid-19 pandemic as a
force for good. The strategic priorities are: to produce winning England teams in both
men’s and women’s football; world-leading education from the grassroots upwards
through coaching programmes; to expand the women’s game, and widen participation
and engagement across society; to improve the trust and efficiency of the game. To
illustrate the FA’s achievements against these priorities, there are now more women’s
and girls’ teams than ever before, attendance at Women’s Super League games has
been rising year on year, mini soccer teams have seen increasing participation by young
players and there are now more than 186 disability teams.
Sustainability: The FA has focused on ensuring major events at Wembley Stadium meet
the charity’s values, which means considering positive and negative environmental,
social and economic impacts. Arguably, the FA always aims to do good, but it facespage 102
many reputational challenges: political debate, when there is any controversy around
England’s football teams involved in major footballing events; football fans’ behaviour
before, during and after matches in the UK and overseas; scandals, media
exposure of contractual breeches and social media misadventures. All of
these bring the FA’s ability to govern the game into question. While the commitment to
the grassroots game is a laudable aim, there are falling rates of participation and the
cost of providing appropriate facilities is escalating rapidly. The FA clearly still has a lot
to do, then, if it is to be perceived as doing good by all stakeholders.
Questions:
Imagine you are the Strategy and Communications Director for the FA and you are
responsible for providing the strategic focus for the charity’s next sustainable marketing
strategy.
1. Review the extent to which the FA is achieving a balance in its application of
sustainable marketing contexts.
2. Using the output of your review, suggest changes for the FA’s next sustainable
marketing strategy, which will help the charity deliver on its priorities.

Despite non-profit organizations needing to consider different
characteristics, the marketing procedures relevant to profit-orientated
companies can largely be applied to non-profit organizations too. Target
marketing, differentiation and marketing mix decisions need to be made. Each
target market is quite distinct, and non-profit organizations should identify
benefits and clearly communicate the value created with their different publics.
Customers are relatively straightforward as they benefit from the products and
services offered. For example, Mary’s Living and Giving shops, which are part
of Save the Children, offer customers a unique proposition: boutique charity
shops that sell second-hand designer clothes and top-quality goods. Volunteers
are a more challenging market, and few charities are equipped to run
recruitment campaigns or have the internal management skills needed to retain
good volunteers. The main benefit for this target group is ‘making a
difference’, so whether it is a fundraising event, working in a charity shop or
helping to deliver good work, it is important for volunteers to have fun, be
given meaningful roles and be appreciated (Findlay 2013). Sport England is a
not-for-profit organization that relies heavily on volunteers in roles such as
marshalling a fun run, managing finances or getting involved in sportingpage 103
events (Sport England 2018). Donors need to understand why they might
provide monies to charitable organizations. They need to understand the
benefits and have trust in a charity’s ability to deliver on its promises.
Organizations seeking funding and donations need to target individuals and
organizations with an interest in the work of the charity. Non-profit
organizations often use ‘event marketing’, with events such as dinners, dances,
coffee mornings, book sales, sponsored walks and theatrical shows organized
to raise funds. Not all events are designed to raise funds for the sponsoring
organization. For example, the BBC hosts Comic Relief and Children in Need
telethons to raise money for a wide range of worthy causes. We have explored
some of the challenges and tensions in this dimension, so now let’s consider
the social dimension.
Social: a dimension of sustainability marketing
This dimension highlights the need for marketers to recognize change in
society, and places an emphasis on the reduction of inequality and deprivation.
In 2011, more than 2.2 billion people were living on less than $2 a day, but
progress remains very slow in moving them out of poverty (World Bank 2015).
The World Poverty Clock (see https://worldpoverty.io) shows achievements
being made in helping people escape from poverty in real time and targets are
being met by expanding social protection programmes, which foster
sustainable developments so when natural disasters occur there are better
survival rates (United Nations 2017). However, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO 2021a, 2021b) the global pandemic has slowed and even
reversed this progress, with many millions of people being pushed into
poverty. Falling incomes, job losses and tighter fiscal constraints from
governments, plus cuts to essential (non-Covid) health services have all
contributed to making life more difficult.
There are many charitable organizations that target social issues, with the
aim of improving life for segments of society. Save the Children is a charitable
organization that seeks to give children a healthy start in life and an education
to give them the prospect of a better future. The charity uses advertising
campaigns to maintain awareness of such issues, based on thought-provoking
subjects such as the war in Syria. During the pandemic, high-profile footballer
Marcus Rashford succeeded in raising awareness of previously little-known
charity FareShare, which focuses on the health and well-being of
children and families, and at the same time cuts food waste. Itredistributes food to charities, provides meals for vulnerable people and helps
community groups. Rashford promoted the need for action and change during
the global pandemic as an ambassador for FareShare (see Exhibit 3.2).

Malala Yousafzai is an educational activist who campaigns for female
education in Pakistan and around the world. The Starbucks Foundation focuses
on self-improvement and so partnered with the Malala Fund to create
educational opportunities in India and Latin America for girls and young
women, aiming to help bring an end to poverty (Starbucks 2018).
Organizations as diverse as TikTok, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and
the Musk Foundation also support the Malala Fund, which continues to use its
growing influence to challenge practices that preclude girls and women from
accessing education (Malala 2022).
Likewise, but at the other end of the age spectrum, Help Age International
is committed to protecting the rights of older people. Due to the wider benefits
of achieving social good, many corporate organizations are also finding ways
to get involved–for example, through philanthropy, community engagement
and many other social initiatives. Each firm, however, must balance societal
and environmental issues with its economic demands. Read Marketing in
Action 3.3 to find out more about this tension.page 104
MARKETING IN ACTION 3.3
State Monopoly Systembolaget: Taking Sustainability
Seriously
Systembolaget, a large Swedish retailer with 446 stores and 5,845 employees, is a state￾owned monopoly with responsibility for selling alcohol in a country where excessive drinking
has been a problem. The organization constantly monitors the changing world to ensure its
retail operation meets customer values about sustainability. To reduce both the direct and
indirect impacts of alcohol production and distribution, Systembolaget focuses on the supply
chain, climate-friendly packaging and social sustainability, by ensuring good ethical
standards and fair working conditions.

Social sustainability ranks high in Nordic economies. Sweden is relatively small in terms of
population, but it tops league tables in many areas, from economic competitiveness to
social health and happiness. Along with the other Nordic nations (Denmark, Norway, Iceland
and Finland), Sweden is seen as offering a blueprint for reform of the public sector and
delivering societal well-being. Soft factors, such as equality and social cohesion, are the
foundation of the Swedish economic model, and Systembolaget is there to help to change
behaviour around alcohol consumption. Upstream, the government has set clear goals for
behaviour change: alcohol-free childhoods, postponing the age of first drinking experiences,
providing more alcohol-free environments, preventing drink-driving. Midstream,
Systembolaget trains its employees to be expert advisers on alcohol consumption, while
downstream the individual consumption of alcohol is falling, as many 15- to 16-year-olds
change their behaviour and attitudes towards alcohol.
Systembolaget is positioned in the minds of its consumers as a brand that takes social
responsibility very seriously, and its sustainability strategy continues to focus on how tocreate value. The firm’s purpose is to limit the effects of alcohol on society, so it limits the
sale of alcohol. It manages to create value, though, by helping customers make informed
choices on the alcohol they do buy, to reduce the harmful effects of alcohol on customers
themselves, their friends and families.
However, tensions do occur over Systembolaget’s monopoly position when it comes to the
sale of alcohol, and it has been criticized for reaping profits from industrially produced wines
rather than producing more specialized selections, and pursuing a single goal to sell as
much wine as possible. So, it too walks a challenging path from a marketing perspective,
between delivering high levels of customer value and satisfaction and making a reasonable
profit.
Based on: Hagstrom (2018); Systembolaget (2018, 2019)
In this context, social marketing (as it is sometimes referred to) considers
consumers’ and society’s wider interests rather than short-term consumption. It
aims to rectify potential conflicts between consumers’ short-term needs–for
example, for fast food, which may contain high levels of fat, sugar and salt–
and their long-term needs–in this case, health (see Exhibit 3.3). The challenge
here for many leading global food brands–Kraft, Pillsbury, Procter & Gamble,
Nabisco and others–is that, over time, consumers have become addicted to
certain foodstuffs (with their preferred but less healthy balance of sugar, fat
and salt) and, while product sales soar, so does obesity. In the face of intense
media pressure, including the hit 2004 movie Super Size Me, which records a
film-maker’s descent into serious illness while living on a McDonald’s-only
diet, McDonald’s introduced healthy eating options including salads and
mineral water (instead of the ubiquitous cola). While cynics may view this as a
public relations exercise, the response of McDonald’s may be regarded as a
move towards implementing societal marketing principles and, perhaps more
importantly, as a sign the brand recognizes changes in consumer behaviour.
Recently, McDonald’s has begun testing a plant-based burger, partnering with
Beyond Meat to offer a vegan burger aptly named The McPlant, which has
been introduced to international markets (Sweden, Denmark, the UK, Austria
and the Netherlands), demonstrating that McDonald’s has identified Gen Z and
millennials as often preferring plant-based products to meat (Kelso 2021).

Critics of societal marketing suggest it is a short-term public relations
exercise that cynically manipulates a company’s stakeholders. Its supporters
argue that the stakeholder principle suggests it is in a company’s long-term
interests to support the long-running concerns of consumers and society,
resulting in a win–win situation. By combining sustainable principles and
societal marketing initiatives, organizations become better prepared to meet
the requirements of triple-bottom-line reporting, which considers not only
financial matters but also environmental and social issues.
Societal marketing seeks to change behaviour for the benefit of both the
individual and society, and its applications come in many different guises. For
example, cars are built with mechanisms to remind drivers to wear a seatbelt;
and there are social movements for wider change–for example, green and
climate change organizations, the consumerism movement, the international
campaign to raise awareness of the risks of drinking in pregnancy (see Exhibit
3.4) and social engineering (e.g. in Sweden, the government introduced into
schools a ‘say no to drugs initiative’ (Dibb and Carrigan 2013).
EXHIBIT 3.4
This campaign from the European Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Alliance uses shock
tactics to raise awareness of the risks of drinking in pregnancypage 105
Source: European Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Alliance
Of course, laudable social endeavours have to be funded, so there is an
inevitable link between social and more traditional commercial marketing.
Where the lines are drawn is not entirely clear, as some new commercial
products clearly exhibit social marketing ideals–for example, hybrid and
electric cars designed to reduce fuel emissions and the consumption of carbon￾based fuels, and fair-trade products aimed at helping their producers earn a
reasonable living. Marketing in Action 3.3 explores social marketing issues in
Sweden.
Consequently, organizations are now reflecting on and defining their
standards of behaviour by focusing on social marketing principles. Read Mini
Case 3.1 to discover the extent to which football is regulated by social
principles.
Ethical: a dimension of sustainability marketing
Underpinning sustainability marketing is the concept of ethics. Ethics
describes the moral principles and values that govern the actions and decisions
of an individual or group (Berkowitz et al. 2004). It involves values around
right and wrong conduct. Business ethics describes the moral principles and
values that guide a firm’s behaviour. Until recently, for many companies,
business ethics consisted mainly of compliance-based, legally driven codes
and training that provided details of what employees could or could not do
regarding such areas as conflicts of interest or improper use of company assets.
Now, an increasing number of companies are designing value-based ethicalpage 106
programmes that are consistent across their global operations. The aim is to
provide employees with an in-depth understanding of ethical issues, to help
them make correct decisions when faced with new ethical situations and
challenges.
These principles and values guiding behaviour within the fields of business
and marketing cover issues relating to elements of the marketing such as
product safety, truthfulness in marketing communications, honesty in
relationships with customers and distributors, and pricing issues. There can be
a distinction between the legality and ethicality of marketing decisions: ethics
concerns personal moral principles and values, while laws reflect society’s
principles and standards as enforceable in court.
Not all unethical practices are illegal. For example, it is not illegal to
include genetically modified (GM) ingredients in products sold in
supermarkets. However, some organizations, such as Greenpeace, believe it is
unethical to sell GM products when their effect on health has not been
scientifically proven. Such concerns have led some supermarket chains to
withdraw GM ingredients from their own-brand products.
Ethical principles reflect the cultural values and norms of society. Norms
guide what ought to be done in a particular situation. For example, being
truthful is regarded as good. This societal norm may influence marketing
behaviour. Hence–since it is good to be truthful–deceptive, untruthful
advertising should be avoided. Often, unethical behaviour may be clear-cut
but, in other cases, deciding what is ethical is highly debatable. Ethical
dilemmas arise when two principles or values conflict. For example, Ben &
Jerry’s, the US ice cream firm, was a leading member of the Social Venture
Network in San Francisco, a group promoting ethical standards in business. A
consortium, Meadowbrook Lane Capital, was part of this group and was
formed to raise enough capital to make Ben & Jerry’s a private company again.
However, its bid was lower than Anglo–Dutch food multinational Unilever
NV’s. Arguably, on the one hand, for Ben & Jerry’s to stick to its ethical
beliefs it may have leaned towards the Meadowbrook bid. On the other hand,
the company also had to perform financially in the interests of its
shareholders. Initially, Ben & Jerry’s faced an ethical dilemma:
on one side its values and preferences, and on the other achievement of
financial performance for shareholders. Ultimately, the fair-trade ice cream
producer accepted the Unilever bid, but as part of the original acquisition
agreement Unilever agreed to the retention of the management board and for itto take independent decisions about the brand’s social mission (Unilever
2021).
Many ethical dilemmas derive from the conflict between the desire to
increase profits and the wish to make ethically justified decisions. Unethical
business practices can have a very negative impact on customers, who may
stop buying a particular brand.
Positive ethical responses can benefit an organization’s market position
but, equally, unethical behaviour can lead to bad publicity and have a negative
effect on customers’ willingness to buy. Examples of behaviours having a
negative influence include: BA (price fixing), BAE Systems (bribery), BP and
Shell (oil spills in the US and Nigeria), Walmart (allegations of poor employee
relations), McDonald’s (health concerns), Coca-Cola (marketing positioning of
Dasani in the UK) and Procter & Gamble (Sunny D, the drink found to turn
children yellow). These examples bear witness to the importance of business
and marketing ethics, not only in their own right but also in terms of the well￾being of the organizations themselves.
Ethical concerns impinge on all aspects of marketing and how firms
differentiate from their competitors. Marketing practices have been criticized
by consumers, consumer groups and environmentalists, who have accused
marketing managers of harming the interests of consumers, society and the
environment. In this section, these ethical concerns are examined in relation to
the marketing mix. This is followed by a consideration of general societal,
environmental and political issues (see Figure 3.2).
FIGURE 3.2
Ethical issues in marketingWe now look at examples of marketing mix effects on consumers.
Product: product safety
Consumers expect products to be safe to use and are legally protected by the
Consumer Rights Act 2015, which means manufacturers and resellers must
ensure all products–physical and digital–are of satisfactory quality, fit for
purpose and as described. The duty of care falls on the supplier of the goods
and services, as they are responsible and the experts. However, there have been
many instances where it has been argued these guiding principles have not
been adhered to.
The tobacco, food and drinks industries have attracted criticism in recent
years regarding the potential harm their products may cause to consumers.
Tobacco companies have been criticized for marketing cigarettes, which cause
lung cancer. The food industry has been criticized for marketing products with
high levels of fat, which can lead to obesity, while in the drinks industry
concern has been expressed over the marketing to children of sugar-rich fizzy
drinks, which cause tooth decay and can also lead to obesity.
The fashion industry, especially fast fashion, has driven demand for low￾cost clothing. But, globally, events like the building collapse in Rana Plaza,
Bangladesh, which killed 1,135 garment workers, have highlighted problemspage 107
with unethical low-cost production methods. This tragic event put pressure on
manufacturers in the area to improve working conditions for workers, who are
typically paid less than a quarter of the wages of those in mainland China.
However, the region has duty-free access to Western markets, and the low-paid
workers have helped to make this trade a major part of Bangladesh’s economy
and export trade ($28 billion a year) (Reuters 2016).
In response, these industries argued they are taking steps to reduce the
harmful effects of products, with bans on tobacco promotion, and the creation
of bodies such as the Food Standards Agency (FSA, the independent food
safety body set up to protect public health and consumer interests in relation to
food in the UK) and the Portman Group (the industry-sponsored
organization that oversees the UK’s alcoholic drinks industry)
helping to raise awareness of social issues. Most European countries have
established similar organizations, which also provide advice to industry and
seek to guide manufacturers and retailers towards the production and
distribution of safe produce. Exhibit 3.4 shows the European Fetal Alcohol
Spectrum Disorder Alliance’s drink awareness campaign in relation to
pregnancy.
Pricing: price fixing and antitrust laws
One anticompetitive practice associated with marketing is price fixing, where
two or more companies collude to force up the price of a product or products.
Price fixing is considered unethical because it interferes with the consumer’s
freedom of choice and raises prices artificially. European Union (EU)
competition policy provides a legal framework designed to prevent companies
from carrying out this practice. The EU antitrust policy rules out two firms
making agreements that can restrict competition, and prohibits firms with a
dominant market position from charging unfair prices (European Commission
2018a).
For example, the European Commission has fined technology companies
ASUS, Denon/Marantz, Philips and Pioneer more than €111 million for price
fixing online, and breaching EU competition and antitrust laws. These
companies were attempting to control the price of their electronic products
(kitchen appliances, hair dryers, notebook computers, headphones) being sold
online and were found to be threatening to block supplies to retailers selling at
discounted prices. The manufacturers were also found to be using digital
monitoring tools to track their goods, to help control pricing (EuropeanCommission 2018b). Similarly, Google has been fined €4.3 billion for
imposing restrictions on manufacturers deemed anticompetitive. Google
required manufacturers to pre-install the Google search app, made large
payments to manufacturers and mobile network operators to ensure that only
the Google app was preloaded, and prevented the use of unauthorized versions
of Android (European Commission 2018c). Since the UK left the EU (on 31
December 2020), UK businesses trading in EU countries must continue to
abide by EU laws, although they are no longer required to comply with these
laws if they trade only in the UK.
Promotion: misleading advertising (puffery)
Marketers argue that, in most European countries, advertising is tightly
regulated, minimizing opportunities for advertisers to mislead. Misleading
advertising can take the form of exaggerated claims or concealed facts. A
claim that a diet product was capable of 1 kilogram of weight loss per week,
when in reality much less was the case, is an example of an exaggerated claim.
When Coca-Cola launched its bottled water brand Dasani in the UK, it
concealed the fact it was made from local Sidcup tap water. Consumers were
enraged and felt they had been cheated. A damaging media frenzy followed
and traces of bromate (a possible carcinogen) were found in the water.
Volkswagen was sued for making false claims in TV commercials promoting
its vehicles as being environmentally friendly and using ‘clean diesel’. US
regulators found 40 times the allowed levels of air pollutants coming from
these vehicles when tested in real-world driving conditions and the fines added
up to more than $30 billion. Volkswagen has also been fined €1 billion by
German prosecutors for selling more than 10 million cars in Europe with
emissions test-cheating software installed (BBC 2018b). Such high-profile
scandals, which meet with both consumer and media disapproval, are (or
should be) a major deterrent to companies contemplating taking a similar
approach.
The issue of the unethical practice of direct marketing companies entering
names and addresses onto a database without the consumer’s permission has
also caused concern. Some consumers fear that the act of subscribing to a
magazine or a website, or buying products by direct mail, will result in the
inconvenience of receiving streams of unsolicited direct mail or spam (the
online equivalent of junk mail). Regulation in Europe by bodies such as the
Direct Marketing Association (UK) and national governments aims to ensurepage 108
consumers are protected and their data are used and stored legally. Online
consumers are given various options to opt in or out of non-essential data
collection and subsequent promotional mailings.
Place: slotting allowances
Manufacturers promote their products and aim to outperform the competition.
Consequently, they sometimes offer inducements to retailers to place special
emphasis on particular products. A ‘slotting allowance’ is a fee paid by a
manufacturer to a retailer in exchange for an agreement to place a product on
the retailer’s shelves. The importance of gaining distribution and the growing
power of retailers means slotting allowances are commonplace in the
supermarket trade. They may be considered unethical since they distort
competition, favouring large suppliers that can afford to pay for them over
small suppliers that may be producing superior products. Marketers argue that
they are only responding to the realities of the marketplace (i.e. the immense
power of some retailers) and claim the blame should rest with the purchasing
practices of those retailers that demand payment for display space, rather than
with the marketing profession, which is often powerless to resist such
pressures. Tesco found itself in trouble over slotting allowances and
marketing/distribution fees, which had a widespread effect on the value of the
brand. The grocery chain demanded high fees from suppliers to position their
goods in prominent locations in stores and to favour their brands over the
supermarket’s own-label goods. But these fees raised the prices paid by
customers and allowed competition from discount supermarkets such as Aldi
and Lidl–which mainly sell own-label goods–to offer consumers a better deal
on a basket of shopping. Following substantial financial issues related to
overinflated profits from these types of rebates, Tesco is aiming to reduce the
fees it charges suppliers, although payments for prominent shelf positions will
remain (Economist 2015).
Ethical issues cut across the sustainability contexts we have discussed so
far in this chapter. Critics of marketing practices suggest there is too much
promotion of materialism, emphasis on the short term and limited concern for
long-term environmental consequences. Arguably, marketers should consider
the interests of consumers and society, and how they are influenced by political
issues.
Societal issues: materialism and short-termismMaterialism is an ethical concern associated with an overemphasis on material
possessions. Critics argue that people judge themselves and are judged by
others not in terms of who they are but by what they own. Marketers use this
trait to drive consumption. For example, status symbols such as expensive
houses, cars, second homes, yachts, high-tech gadgets and designer clothing
are marketed as representations of success and social worth. Such conspicuous
consumption is fuelled by the advertising industry, which equates materialism
and success with happiness, desirability and social worth. Materialism is not
considered natural by critics but rather as a phenomenon created by businesses
to drive sales and deliver high profit margins. Such companies devote large
marketing expenditures to these types of brands.
Supporters of marketing argue that sociological studies show how remote
communities in Africa–never exposed to marketing’s pervasive and persuasive
powers–also display signs of materialism. For example, in some tribes, people
use the number of cows owned as a symbol of status and power. Some
marketers argue that desire for status is a natural state of mind, with marketing
simply promoting the kinds of possessions that may be regarded as indicators
of status and success.
Accruing symbols of power is not limited to the physical world. Online,
the Facebook ‘Like’ button drives people to show their commitment to
individuals, brands and communities. On a personal level, self-esteem can be
boosted by garnering Likes: virtual ‘thumbs ups’ affirm a post as something
good (see Exhibit 3.5). The reasoning behind this is that receiving positive
feedback makes us feel good and raises our perceptions of our relational value.
Billions of Likes are generated every day; those who receive them feel good
and those who don’t can feel lonely and rejected (Burrow and Rainone 2017).

Marketing is often accused of short-termism–putting the immediate
interests of consumers before society’s long-term interests. As we have seen
when discussing product safety, marketers supply and promote products that
can have long-term adverse health repercussions for consumers. Cigarettes
may aid short-term relaxation, but they have harmful long-term health effects
for both smokers and those people forced to breathe in their smoke. Fatty food
may be tasty, but it may also lead to obesity and heart problems. Too much salt
and sugar in food and drinks may enhance their taste but can also lead to long￾term health problems. Look back at Exhibit 3.3 to see how recommended
sugar intakes correspond to the amount of sugar in soft drinks. Alcohol may
remove inhibitions and help to create a convivial atmosphere but may also lead
to dependency and liver problems. The UK has introduced a sugar tax, so
manufacturers must pay a levy on drinks with a high sugar content. Many
brands that target children with soft drinks have already reduced their sugar
content–for example, Fanta, Ribena and Lucozade (BBC 2018c).
Political issues: globalization
Globalization involves companies operating in many countries and is a term
usually applied to multinational corporations that exert considerable power in
their host countries. It is the abuse of such power that is of ethical
concern. Multinationals have sizeable marketing expenditures and
global mega-brands; concern is expressed regarding their influence over
consumers, governments and suppliers. Critics argue such organizations’ size
and access to financial resources make it hard for smaller rivals to compete,
and thus reduces consumer choice. The impact on employment and the
economy means governments vie with one another to attract multinationals to
their countries. Finally, the purchasing power of these brands means they can
negotiate very low prices from suppliers in the developing world.
Supporters of global companies argue that their size and global reach
delivers benefits from economies of scale in production and marketing
(making them more efficient and, therefore, in a better position to charge low
prices to consumers), and in research and development (R&D), enabling them
to develop better-quality products and make technological breakthroughs–for
example, in the area of healthcare. They further claim that their attraction to
governments is evidence of the value they provide to host nations. Regarding
their ability to negotiate down prices from developing-world suppliers, global
organizations need to recognize their responsibilities to their supplierstakeholders. This is happening as more of them adopt corporate responsibility
programmes and global corporations recognize the marketing potential of fair￾trade products (for example, Nestlé markets Partners’ Blend, a fair-trade
coffee).
Environmental issues: production and consumption
Production should enable the efficient manufacture of goods and services, but
production facilities can be a major source of damaging outcomes–for
example, air, water and soil pollution, and the destruction of natural habitats
and wildlife.
In the same way as businesses may seek the cheapest ingredients and
components to use in their products, they may also look for countries where
low-cost manufacturing is highly profitable using local workforces.
Environmentalists favour using sustainable resources, which may be more
costly due to being biodegradable or recyclable, and costs could also be raised
through providing staff with safe working conditions and good levels of pay,
rather than being exploitive. Doing good and making the right choices when
producing goods can be fraught with challenges.
Consumption is arguably driven by marketers’ desire to satisfy consumers’
wants but again there are conflicts of interest when it comes to the
environment. Consumers are given a confusing range of choices and marketers
do not always help: a brand may favour large packaging that gains the
attention of consumers in stores, whereas environmentalists favour smaller
pack sizes and refill packs. Eco-friendly labelling does not always help to
alleviate confusion. Lots of brands use the word ‘organic’ on their packaging,
especially on health and beauty products, and in the UK this market has grown
by 20 per cent, to more than £60 million. The Soil Association has accused
manufacturers of investing in marketing products that claim to be ‘green’,
rather than into R&D to produce toxin-free products. In the EU, beauty
products are not subject to the same stringent regulations as organic foods,
which means almost any product can be labelled ‘natural’ or ‘organic’, leaving
the consumer confused (Smithers 2017).
As consumer awareness of the impact of climate change and the use of
non-renewable resources grows, perceptions are changing and firms seen to be
taking a serious approach towards sustainability can gain commercial
advantage over those that do not take positive action (Barnett 2011).
Governments have tried to take positive action to reconcile business andenvironmental interests, and to benefit society and individuals–for example,
the EU’s LIFE programme has agreed €290 million for projects that will help
Europe become a climate-neutral continent by 2050 (European Commission
2021). Projects include Italian chefs promoting climate-smart foods and diets,
a Bulgarian project to protect migrating birds and a Polish project to find
renewable ways to cool buildings.
Changing consumption behaviour: SHIFT
framework
However, more needs to be achieved as the impact of marketing activities on
the planet is becoming widely understood, as a result of decades of research
from marketing and behavioural science, which has produced a substantive
body of literature. There is a greater urgency to change behaviour to reduce the
impact of consumption on the planet and its inhabitants. White et al. (2019)
suggest the SHIFT framework for understanding and encouraging
consumption behaviour to become more sustainable, and showcase challenges
for marketers (see Figure 3.3).
FIGURE 3.3
SHIFT framework: towards sustainable consumer behaviourpage 110
Source: based on White et al. (2019)
In the past, marketing has been accused of having a negative impact on the
environment by driving consumption (Peattie and Peattie 2009). Today, firms
are more likely to survive as economically viable businesses if they adapt to
the marketing environment and recognize the changing world. According to
White et al. (2019), the five big challenges presented by the SHIFT framework
that need to be addressed to close the gap between attitudes and behaviour are:
1. Social influence: Consumers are immersed in their lives and influenced by
their social norms, identities and social desirability. Social norms are
important as they provide clues to behaviour–the extent to which is it good
to reduce waste by composting, choose eco-friendly transport options, invest
in renewable energy. But marketers should be aware, while social norms can
provide powerful cues to use for branding, if target consumers are not
interested in a particular behaviour the outcome can be negative and reduce
positive actions (Schultz et al. 2007). Identities are shaped when belonging
to a particular social group, so belonging to or encouraging membership of a
‘green consumer group’ can mean an individual is more likely to receive
marketing messages about sustainable consumption (Schultz and Fielding
2014). Social desirability links to status and the capacity to make an
impression (Green and Peloza 2014). Booking.com launched a ‘Travel
Sustainable’ badge, which it awards to hotel and accommodation properties
that implement business practices that enable visitors to easily understand
how to travel sustainably and meet the local threshold, which may mean
water-reducing measures in areas susceptible to drought (Seymour 2021).
Together, travellers, accommodation owners and Booking.com are making
inroads into building a community that behaves in a manner that can deliver
positive benefits for all while travelling.
2. Habit formation involves repeated behaviour over time. Encouraging
positive habits is tackled in various ways. Discontinuing bad habits: for
example, meat consumption is a food-related behaviour that is not
sustainable in its present form, so farmers, food manufacturers and
consumers all must break their ‘bad’ habits and find more sustainable
options. Moving Mountains, a food brand offering plant-based alternativespage 111
to meat, aims to give a comparable experience to eating meat and in doing
so to encourage consumers to break the meat-eating habit (see Hidden Gem
1.1 in Chapter 1). Penalties: less about freedom of choice, but penalties,
government interventions like fines for dumping waste or dropping litter,
sugar tax on soft drinks and carbon fuels duties deter certain behaviours.
Making it easy is yet another habit-forming approach, for example opting
for an energy supplier that uses renewable sources of energy is more
straightforward than installing solar panels or a heat pump. Octopus Energy
(UK), Vattenfall (Sweden) and EDF (France) are firms supplying renewable
energy direct to customers. Prompts, incentives and feedback: marketers can
also offer rewards, discounts and gifts, financial rebates and pricing models
to encourage positive habit formation. Giving feedback on positive (or
negative) behaviours can also help (White et al. 2019).
3. Individual self: people can find it hard to change, and display biases based
on pre-existing behaviour. Their propensity to view self positively can result
in defensive behaviours, which can negatively affect the environment and
detract from those more inclined towards sustainable actions and behaviours
(Weber 2016). If consumers can be encouraged to adopt a positive self-view
of sustainability, they will be more inclined to take better care of the planet
and buy products linking to their identity (Trudel et al. 2016). Additionally,
seeing oneself positively encourages self-consistency. So adopting
sustainable behaviour once can lead to repeated good practices in the future
(Van der Werff et al. 2014). Self-interest is a facet of the framework, where
advertising appeals can be made to effectively influence behaviour.
Research has shown if sustainable behaviours, products and services relate
to an individual and show how they can fulfil their motives they are more
likely to be adopted (Schuitema and de Groot 2015). Demographics–gender,
age and education–are also a consideration when seeking to shape
individual behaviour (see Chapter 7 for further discussion).
4. Feelings and cognition: as consumers we tend to take one of two routes
when making purchasing decisions: emotional or rational. Positive and
negative emotions can affect behaviours towards sustainability decisions.
Positive emotions tend to come from hedonic pleasure, so engaging in a
sustainable manner can lead to consumers having a ‘warm glow’ that
enhances their consumption experience (Giebelhausen et al. 2016). If
marketers can frame environmental outcomes (resulting from certain
positive behaviours) as positive, they may give consumers hope. Using a
refillable cup when buying a coffee can generate these positive emotionsand encourage repeat behaviour if it is believed this will make a difference.
Negative emotions can deliver positive marketing outcomes but must be
handled sensitively so as not to scare consumers, for example advertising
appeals based on fear, which show potentially bad outcomes if a certain
behaviour is followed (or not). WWF launched an appeal based on fear to
encourage conservation of nature (see Exhibit 3.6). Guilt around behaving
(or not behaving) in a certain way can also influence positive sustainable
behaviour (White et al. 2019). Digital advertising generates significant
carbon emissions; a typical online ad campaign can produce 5.4 tons of
carbon dioxide. To mitigate this, advertisers can measure the impact of their
campaign, use high-quality carbon offsetting initiatives, reduce file sizes to
speed up end-user access, run campaigns at off-peak times, to produce
advertising that is good to the planet (Williams 2022). Making consumers
aware of the negatives of engaging with ‘energy greedy’ campaigns and
enabling them to receive low-carbon advertising could promote guilt-free ad
consumption. Also subscription services, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime
and All 4, offer advert-free streaming. A key to promoting eco-friendly
sustainable behaviours is through information (e.g. eco labelling), which
enables consumers to make informed decisions by creating advertising
messages that educate consumers and frame the problems to promote the
desired behaviour (White et al. 2019).
5. Tangibility refers to making sustainability real in the eyes of the consumer.
Marketers can aim to show the effects of positive behaviour using local
neighbourhood impacts. If individuals can see and experience the change,
they are more likely to behave more sustainably. The sharing economy and
the idea of collaborative consumption provide individuals with options for
using ‘idle’ resources, making the act of consumption less resource intensive
(White et al. 2019).

Applying the SHIFT framework to encourage sustainable behaviours is
complex and there are many options marketers might choose, but using the
ideas in each of the elements of the framework provides opportunities to
identify specific behaviours to target (White et al. 2019).
Having explored ethical issues affecting the climate and business activities,
we turn to the final dimension of sustainability marketing: technology.
Technology: a dimension of sustainability
In the technological dimension, innovation and use of technology is argued to
enable communication and education on sustainability and the creation or co￾creation of alternatives or solutions that contribute to greater sustainability
(Weng 2015). It is argued innovation can find new ways of doing things
sustainably if the focus of technology is on environmental solutions rather than
on economic projects. From a sustainability marketing perspective, technology
should be used to support sustainability and environmental agendas, and to aid
firms, organizations and governments to work together to co-create better
outcomes for the planet. Alternatively, if technology is not used appropriately
it can lead to deteriorating circumstances (Weng 2015). Smart technologies,
for example, are being developed to aid manufacturing processes. For instance,
if radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, used for tracking and managing
products, are manufactured with renewable paper and without the use of
chemicals, they can have a low carbon footprint. Firms need to use technology
to enhance sustainability through their CSR strategies and to ensure the
integration of sustainable development into every aspect of the firm (Saunila et
al. 2019).page 112
According to Vacchi et al. (2021), it is important for technological
solutions to leverage innovations in order to make changes that can reduce
climate change, as sustainability is a strong driver of change. For marketers, a
key organizational challenge lies in finding ways to integrate technology and
sustainability in a firm’s strategic planning and corporate culture. If this
balance is achieved, Vacchi and colleagues suggest, there is scope to produce
high earnings and margins for the company, more customers and access to new
markets. Currently, ‘Life Cycle Thinking’ (Toniolo et al. 2020) is a theoretical
framework used to consider all phases in the manufacturing of a product from
a sustainability perspective. Life Cycle Thinking can help decision-makers by
bringing together all the dimensions of sustainability marketing discussed so
far in this chapter, allowing social, economic, environmental and ethical
dimensions to be considered as part of a single process. This is illustrated in
Figure 3.4, which begins with the cradle, when the early-stage development
can be assessed to determine potential environmental and human impacts.
After that, internal operations involved in the manufacturing process and
distribution can be assessed in the middle ‘gate-to-gate’ stage of the process
before the final stage, ‘grave’, where the overall impact of the lifecycle of the
product is considered. Vacchi et al. (2021) add to the Life Cycle Thinking
literature by suggesting an additional assessment of the organizational impact
of technology on sustainability. The result is a holistic assessment process that
monitors technology-driven performance against outcomes on impact to
determine the overall value created by the use of technology.

Will Working from Home Save the Planet?
Source: Marish/Shutterstock
During the Covid-19 pandemic, many millions of workers did their jobs from home.
According to Timperley (2022), analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA) found
positive outcomes of this changing behaviour. Those who would normally commute to work
by car (more than 6 kilometres), who started teleworking, created fewer emissions even
with increased use of heating and lighting when working from home. The IEA analysis
suggested, if a fifth of jobs around the world were carried out at home, carbon dioxide
emissions could be significantly reduced, along with a reduction in congestion in towns and
cities, and a reduction in office-based energy consumption. However, a review of 39 studies
on the climate impacts of teleworking, by Hook et al. (2020), found not everyone agrees
because there are uncertainties to consider–for example, teleworking can lead to more non￾work travel in the car and greater use of public transport. Workers may choose to live
further away from their workplaces, so when they do have to attend, the journey is longer.
There are also fears that teleworking can lead to social isolation, impacting on personal
well-being and mental health. It might, then, be difficult to assess the real value of
teleworking, for either the environment, communities or individuals.

Practical Approaches Towards
Developing Sustainable MarketingStrategies: Corporate Social
Responsibility
So far in this chapter we have explored and discussed the dimensions of
sustainability, and the tensions, challenges and difficult choices firms and
organizations may face if they are to adopt sustainability marketing into their
marketing strategy. In this final part of the chapter, we explore corporate social
responsibility (CSR), which can help give a structure to what firms need to do
when striving to satisfy customer needs from a sustainable perspective. For
marketing managers, sustainability is possibly the biggest challenge of the 21st
century. Not only are there issues of what to reduce but there is also the
problem of understanding the real impact of any action. Research by Trucost
(2012) found environmental sustainability is at the top of most companies’
agendas.
Corporate social responsibility (CSR)
Many businesses now consider corporate social responsibility (CSR) a
baseline operational requirement rather than something optional. Business has
taken action to address ethical concerns in marketing and other functional
areas by adopting the philosophy of CSR. CSR has become increasingly
important and commands the attention of executives around the world. It
would be difficult to find a recent annual report from any large multinational
company that does not talk proudly of its efforts to improve society and
safeguard the environment (Crook 2005).
We shall now examine the idea in depth by exploring the nature and
dimensions of CSR and assessing the arguments for and against its adoption.
CSR is not new. For many years, companies have been aware of their
obligations as employers–for example, the town of Bournville in the UK was
created by chocolate maker George Cadbury to house his workers. George
funded the building of more than 300 homes in early 1900, and set up a trust
so his philanthropy would continue after his death (Bournville Village Trust
2022). Today, there is little doubt that CSR is high on the agenda of many
more companies than it was in the past. Most multinational corporations now
have a senior executive, often with a team of staff, specifically charged with
developing and coordinating the CSR function (Crook 2005). Furthermore,
most large companies engage in corporate social reporting within their annualfinancial statements, as separate printed reports and/or on websites. The
importance of CSR is also reflected in membership organizations that offer
services to members, such as providing information, lobbying and promoting
the CSR cause. For example, UK-based Business in the Community
(www.bitc.org.uk) has a membership of more than 600 companies and
promotes the prosperity of business through diversity and inclusion, good
nature stewardship, the circular economy, climate action and the promotion of
CSR internationally. Other notable organizations in Europe include Business
and Society Belgium, Finnish Business and Society, Business in the
Community Ireland, Samenleving and Bedrijf (Netherlands), CSR Europe
(www.csreurope.org) and the European Business Ethics Network (www.eben￾net.org).
CSR is based on the stakeholder theory of the firm, which contends that
companies are not managed purely in the interests of their shareholders alone.
Rather, there is a range of groups (stakeholders) that have a legitimate interest
in the company as well (Donaldson and Preston 1995). Following this theory, a
stakeholder of a company is an individual or group that either is harmed by or
benefits from the company, or whose rights can be violated or have to be
respected by the company (Crane and Matten 2004).
Other stakeholder groups–besides shareholders, who typically would be
considered stakeholders–are communities associated with the company,
employees, customers of the company’s products, and suppliers (see Figure
3.5). The key point is that stakeholder theory holds that the company has
obligations not only to shareholders but also to other parties that are affected
by its activities.
FIGURE 3.5
Typical key stakeholders for a companypage 114
The nature of CSR
A useful way of examining the nature of CSR is Carroll’s four-part model of
CSR (see Carroll 1991; Carroll and Buchholtz 2000). Carroll views CSR as a
multi-layered concept that can be divided into four interrelated responsibilities:
economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic. The presentation of these
responsibilities is in the form of layers within a pyramid, and the full
achievement of CSR occurs only when all four layers are met consecutively
(see Figure 3.6).
FIGURE 3.6
The pyramid of social responsibilitySource: based on Carroll and Buchholtz (2000)
Economic responsibilities Carroll recognized the principal role of a
firm was to produce goods and services that people wanted and to be as
profitable as possible in so doing. Economic responsibilities include:
maintaining a strong, competitive position, operating at high levels of
efficiency and effectiveness, and aiming for consistently high levels of
profitability. Without the achievement of economic responsibilities, the other
three are redundant, since the firm would go out of business. Economic
success is therefore the sine qua non of CSR. (Literally translated, ‘sine qua
non’ means ‘without which not’, which in other words means ‘without
economic success, the other responsibilities cannot succeed’.)
Legal responsibilities Companies must pursue their economic
responsibilities within the framework of the law. Laws reflect society’s
principles and standards that are enforceable in the courts. Occasionally, the
drive to maximize profits can conflict with the law–as with Microsoft, which
has faced heavy financial penalties both in Europe and the US for
anticompetitive behaviour (e.g. bundling its Media Player into the Windows
operating system, thereby squeezing out competitors’ software). Like
economic responsibilities, the meeting of legal responsibilities is a requirement
of CSR, but CSR is typically a voluntary rather than a legal requirement in the
UK.page 115
Ethical responsibilities Although the establishment of laws may be
founded on ethical considerations, as we have seen there can be important
distinctions, as with the selling of genetically modified (GM) products, which
may raise ethical questions and yet be lawful.
Ethical responsibilities mean that companies should perform in a manner
consistent with the principles and values of society, and prevent ethical norms
being compromised to achieve corporate objectives. Ethical responsibilities
therefore comprise what is expected by society over and above economic and
legal requirements.
Companies such as British Petroleum (BP) draw up codes of ethical
conduct and employ teams to govern legal compliance and business ethics.
BP’s code complies with a set of company values that focus on safety, respect,
excellence, courage and acting as one team, which encourages every aspect of
the business to operate ethically and legally (BP 2022). In 2010, BP’s
Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, causing disastrous
environmental damage. After the spill, a US Government report suggested BP
had a lack of focus on training and safety; the company’s values were brought
into question and BP’s ethical credentials damaged (Schwartz 2020).
Multi-billionaire, highly respected businessman Warren Buffett, Chairman
of Berkshire Hathaway, advocates that reputation is one of the most valuable
measures of success, and his famous quote, ‘It takes 20 years to build a
reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things
differently’, has possibly never been more pertinent as a guide for businesses
looking at ethics and CSR.
Philanthropic responsibilities At the top of the pyramid are the
philanthropic responsibilities of companies–these are corporate actions that
meet society’s expectation that businesses should be good corporate citizens.
This includes promoting human welfare, or goodwill, such as making
charitable donations, the building of leisure facilities or even homes
for employees and their families, arts and sports sponsorship, and support for
local schools (Crane and Matten 2004). The key difference between
philanthropy and complying with ethical responsibilities is that the former is
not expected in an ethical sense. Communities may desire companies to
contribute to their well-being but do not consider them unethical if they do not.
Philanthropic responsibilities are presented at the top of the pyramid, as they
represent the ‘icing on the cake’–actions that are desired by society but not
expected or required. Warren Buffett made a record-breaking $37 billiondonation to the Gates Foundation. The foundation, set up by former head of
Microsoft, Bill Gates, and his wife Melinda, aims to give every life across the
planet equal value, through philanthropic donations that support global,
development and health programmes (Gates Foundation 2012).
The dimensions of CSR
A strength of the four-part model of CSR is its realism in recognizing that,
without the fulfilment of economic responsibilities, a company would not have
the capability to engage in ethical and/or philanthropic activities. However, to
gain a deeper understanding of the scope of CSR activities, it is necessary to
explore its dimensions as well as its responsibilities.
As we have seen, CSR has four layers of responsibility: economic, legal,
ethical and philanthropic. By examining the dimensions of CSR, an insight
into where those responsibilities may be discharged can be gained. CSR
dimensions are based on four key stakeholders–the individuals or groups
affected by a company’s activities–plus the physical environment, which,
equally, can be affected by a company’s activities such as pollution or usage of
scarce natural resources, legal requirements (see Fukukawa and Moon 2004;
Maignan and Ferrell 2004) and peer pressure (e.g. competitors’ behaviour)
(Saha et al. 2020).
Table 3.1 outlines the CSR dimensions, lists associated key issues and
describes marketing responses for each dimension.

Please note that the key issues relating to each CSR dimension are not all
exclusively marketing related. For example, pollution control at a chemical
plant is a production-related issue, whereas standard setting for supplies is a
procurement-related topic, and the setting of fair pay is a human resources
issue. Nevertheless, for most of the issues listed in Table 3.1, marketing
practices can affect outcomes. For example, car design can affect pollution
levels and the rate at which oil reserves are depleted, and the creation of
healthy-eating brands can improve consumers’ diets through a reduction in fat,
sugar and salt levels.
Physical environment Key issues in the physical environment, such as
the use of environmentally friendly ingredients and components, recycling and
non-wasteful packaging and pollution control, were introduced in Chapter 2
and discussed earlier in this chapter. Marketers’ responses to these issues can
be summarized under the term ‘sustainability marketing’. Environmental
sustainability means to maintain or prolong the physical environment. It
involves action towards the use of renewable rather than finite raw materials,
and the minimization and eventual elimination of polluting effluents and toxic
or hazardous wastes.
Since marketing operates at the interface between the organization and its
environment, it is uniquely positioned to lead the move towards moresustainable products and strategies. Typically, companies move through several
stages (see Figure 3.7). To facilitate this process, marketing as a function needs
to address a range of questions, from the strategic to the tactical. Key questions
are as follows (Charter et al. 2002):
Have the effects of sustainability issues on company activities been analysed
as part of the marketing planning process?
Has the company conducted marketing research into the probable impacts
on the organization of sustainability issues?
Can the company modify existing products, services or processes to take
account of sustainability considerations, or will innovations be required?
Is the firm developing positive links with environmental groups?
Do communications strategies accurately emphasize environmental
considerations?
FIGURE 3.7
The stages in the move towards excellence in environmental performance

Responding positively to environmental issues is important in order to
protect and sustain brands. Market-leading brands are always susceptible to
attack by media and/or pressure groups following any environmental incident.
It is, therefore, sensible to build into brand strategies sustainability issues to
nurture and maintain brand trust.
Environmental issues can be a source of threats to organizations but they
can also provide opportunities. Toyota responded to environmental trends with
the successful launch of its Prius hybrid car, which supplements normal fuel
with an electric-powered engine. The electric engine starts the car and operates
at low speeds using a battery. At higher speeds, the Prius automatically
switches to a normal engine and fuel. This saves on fuel and is less polluting.
The success of the Prius has led many of its rivals to enter the hybrid and
electric vehicle markets (e.g. the Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe and Kangoo Z.E.
van). These models seek to put an end to all the myths about driving electric
cars and give the motorist energy-efficient driving.
The production of biofuels has risen dramatically as companies have seized
the opportunity to replace petrol. BP, for example, has invested £284 million in
biofuels. However, opposition from environmentalists may hamper further
development. They fear that carbon-absorbing rainforests in countries such as
Brazil are being depleted to make way for fuel crops such as soya and palm,
and that such crops are displacing land use for food, forcing up prices
(Macalister 2008). Detergent companies like Unilever have also embraced
sustainable marketing by producing concentrated soap powder that both helps
the environment and improves profitability. Environmental damage is reduced
because the product requires less plastic, less water, less space for
transportation, fewer chemicals and less packaging (Skapinker 2008). Procter
& Gamble has also promoted the benefit of low-temperature washing with its
award-winning Ariel ‘Turn to 30’ campaign, which raised awareness of the
impact of washing temperatures on emissions (Murphy 2008).
Social and consumer dimensions A social concern businesses have
sought to address is the need to support local and wider communities.
Consumer concerns include the effect of business activities on product safety,
including the avoidance of harmful long-term effects, the avoidance
of price fixing, honesty in communications and respecting privacy.
Although social and consumer dimensions of CSR are distinct because their
key issues differ, the two dimensions are analysed together as marketing’s
major response–societal marketing–embraces both. Whereas sustainablemarketing focuses on the physical environment, societal marketing relates to
marketing’s direct effect on people, both in the form of consumers and society
in general.
Supply chain Unfair trading arises when large buyers exert their power on
small commodity producers to force prices to very low levels. This can bring
severe economic hardship to producers, who may be situated in countries of
the developing world. Many of the growers of such products as coffee, tea and
cocoa live in poverty, and face hardship in the form of poor working
conditions, health problems and prices that fail to provide a living wage. The
fair-trade movement seeks to improve the prospects of suppliers through
ethical trading, including the guaranteeing of minimum prices.
Employee relations Poor employee relations can have harmful marketing
consequences. For example, US supermarket giant Walmart has suffered from
years of allegations regarding low pay and sexually discriminatory hiring and
employment practices–a situation it is seeking to address (Hines 2012). Bad
publicity can deter ethically aware consumers from buying from companies
that suffer such criticism. Walmart is frequently in the news headlines as it is
the largest employer in the US, with 1.6 million employees. Recently, in
response to changes in US health guidance related to Covid-19, Walmart
reduced to one week paid leave for those suffering from the disease, opening
the door for its competitors to follow. This action has been taken in response to
a shortage of labour across the industry due to sickness (Cavale and Naidu
2022). This move may be viewed negatively by the shopping public, but if all
retailers adopt the same policy they will be left with fewer options.
While most employee relations issues are the province of the human
resources (HR) function, marketing can play a role through internal marketing
programmes. Internal marketing is the development, training and motivation
of employees, designed to enhance their performance in providing customer
satisfaction. The idea began in service organizations such as hotels and
restaurants, where staff are in daily communication with customers, but has
spread to all sectors as a reflection of the need for all employees who come
into contact with customers to be trained in how to deal with such issues as
giving help, dealing with complaints and treating customers respectfully. Such
training avoids, as far as possible, employee–customer arguments and conflict,
which not only improves customer satisfaction but also is good for staff
morale, reduces stress levels and aids staff retention.CSR leads to enhanced brand/corporate image and reputation
One argument in favour of CSR is that a strong reputation in environmental
and social responsibility can help a company build trust and enhance the image
of its brands. This approach can help when a company is faced with media
criticism or regulatory scrutiny. Also, if a company is moving to a new area or
new market, or opening a new site such as a distribution centre, store or
factory, it helps to be seen as trustworthy and a ‘good neighbour’ (Sclater
2005). For example, BP has taken steps to reduce harmful emissions, and
Orange has enhanced its image through sponsorship of the arts. However,
brands should consider carefully the potential effects of corporate behaviour.
Online retailer ASOS has recently acquired collapsed high-street retail chains
Miss Selfridge, Topshop/Topman and Hiit Activewear; this has had a positive
effect on ASOS’s ethical rating, whereas competitor Boohoo’s rating fell when
it acquired Debenhams, Dorothy Perkins, Principles and Wallis, the underlying
explanation for the fall being unsustainable and exploitive practices of clothing
production and terms of employment (Tyler 2021).
CSR provides marketing opportunities Environmental and social
responsibility has created new markets for business-to-business and business￾to-consumer goods and services. For example, GE is expanding its marketing
of ‘clean’ technological goods to companies, and Unilever, which owns PG
Tips and Lipton tea, acquired Pukka Herbs, an ethical tea brand, to fill a gap in
its portfolio (Unilever 2017).
Market segments have emerged based on ‘green’ credentials that provide
targeting opportunities. One segment–known as ethical hard cores or dark
greens–researches companies and their practices thoroughly before buying
their products. These consumers view ethical consumerism as a way of life,
whatever the sacrifice.
A second segment–known as ethical lites or light greens–do their bit but do
not have the time to research products or companies thoroughly (Parkinson
2005). They are happy to recycle newspapers, plastics and other material from
their homes and buy ethical brands, provided there is not too much of a price
premium.
CSR increases organizations’ ability to attract and retain
employees Many employees are attracted to employers that are active in
social issues. For example, Net Impact (netimpact.org), a network of socially
conscious employees, has a membership of more than 100,000 people, andmore companies are seeking to build partnerships with it to help page 118
solve real-world sustainability challenges (Net Impact 2022). Some
companies, such as salesforce.com (an internet-based services company), have
a policy of good corporate citizenship (staff are encouraged to devote time, at
the company’s expense, to charitable works) that they believe helps to attract,
retain and motivate employees, and the leadership team see ‘doing good as
gaining momentum, which encourages a strong culture of employee
engagement in philanthropic acts and volunteering for good causes’ (Olsen
2021).
CSR is a form of risk management There are real penalties for
companies that are not environmentally or socially responsible. The media
criticisms of such companies as Nike (child labour in the developed world),
the now defunct British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) (toxic discharges in the
Irish Sea), Enron and Royal Bank of Scotland (financial scandals), and former
tabloid newspaper the News of the World (phone hacking) have shown the
harm that can arise from being perceived as irresponsible. CSR, then, can be
employed as a form of risk management that reduces the chances of being the
subject of the next corporate scandal to hit the headlines.
Research suggests CSR strategies should be an integral part of corporate
strategy. This means that strategic goals and all related activities need to adopt
the policies advocated. However, marketing managers can apply CSR to
different extents (see Figure 3.7), which, Galbreath (2006) argues, means that
different applications of CSR lead to different outcomes: the stakeholder
strategy focuses on profit maximization and so CSR is limited to compliance
with legal responsibilities. This would put a firm at the low end of the scale in
Figure 3.8. The proactive strategy, at the other end of the scale, creates a
relationship between the firm and its communities, and the company seeks to
give back, perhaps by donating surplus profits in line with social values
(Carroll 1979). This approach is about accommodating and accepting social
responsibilities. The reciprocal strategy looks at CSR more strategically and
sees it as good for business. Galbreath’s (2006) final strategy is the citizenship
strategy, which take a very proactive approach to CSR, integrating all
corporate actions into delivering sustainable approaches.

Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapter Detailed Review
1. Understand how the environment and society are changing the marketing
landscape
Impact of globalization: access to new markets, global supply chains, innovation
and inequalities emerging from the exploitation of different habitats.
Industrialization of agriculture and farming: feeding the world is increasing the use
of pesticides and crop yields, and industrial farming has led to deforestation, air
pollution and excessive waste.
Politics and climate change: political intervention, UN, climate change takes
different forms; there is much debate over how to tackle climate change globally.
Depletion of natural resources, waste or issues impacting on climate change.
Waste reduction.
Fair society, equality and inclusion.
2. Sustainability marketingpage 120
Creating shared values.
Individual and communities.
Employee.
The planet.
3. Explain the dimensions of sustainable marketing
Environmental context highlights sustainability.
Economic context focuses on strong economic performance.
Social context highlights the need for change in society, reduction of inequalities
and deprivation.
Ethical context: ethical principles reflect the culture and values and norms of
society; sustainable marketing is highlighting ethical dilemmas. Ethics describes
the moral principles and values governing the actions and decisions of an
individual or group. Business ethics describes the moral principles and values
guiding a firm’s behaviour. Marketing ethics describes the moral principles and
values guiding behaviour within the field of marketing.
4. Changing consumption behaviour
There is great urgency to reduce the impact of consumption on the planet and its
inhabitants.
The SHIFT framework presents ways for marketers to consider how to encourage
more sustainable consumption behaviour.
The SHIFT framework consists of: social influence, habit formation, individual self,
feelings and cognition, and tangibility.
Technological context: innovation and use of technology seeking to find ways to
do things sustainably. There are negative aspects to technology as it can cause
deterioration in and excessive use of scarce resources.
5. Ethical issues in marketing
Ethical issues in marketing relate to concerns about how the marketing mix is
applied to consumers, and more general societal, environmental and political
issues. Specific examples include product safety, price fixing, misleading
advertising, deceptive selling, invasion of privacy through direct and internet
marketing activities, and the use of promotional and slotting allowances.
Societal concerns focus on materialism and short-termism; environmental
concerns focus on the impact of marketing decisions on the environment; and
political concerns focus on the power global companies can exert on consumers,
governments and suppliers.
6. Practical approaches towards developing sustainable marketing strategies:
corporate social responsibility (CSR)
The main response from businesses has been the adoption of CSR as a
philosophy guiding decisions and actions.
Societal responses take the form of consumerism, environmentalism and ethical
consumption.
Legal and regulatory responses are the enactment of laws at European and
national levels to protect the consumer and to outlaw anticompetitive business
practices, and the establishment of regulatory bodies to enforce those laws. Manypage 121
industries have also established organizations to apply self-regulation through the
drawing up and enforcement of codes of practice.
7. The stakeholder theory of the company
CSR is based on the stakeholder theory of the company, which contends that
companies have multiple stakeholders, not just shareholders, to whom they hold a
responsibility. These include communities associated with the company,
employees, customers (including intermediaries) and suppliers.
8. Practical approaches towards sustainability marketing: CSR
CSR refers to the ethical principle that an organization should be accountable for
how its behaviour might affect society and the environment.
Organizations have responsibilities to ensure that economic performance meets
stakeholder requirements, operational practices do not break the law and ethical
principles are consistent with the values of society. Additionally, an organization
has a responsibility to be a good corporate citizen–for example, supporting good
causes and making philanthropic donations.
9. The dimensions of CSR
CSR involves five dimensions of organizational activity: the physical environment,
social, consumer, supply chain and employee relations.
Marketing’s response to each dimension involves responding to relevant issues.
Key Terms
business ethics the moral principles and values that guide a firm’s behaviour
ethics the moral principles and values that govern the actions and decisions of an
individual or group
fair-trade marketing the development, promotion and selling of fair-trade brands, and
the positioning of organizations on the basis of a fair-trade ethos
marketing ethics the moral principles and values that guide behaviour within the field of
marketing
not-for-profit organization this type of organization often employs a volunteer
workforce, and relies on donations and external funding
social marketing seeks to change behaviour for the benefit of the individual and society,
and its applications come in many different guises
societal marketing focuses on consumers’ needs and long-term welfare as keys to
satisfying organizational objectives and responsibilities by taking into account
consumers’ and society’s wider interests rather than just short-term consumption
stakeholder an individual or group that either (i) is harmed by or benefits from the
company, or (ii) whose rights can be violated or have to be respected by the companystakeholder theory contends that companies are not managed purely in the interests of
their shareholders alone but for those of a broader group including communities
associated with the company, employees, customers and suppliers
sustainability marketing focuses on reducing environmental damage by creating,
producing and delivering sustainable solutions while continuing to satisfy customers
and other stakeholders

MCDONALD’S AND ITS
PLAN FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL
CHANGE: NOT EVERYONE
IS ‘LOVIN’ IT’
Introduction
McDonald’s is one of the world’s most recognizable and profitable brands. The well-known
brand started out as a humble hamburger restaurant in the 1940s and grew to become a global
presence (McDowell 2020). It’s no wonder that the fast-food chain has become so iconic when
there are more than 39,000 outlets in over 119 countries worldwide (Elgin 2021). McDonald’s
reported that global revenues topped $23.2 billion in 2021, a 21 per cent jump from 2019, which
is surprising given the impact of Covid lockdowns. However, price increases on many of thefast-food chain’s products helped McDonald’s more than offset sharp price rises in food and
labour costs, and this helped to propel the company’s revenue in 2021 to the highest level since
2016. Profits also soared 89 per cent from a year earlier to $7.5 billion, so things are looking
positive for the ubiquitous brand (Creswell 2022).

However, in recent years, McDonald’s and other fast-food suppliers, including Burger King,
Domino’s Pizza, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Wendy’s, Pizza Hut and KFC, have come under fire
from a coalition of investors who signed a letter asking them to reduce the carbon footprint of
their meat and dairy supply chains (BBC 2021). These investors, facilitated by global investor
network FAIRR and sustainability organization Ceres, originally launched in January 2019 with
the backing of investors with combined assets of $6.5 trillion. Since then, the coalition has
grown by 75 per cent to include more than 90 investors with combined assets of $11.4 trillion,
signalling an increased awareness among investors of the threats posed to food systems by
climate change, water scarcity and water pollution. The fast-food giants were asked to de-risk
their meat and dairy supply chains by setting ambitious targets to reduce their greenhouse gas
emissions, to undertake climate risk scenario analysis, and reduce the water usage and water
quality impacts in their animal protein value chains (Ceres 2021). Since 2019, this global
investor engagement with fast food giants has resulted in fast-food companies ramping up their
climate commitments. McDonald’s became the first restaurant company in the world to address
global climate change by setting a Science Based Target to significantly reduce its greenhouse
gas emissions. These targets were set in 2018, prior to pressure from the investor coalition, as
the global brand wanted to send a strong message that it took environmental concerns
seriously (Liedke 2018).
A Plan for Change
For the past decade or more, McDonald’s has vowed to address the sustainability issue. As far
back as 2011, it helped launch the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, which was an
industry-backed group aimed at improving a variety of cattle-raising practices. Following on
from this, it made a commitment to acquire some of its beef from sustainable sources and, in
2018, pledged to reduce the climate intensity of its food and packaging by 2030 (Elgin 2021).
Then, in October 2021, it went one step further, announcing that as part of a global
sustainability drive, the fast-food chain aimed to lower emissions by about a third for both its
suppliers and its 39,000 company-run and franchised restaurants by 2030. Its goal is to achievepage 126
net zero emissions across its global operations by 2050–this means consuming only as much
energy as it produces. However, in the UK and Ireland, McDonald’s has set its net
zero target a decade earlier, and has pledged to achieve net zero emissions
across its UK and Irish businesses by 2040 (Burke Kennedy 2021). McDonald’s UK & Ireland is
leading the company’s global efforts with the introduction of the Plan for Change, which is a
comprehensive business and sustainability strategy developed by the global brand (Joyce
2021). The plan outlines the steps McDonald’s will take both now and in the future to support
both the planet and the communities it serves. McDonald’s sees this Plan for Change as a
business priority, rather than just a sustainability strategy. It is hoping to introduce many
changes to its business, changes that together with 1,400 restaurants, 130,000 people, 23,000
British and Irish farmers, and 4 million daily customers, will add up (Shaw and Eklund 2021).
The plan sets out ambitious goals across four key areas: planet, people, restaurants and food.
It is hoped that by making improvements in these four areas the company can lead positive
change across the business and beyond (McDonald’s 2022). In terms of the planet, as
mentioned above McDonald’s aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 across McDonald’s
UK & Ireland’s entire business and value chain. This will include the use of soy in ingredients
and animal feed in its supply chain that will be deforestation-free by 2026. In a further move
towards sustainability, the company announced that by the end of 2024 its customer packaging
will be made from renewable, recycled or certified sources, and by 2025 every Happy Meal toy
sold around the world will be more eco-friendly and consist of renewable and recycled materials
(Webber 2021).
When it comes to people, McDonald’s aspires to help one million people gain new skills and
open doors to jobs by 2030. As part of this, McDonald’s UK & Ireland pledges to support local
communities by providing a youth worker in every restaurant by 2024. The hope is that this will
make a real difference to young people by giving them confidence and skills, and helping them
make the most of their potential (Joyce 2021). In terms of restaurants, one of McDonald’s
initiatives in this area was the opening of its first zero-emissions restaurant in Shropshire, UK,
in late 2021. From its cladding, composed of recycled IT equipment and household goods, to its
restaurant chairs made from plastic bottles, recycled materials were used prominently in the
building’s construction. The restaurant is powered by renewable energy, produced from two
wind turbines and 92 square metres of solar panels on-site (Enjoli 2021). It also features a
biodiversity garden and nature trail designed by schoolchildren from the area, and a drive￾through lane that has been made from recycled plastic bottles. Other innovations include walls
insulated with British sheep’s wool, which might otherwise go to landfill (and which replaces
unsustainable synthetic materials), wall art made from recycled polystyrene cups, and EV
charging points. The restaurant is designed to be a ‘net zero emissions’ template and the plan
is that it could be replicated across any of McDonald’s new restaurants. According to
McDonald’s, the next step in its commitment is to ensure that all furniture in its new and
refurbished restaurants will be made from recycled or certified materials, and designed to be
recycled or reused (Robertson 2021). Finally, in terms of food, the Plan for Change included the
setting up of a Nutrition Innovation Council to work on developing more balanced menu options.
In 2021, McDonald’s debuted its first plant-based burger, the McPlant. It features Beyond Meat,
which uses pea protein to produce its patties. This was seen as a first step for McDonald’s in
offering consumers more vegan, plant-based food (Shaw and Eklund 2021).
Greenwashing
Despite, these efforts to become more sustainable, some campaigners remain unconvinced by
the company’s environmental claims and have accused the fast-food chain of ‘greenwashing’.
Greenwashing is described as the process of conveying a false impression or providingpage 127
misleading information about how a company’s products are environmentally sound. For
example, companies involved in greenwashing behaviour might make claims that they are
moving towards sustainability, when in fact some aspects of their business are not. Although,
some of the environmental claims made may be partly true, companies engaged in
‘greenwashing’ typically exaggerate their claims or the benefits, in an attempt to mislead
consumers (Kenton 2022).
Climate experts who have reviewed McDonald’s sustainability plans and data say the fast-food
giant is largely dodging the one bold step it must take to slash emissions: dramatically reducing
the amount of beef it serves (Perkins 2021). Beef production is particularly problematic and
harmful to the environment, due to the fact that cattle release high levels of a potent
greenhouse gas (methane) in their burps and manure. In addition, the amount of feed, water
and land that cattle require to produce a pound of meat is much higher than other animals, thus
inflating their carbon footprint (Perkins 2021). In actual fact, the carbon footprint of beef is
nearly 4 times the mean footprint of chicken, or 10 to 100 times the footprint of most plant￾based foods (Ritchie 2020). Beef represents McDonald’s largest menu category and
McDonald’s beef-centric menu is therefore affecting its environmental impact, with beef
responsible for about a third of McDonald’s climate footprint at present (Weber 2021).
McDonald’s is one of the largest beef buyers in the world, using 1.9 billion pounds of beef
annually, a mountain of meat that casts an enormous carbon footprint (Perkins
2021). At more than 53 million metric tons of carbon per year, McDonald’s
produces more emissions than Norway and that number is still rising (Elgin 2021). Stephanie
Feldstein, population and sustainability program director for the Centre for Biological Diversity,
called out McDonald’s for ‘nibbling around the edges of sustainability’. Feldstein believes that,
‘If McDonald’s really wants to create sustainable change, it can’t stop at plastic-free toys. The
company needs to overhaul its menu, put the McPlant in every restaurant and reduce the
amount of beef it serves too’ (Webber 2021).
The Future
These concerns cast a spotlight on the enormous challenge facing McDonald’s. However, it
looks like McDonald’s has taken positive steps towards dealing with these issues. Following the
limited release of the McPlant in the UK and Ireland in January 2022, McDonald’s confirmed
that the McPlant burger would be available in all outlets in the UK and Ireland (including
restaurants and smaller subsidiaries in retail parks and service stations). The fast-food giant
stated that the McPlant created enough interest, appreciation and demand for a full commercial
roll-out. The burger has become a permanent menu item, joining Veggie Dippers as the only
other Vegetarian Society approved option on the UK and Ireland menu. In addition, with
McDonald’s having signed a three-year deal with Beyond Meat in 2021, vegan consumers
anticipate future new releases (Buxton 2022).
Despite the positive menu changes, some argue that even if fast-food chains like McDonald’s
want to move further towards truly sustainable production, current consumption habits would
make that almost impossible. The real problem is that consumers are currently showing huge
demand for McDonald’s Happy Meals, Quarter Pounders, Big Macs, Triple Cheeseburgers and
other popular beef menu items. This begs the question of whether fast-food brands with beef￾centric menus can ever be sustainable. The fear for McDonald’s is that if it makes the move
away from beef, it may lose its customer base. However, as more and more consumers
become concerned with climate change and demand more sustainable brands, global
corporations such as McDonald’s may have little choice but to reassess their current business
models.page 128
Questions
1. Highlight the environmental and social impacts of fast food in general. Comment on whether
or not you think it is possible for fast-food chains such as McDonald’s to ever be
sustainable.
2. How has McDonald’s responded to public concerns about its environmental impact? Visit
the McDonald’s UK website to assess how the brand has responded to these environmental
concerns and shown commitment to a range of environmental issues. Do you think its
environmental targets are achievable?
3. A lot of focus is on fast-food companies’ environmental responsibilities, but do consumers
have responsibilities here too? Do you think the average consumer cares about buying from
a sustainable brand? What can consumers do to reduce their fast-food environmental
impact?
4. Why is ‘greenwashing’ seen by many as an unethical business practice? Do you think
McDonald’s is guilty of the greenwashing claims levelled against it?

UNILEVER: IN PURSUIT OF
PURPOSE
Introduction
Unilever plc is a multinational fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, selling more
than 400 brands within product categories such as food, ice cream, homecare and beauty.
Competing with other global giants such as Procter & Gamble and Nestlé, Unilever’s portfolio of
brands includes successful household names such as Dove, Magnum, Ben & Jerry’s, Lifebuoy,Domestos and Knorr. Thirteen brands appear in the top 50 consumer chosen brands in the
world as measured by Kantar Worldpanel, with three in the top ten (Kantar 2022). Unilever is
currently worth €52 billion and calculates that 3.4 billion people across the world use its
products every day. The organization employs 148,000 people to manufacture, distribute and
sell its brands in more than 190 countries (Unilever 2022d). As such, the potential impact of
Unilever’s products and how the company operates is considerable: on consumers, on
employees and on the planet.
Source: BalazsSebok/Shutterstock
Unilever has historically taken pride in recognizing this responsibility as well as the capability to
make a difference to society. Launched in 1894, Unilever’s Lifebuoy soap was developed with
carbolic acid to improve hand hygiene. The product was sold at an affordable price alongside
handwashing campaigns to help combat diseases that were prevalent due to poor sanitation.
Lifebuoy’s handwashing campaign has continued across the world, partnering with the charity
UNICEF and donating funds to support its social development programmes. Unilever’s
sustainable approach was formalized with a corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy in
2010 as the 10-year Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) was launched. This set out
ambitious goals for the organization regarding health and well-being, livelihoods and
environmental impact. Today, Unilever continues to actively advocate this strategy, publicly
acknowledging a responsibility towards multiple stakeholders.
However, amid a fall in share price at the start of 2022, Unilever received criticism from
shareholders who challenged its ethical approach, questioning the level of focus prioritized to
applying purpose to brands at potential cost to its operating performance. Indeed, as more
organizations bring ethics into their marketing, criticism has emerged of brands attempting to
make commercial gains out of social issues. Others argue that brands should be confident of
their intrinsic benefits and that pursuing purpose can dilute differentiation. As such, a debate
exists as to whether a purpose-led approach is always appropriate, or whether this can
sometimes be ineffectual, even damaging, if seen as lacking in differentiation or authenticity.
Consumers Seek Value in Ethical Brands
Rapid developments in technology have allowed accessibility to information and opinions such
that consumers are now far more aware of social and environmental issues. Increasingly
ethically conscious, they are knowledgeable about the actions that impact the planet,
supportive of diversity and less tolerant of groups being disadvantaged.page 130
Social media has played a significant role in this trend, with 78 per cent of consumers now
using consumer-generated media as a source of news and information (Kantar TGI 2020, cited
in Kantar 2021). Moreover, with global smartphone penetration at nearly 80 per cent, albeit
concentrated in western regions, there is easy accessibility (O’Dea 2022). Organizations such
as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have used social media to drive awareness of environmental
issues with engaging campaigns such as the Earth Hour event in 2017. WWF
claimed that this not only spread awareness but also trust, as users posted and
shared their own opinions (Gilliland 2017). Controversy also spreads rapidly on social media,
which can galvanize action such as the protests outside London Fashion Week in February
2022. These were shared alongside Twitter campaigns disseminating allegations about
unethical practices in the fast-fashion industry, calling out brands such as Pretty Little Thing (La
Manna 2022).
As a consequence, there are higher expectations of sizeable, profit-driven organizations and
their ambitions, and a demand for transparency. Unilever’s own study in 2017 among 20,000
adults across five countries revealed that more than a third claimed to be choosing brands
thought to be ‘doing social or environmental good’, while a majority of shoppers felt better
buying sustainably produced products (Unilever 2017).
A 2021 study in the UK by Deloitte highlighted that 32 per cent of consumers claim to now be
‘highly engaged with adopting a more sustainable lifestyle’, while 28 per cent have even
stopped buying certain products ‘due to ethical or environmental concerns’ (Deloitte 2021).
As well as emphasizing the responsibility held by organizations, these findings signify the
potential for return on investment for CSR strategies and other ethical marketing approaches.
To date, companies such as Unilever have been able to differentiate within their industry
through sustainable positioning, harbouring success in doing so.
A Sustainable Approach
The Compass became Unilever’s current CSR strategy in 2020 and continues a long-held
commitment to the organization’s people and brands in order to drive a positive impact. The
aim is for purpose to be at the heart of the organization and the company is proud of its 52/48
female/male gender balance at management level, and that 92 per cent of leaders are local to
their market (Unilever 2022c).
Unilever’s brands were committed to purpose long before the company’s CSR strategy was
formalized in 2010. The Dove Campaign for Real Beauty was launched in 2004 in response to
images portrayed in the beauty industry and the negative impact these were found to be having
on body confidence. Since then, a series of compelling communications have been released,
cleverly tailored to different markets and cultures, with an aim to improve the self-esteem of
women and girls across the world. As part of the brand’s social programme, volunteers visit
schools and Unilever claims to have helped more than 60 million young people in 142 countries
with self-esteem education since 2005 (Unilever 2022b). Nearly 20 years later, the campaign is
still running and the Dove brand continues to grow (Statista 2022).
The company is constantly innovating and adapting products and their production to be more
sustainable. In 2018, the Day2 brand was launched, a dry-wash spray product designed to be
used on laundry between washes to save water and make clothes last longer. Cif’s Eco Refill
bottle was introduced in 2019, the same year that TRESemmé, Lynx and Domestos moved to
detectable black plastic that would be more easily identified by recycling plants.
This commitment to purpose is not without controversy. Unilever has a code of business
principles in which it sets out a directive to working within legal and regulatory boundaries, aspage 131
well as the company policy on areas such as political involvement. When Unilever bought the
values-led Ben & Jerry’s ice cream brand in 2000, the US subsidiary retained autonomy to
preserve its social mission, famously campaigning for human rights. Powerfully supporting the
Black Lives Matter movement, it called to ‘dismantle white supremacy’, while in July 2021, the
brand felt that distributing its products in Israeli-occupied Palestinian areas was against its
values and withdrew sales. This led to political tension between Unilever and Israel’s prime
minister, and divestments from US pension funds. Ben & Jerry’s CEO Matthew McCarthy
maintains that ‘we do these things not to sell more ice cream but because we care about
people and have values’ (Beard 2021). Nevertheless, results are strong, with the ice cream
brand achieving 9 per cent growth in 2021 (Naidu and Kerber 2022).
In 2019, Unilever announced that its purpose-led brands were growing 69 per cent faster than
the rest of the business and delivering 75 per cent of the company’s growth. As a result, CEO
Alan Jope asserted, ‘we believe the evidence is clear and compelling that brands with purpose
grow. In fact, we believe this so strongly that we are prepared to commit that in the future, every
Unilever brand will be a brand with purpose’ (Unilever 2019a). In 2021, chief sustainability
officer, Rebecca Marmot, reiterated this sentiment, talking of how the latest CSR (Compass)
strategy ‘lays the pathway for us … to prove once and for all that sustainable business drives
superior business performance’ (Marmot 2021).
Indeed, Unilever brands have recently reviewed long-standing communication to demonstrate
more relevance and purpose. In 2020, laundry brand Omo (Persil in the UK) adapted its ‘Dirt is
Good’ campaign after more than 10 years of encouraging children to play outside
and get dirty. The new campaign is a more pointed call to get active to make a
difference.
Many organizations are now adopting CSR strategies and incorporating purposeful positioning
into their brands. Starbucks is a notable example, with its focus on the sustainability of coffee
farming, while McDonald’s has set out some ambitious targets in its 2020 CSR Framework, with
a commitment to providing a healthier product offering as well as sourcing ingredients more
sustainably. While these initiatives are logical, relevant strategies for these businesses, other
demonstrations of purpose have been less warmly received.
In 2019, UK retailer Marks & Spencer (M&S) launched an LGBT+ sandwich to celebrate Pride
month and raise money for charity. The move was criticized for being demeaning and simply
seeking commercial gain. A member of the public tweeted, ‘these companies are really just
taking any swing to seem “inclusive”’; another said ‘equating us to a sandwich? I can’t imagine
them doing this with other marginalized groups’ (Young 2019).
As more organizations and brands assume an ethical focus, some people question whether this
is always the right thing to do.
Challenging the Purposeful Approach
As mentioned above, in January 2022 Unilever was criticized by shareholders for prioritizing
purpose over operating performance. In his annual letter to his investors, CEO of key
shareholder Fundsmith LLP, Terry Smith, criticized the business for being ‘obsessed with
publicly displaying sustainability credentials at the expense of focusing on the fundamentals of
the business’. He cited ‘ludicrous’ examples, challenging one of Unilever’s iconic brands,
Hellmann’s mayonnaise, as to the need to spend precious time creating a purpose for a brand
that has existed since 1913: ‘we would guess that by now consumers have figured out its
purpose (spoiler alert–salads and sandwiches)’ (Smith 2022, p.3). The previous year, the CEOpage 132
of French company Danone, Emmanuel Faber, stepped down after shareholders claimed he
had neglected their interests in his pursuit of responsible capitalism (Evans and Agnew 2022).
As well as the challenge of satisfying different stakeholders with an ethical approach, other
assessments have emerged as to its use in marketing. Academic and author Byron Sharp
argues that a purpose route is easy to replicate and can actually lead to less differentiation. He
questions the need for marketers to create a greater purpose rather than simply focusing on the
brand benefit, suggesting that they have become ‘squeamish about “only selling soap” … but
soap is good’, urging them to act more confidently (Jefferson 2021).
Muhr and Egan-Wyer (2014) even suggested an incompatibility of ethics and capitalism,
explaining that in pursuing an ethical approach, corporations are turning human principles into
‘a strategic resource to be exploited’.
Moreover, others question the authenticity behind some brand messaging, ranging from
dubious claims about green credentials, to clumsily supporting societal groups and issues with
questionable relevance to the brand. A recent Kantar media trends report warned of
inauthenticity in this area alienating consumers, citing the example of Pepsi’s backlash in 2017
resulting from Kendall Jenner appearing in an advertisement that appeared to trivialize the
Black Lives Matter movement (Kantar 2021). Indeed, Unilever’s Alan Jope has been openly
critical of ‘woke washing’ and the damage it can do to trust (Unilever 2019a).
For organizations like Unilever, which have made a public commitment to sustainability across
the business, there are clear challenges to pursuing this strategy. Stakeholder views may
contrast and be hard to satisfy, while consumers are able to see through attempts to greenwash
them, and actions could even be damaging.
The question for Unilever, and indeed all organizations, is one that needs careful consideration:
is a purpose-led approach always the most appropriate option?
Questions
1. Describe the issues in the current global environment that provide challenges for marketers
with regard to ethical considerations. Why might these be greater for companies such as
Unilever?
2. Evaluate the extent to which Unilever is meeting responsibilities at every level of Carroll’s
four-part model of CSR, and therefore reaching full achievement of this strategy according
to the model. Provide evidence to support your argument.
3. Identify the different stakeholder groups that have an interest in the activities of
Unilever as a company. Explain the potential tensions between these groups
that would create challenges for Unilever in following the stakeholder theory.
4. Discuss the challenges that Unilever faces in pursuing a purpose-led approach across its
entire portfolio of brands. What action do you think the company should take going forward
with regard to these challenges?

n this chapter our focus is on customers. Business-to-consumer (B2C) and
business-to-business (B2B) markets create two major categories where the
basic principles of marketing apply, but there are some significant
differences to recognize. Broadly, in B2C markets consumers purchase
products and services for their own use, in small quantities, and their needs,
wants and motivations are personal. Key markets for consumer purchasing are:fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), where costs are relatively low and
products are frequently bought, for example groceries, stationery, cosmetics;
semi-durable goods, products which last longer, for example clothing,
household goods, jewellery; and durable consumer goods, a category in which
customers are looking for products that have extended life, for example cars,
refrigerators, computers.
In B2B markets buyers have considerable purchasing power as they buy in
bulk and will be trained to develop expertise and skills in purchasing practices.
These professional buyers will make purchase decisions based on derived
demand (needs identified within the organization) or capital equipment needed
for organizational use. Selling to professional buyers is different to selling to
consumers: professional buyers will negotiate on factors like price, quality,
performance, delivery and service. The main markets for B2B purchasing are:
supplies and consumables; raw materials, components; goods for retail
distribution; capital equipment and business services (Jobber and Lancaster
2019).
We begin the chapter with consumer behaviour and three key areas for
understanding implications for marketing: context, dimensions and buying
processes, and influences on consumer behaviour.
The Changing Context of Consumer
Behaviour
Consumer markets are in a state of continuous change, and marketers need to
understand the new and emerging contexts in which they operationalize their
marketing activities. For example, widespread adoption of digital technologies
has connected individuals in a way not conceived as possible a decade ago. An
outcome is the emergence of a digital global consumer culture that overlays
and affects localized lifestyles, attitudes and behaviours. While details of these
contexts largely go beyond the aims of this chapter it is important to be aware
of the following factors:
Global consumer culture is shaping cultural values, and the extent to which
consumers conform to cultural norms can significantly affect how
individuals respond to marketing activities (Sobol et al. 2018). Marketers
increasingly need to understand both local and the global nuances of apage 135
market, and to identify aspects of these markets that may influence
consumer behaviour. This means they should consider ‘how individuals
acquire the knowledge, skills and behaviours’ that shape the culture in
which they live (Cleveland and Laroche 2007). Global consumer culture and
the connection to digital technology is occurring in response to widespread
exposure to global mass media, whose coverage has expanded rapidly
through satellite TV and digital channels, around the world, so individuals
can listen to the same music, watch the same entertainment shows and
access the same news.
Increased exposure to global corporations’ marketing efforts: many brands
have adapted product names to fit with multinational understanding, for
example the Swedish chocolate bar Dime became Daim to be recognized in
wider European markets. Jif, a UK cleaning product, was renamed Cif to
enable it to become a global brand. However, soft drink Sprite is called
Xuebi in China as the name has a better meaning locally. Greater social
mobility and travel facilitates exposure to different cultures (for further
discussion of globalization and marketing, see Chapter 20).
Co-creation of value occurs as firms seek to differentiate their offers and
make them stand out. Increasingly, firms are collaborating and getting into
conversations with their customers online and offline to create experiences
that complement products and services (Anshu et al. 2022). In essence,
markets become forums that facilitate value creation (Prahalad and
Ramaswamy 2004) and the focus becomes more customer-centric. For
example, home appliance brand Whirlpool’s Everyday Care campaign
encouraged consumers to get involved by sharing their stories and thoughts
via Twitter. These interactions enabled Whirlpool brand managers to
discover the importance of clean clothes leading to better school attendance,
so they provided washers and dryers to schools (Smiley 2016). For co￾creation to succeed, a firm should offer its customers the opportunity to co￾build a service experience to suit individual needs and produce value. To do
this, marketing managers need to understand how customers can contribute
to the value of a brand and assess the actual value of the co-creation (Merz
et al. 2018). Online it is important to acknowledge the customer experience
as a critical dimension of value creation, as it affects attitudes and
repurchase intentions. For example, customers enjoy doorstep
deliveries but can become anxious about delivery times and the whereabouts
of products, so involving them in creating value through more efficient
delivery services can benefit all (Anshu et al. 2022). Co-creation of value isa fundamental element of service-dominant logic and is discussed in further
detail in Chapter 5.
Online consumer behaviour: digital and social medial advertising spend has
grown year on year and now exceeds spending on traditional media (e.g.
print, TV, radio) (Rogers and McDonald 2020). Web, social media and
mobile channels are connecting consumers to marketing messages and
altering how they engage with firms. Digital natives are ‘anytime,
anywhere’ and ‘always on’ consumers, from communications, to purchasing
and posting reviews (Chiu et al. 2014). Smartphones are facilitating even
stronger connections to social medial and digital content, with many
consumers checking their phones every few minutes of the day. Kietzmann
et al. (2011) developed a honeycomb framework showing the building
blocks of social media–sharing content, creating a presence, having
conversations, developing connected relationships, joining groups, building
reputations and revealing identities–each block having different implications
for marketing. Individuals are developing online identities, which enable the
creation of online personas and an extension of self (Stephen 2016). Monikh
Dale (https://monikh.com), for instance, graduated in fashion design in
London before becoming a full-time influential fashion blogger by sharing
new brands and designer wear. These issues are discussed in further detail in
Chapter 14.
As the marketing environment changes so does our purchasing behaviour.
Consumers are eating more convenience foods and also less meat; more family
members are working to pay household bills and there are more single-person
households, which means convenience is a high priority for many people
(Costa et al. 2007; ONS 2022). Consumers are also getting heavier–
worldwide, 1.9 billion adults are overweight and, in 2020, 39 million children
under the age of five were classified as overweight or obese (World Health
Organization 2021)–and this influences what they buy. The likelihood of
buying healthy convenience foods is affected by overall liking of particular
foods, for example chicken meals are favoured over salmon (Olsen et al.
2012). Nevertheless, tracking changing consumer behaviours is becoming
easier as technology is enabling sophisticated analysis of every aspect of the
consumer decision-making process. Hidden Gem 4.1 explains how Swedish
technology company Tobii is using eye-tracking.page 136
HIDDEN GEM 4.1
Tobii Leads the Way in Eye-tracking and Attention
Computing
John Elvesjö, Mårten Skogö and Henrik Eskilsson, three Swedish entrepreneurs, had an
idea of how eye-tracking technology might transform industries and lives through better
understanding of human behaviour, and in 2001 set up Tobii. The partners began
developing innovative ‘plug and play’ eye-trackers and by 2005 had developed a world first:
an eye-controlled computer, which allowed people with disabilities to communicate through
computers using just their eyes.
Source: MaximP/Shutterstock
Tobii’s reputation as an innovative company grew and the firm expanded into international
markets in the US and Asia. In 2014, an eye-tracking platform for use in consumer devices
was launched, with application opportunities across healthcare, education, money and other
industrial sectors, and the firm became a world leader in assistive communication
technology. Another world first was the launch of a gaming computer with built-in eye￾tracking, which opened up access to consumer markets. This was followed by virtual reality
headsets, wearable eye-tracker glasses and the launch of the Tobii Eye Tracker 5 to
enhance the gaming experience.
Today the focus on innovation continues as Tobii enters the driving marketing with its Driver
Monitoring System, which monitors driver attention and drowsiness to enhance traffic safety.
The system brings the driver closer to the vehicle through the application of technology. In
the future the firm is planning more technology applications which will enable
technology to work with natural human behaviour, and it has recently partnered
with LIV (the leader in XR game streaming) and avatar platform Ready Player Me to create
avatars for the metaverse, which are more expressive and humanlike in their behaviour.

The Dimensions of Consumer
Behaviour
Consumer behaviour is a highly complex set of processes, and our
understanding of the subject is shaped by consumer psychology and theories of
human behaviour, which are extensive subject areas. In this chapter we explore
key principles and ideas shaping marketers’ understanding of how consumers
behave.
Consumers are individuals who buy products or services for personal
consumption. Organizational buying focuses on the purchase of products and
services for use in an organization’s activities. The distinction is important, but
sometimes it is difficult to classify a product as being either a consumer or an
organizational good. Cars, for example, sell to consumers for personalpage 137
consumption and to organizations for use in carrying out their activities (e.g. to
provide transport for a sales executive).
However, for both types of buyer, an understanding of customers can be
gained by answering the following questions (see also Figure 4.1):
Who is important in the buying decision?
How do they buy?
What are their choice criteria?
Where do they buy?
When do they buy?
FIGURE 4.1
Understanding consumers: the key questions
These questions help define the key dimensions of behaviour (and are
relevant to both consumer and organizational purchasers). Understanding the
dimensions identified by these questions is important and has implications for
different levels of marketing planning. There is an additional question to
consider: why do they buy? For example, looking at how consumers buy
through analysis of their needs recognition and problem awareness also reveals
why consumers may decide on a particular purchase; discussion of choice
criteria gives clues as to why one consumer may choose a Honda Jazz because
of its (competitive) price and fuel economy, while another may choose a
Mercedes S-Class for its perceived status. Exploring the influence of
personality may explain why an extrovert may choose Coca-Cola, as it is a
brand seeking to please everyone, while an introvert may choose
Dettol cleaning wipes, which promise ‘sensitive personal care’
and a more individually pleasing offer. The issue of why consumers buy is nottreated separately as it cuts across the above questions and is integrated into
the following sections.
Who buys?
Many consumer purchases are individual. For instance, buying a Snickers (one
of the bestselling chocolate bars in the world, with sales of 400 million units
per year) is often an impulse purchase resulting from seeing a display of
confectionery in a food store or at a fuel station. However, decision-making
can also be done by a group such as a household. In this situation, several
individuals interact to influence the purchase decision. Each person may
assume a role in the decision-making process. Blackwell et al. (2005) describe
five roles, as outlined below, each of which may be taken on by a parent, child
or other member of the buying centre:
1. Initiator: the person who begins the process of considering a purchase.
Information may be gathered by this person to help the decision.
2. Influencer: the person who attempts to persuade others in the group
concerning the outcome of the decision. Influencers typically gather
information and attempt to impose their choice criteria on the decision.
3. Decider: the individual with the power and/or financial authority to make
the ultimate choice regarding which product to buy.
4. Buyer: the person who conducts the transaction. The buyer calls the
supplier, visits the store, makes the payment and effects delivery.
5. User: the actual consumer/user of the product.
One person may assume multiple roles in the buying group. In a smart TV
purchase, for example, a teenage boy may be the initiator and attempt to
influence his parents, who are the deciders. The boy may be influenced by his
elder brother to buy a different brand to the one he initially preferred. The
buyer may be one of the parents, who visits the store to purchase the smart TV
and brings it back to the home. Finally, the whole family may be users of the
TV. Although in this example the purchase was initiated by one person,
marketers have four differing viewpoints–both parents, the teenager and his
older sibling–that may affect the outcome of the purchase decision. The
respective roles in a buying group may change during the purchasing process.
The internet is also having an influence on consumer behaviour.An implication of understanding who buys in identification of the roles
played within the buying centre is a prerequisite for targeting persuasive
communications. As the previous discussion has demonstrated, the person who
consumes the product may not be the most influential member of the buying
centre, nor the decision-maker. Even when the user does play the predominant
role, communication with other members of the buying centre can make sense
when their knowledge and opinions may act as persuasive forces during the
decision-making process.
How they buy
How consumers buy may be regarded as a decision-making process beginning
with the recognition that a problem exists. For example, a Fitbit personal
activity tracker may be bought to solve a perceived problem of an unhealthy
lifestyle. Problem-solving may thus be considered a thoughtful reasoned action
undertaken to bring about need satisfaction. Blackwell et al. (2005) define a
series of steps a consumer may pass through before choosing a brand, based on
the Engel Kollatt Blackwell Model of consumer decision-making and still
highly relevant in digital consumer decision-making (Ashman et al. 2015).
Figure 4.2 shows these stages, which form the consumer decision-making
process. This process is shown as a set of linear steps, which lead to a
purchase. It is important to understand each stage before considering how this
process is influenced by the emerging contexts in which consumer behaviour
takes place.
FIGURE 4.2
The consumer decision-making processpage 138
Need recognition/problem awareness
Awareness of a problem can take many forms, but a need recognition is
essentially functional and realization may take place over time. So, in the case
of the purchase of an activity tracker, health problems due to lack of
exercise may occur due to many months of inactivity. Other
problems can be the result of routine depletion (e.g. petrol, food) or
unpredictability (e.g. the breakdown of a TV set or washing machine).
Consumer purchasing may be initiated by more emotional or psychological
needs, for example the purchase of Davidoff Cool Water cologne (Exhibit 4.2)
is likely to be motivated by status needs rather than any marginal functional
superiority over other fragrances.

The degree to which the consumer intends to resolve the problem depends
on two issues: the magnitude of the discrepancy between the desired and
present situation, and the relative importance of the problem (Neal et al. 2007).
A problem may be perceived, but if the difference between the current and
desired situation is small, the consumer may not be sufficiently motivated to
move to the next step in the decision-making process. For example, a person
considering upgrading their mobile phone from a basic handset to a
smartphone model will only make the purchase if they consider the difference
in benefits to be sufficient to incur the costs involved (even though they might
desire the more sophisticated product).
Conversely, a large discrepancy may be perceived, but the person may not
proceed to information search because the relative importance of the problem
is small. A person may feel the latest smartphone has significant advantages
over previous models but that the relative importance of the advantages
compared with other purchase needs (e.g. paying the mortgage or a holiday)
might be small.
The existence of a need may not however activate the decision-making
process in all cases. This is due to the existence of need inhibitors
(O’Shaughnessey 1987). For example, someone may want to buy an item on
Amazon Marketplace but may be inhibited by fear of paying online and not
receiving the goods. In such circumstances, the need remains passive.
There are a number of marketing implications in the need-recognition
stage:
The needs of consumers, and the problems they face: By being attuned to
customers’ needs, companies can create a competitive advantage. For
example, the marketing manager of a washing machine manufacturerpage 139
believes consumers value a silent machine, but marketing research designed
to assess customer problems (or needs) among washing machine users may
identify other sources of dissatisfaction and issues with current models.
Market research results can impact on product redesign. Samsung
Electronics found there was a need to be able to add clothing missed from a
load mid-cycle and developed the AddWash, with an additional door. It also
discovered young new home buyers have busy lives and want speed and
cleaning performance from their washing machines, so introduced the
innovative QuickDrive to meet this demand (Samsung 2018).
Need inhibitors that potentially stop a purchase: For example, global e￾commerce platform eBay Inc. recognized that overcoming the need
inhibitor ‘lack of trust in being sent the product’ as important. To overcome
this inhibitor, eBay introduced its PayPal payment system, which acts as
financial insurance against non-receipt of goods, and developed a feedback
system to allow buyers (and sellers) to post information on their transactions
and their experiences with vendors.
Need stimulation to encourage a purchase: Marketers’ activities, e.g.
developing advertising campaigns and training salespeople to sell product
benefits, may act as cues to needs arousal. For example, an advertisement
displaying the new features and benefits of a smartphone may stimulate
potential customers to reflect on the limitations of their current model, and
this evaluation can become a problem that warrants action if they regard
their phone to be lacking in some way.
Activating need/problem recognition depends on the size of the
discrepancy between the current and desired situation, and the relative
importance of the problem. An advertiser could therefore focus on the
advantages of a smartphone to create awareness of a larger discrepancy than
originally perceived and/or stress the importance of owning a top-of-the-range
model as a symbol of innovativeness and professionalism (thereby increasing
the importance of the purchase relative to other products).
Information search
If problem recognition is sufficiently strong, the consumer decision-making
process is likely to move to the second stage: information search. This involvesthe identification of alternative ways of problem solution. The search may be
internal or external. Internal search involves a review of relevant information
from memory. This review would include potential solutions, methods of
comparing solutions, reference to personal experiences and marketing
communications. If a satisfactory solution is not found, then external search
begins. This involves personal sources such as, say, friends and family, and/or
commercial sources such as advertisements, salespeople, websites and social
media.
Third-party reports, such as product-testing reports, may provide unbiased
information, and personal experiences may be sought, such as asking for
demonstrations, and viewing, touching or tasting the product.
The objective of information search is to build up the awareness set–that
is, the array of brands that may provide a solution to the problem. Using the
smartphone example again, an advertisement may not only stimulate a search
for more unbiased information regarding the advertised smartphone, but also
an external search for information about rival brands.
Information search by consumers is facilitated by the growth of internet
usage and firms that provide search facilities, such as Google, Bing, Yahoo!
and Baidu. Consumers are increasingly using the internet to gather information
before buying a product and reading reviews from other customers.
Evaluation of alternatives and the purchase
Step one in evaluation is to reduce the awareness set to a smaller set of brands
for serious consideration. Brands in the awareness set pass through a screening
filter to produce an evoked set–those brands the consumer seriously considers
before making a purchase. The evoked set is a shortlist of brands for careful
evaluation. The screening process may use different choice criteria from those
used when making the final choice, and the number of choice criteria used is
often fewer (Kuusela et al. 1998). One choice criterion used for screening may
be price, and products below a certain price point may form the evoked set.
Final choice may depend on price plus other choice criteria, such as, in the
case of a smartphone, ease of use, speed of connection to the internet and
reliability. The range of choice criteria used by consumers will be examined in
more detail later in this chapter.
Although brands may be perceived as similar, this does not necessarily
mean they will be equally preferred. This is because different productpage 140
attributes (e.g. benefits, imagery, status) may be used by people when making
similarity and preference judgements (Creusen and Schoormans 1997).
A key determinant of the extent to which consumers evaluate a brand is
their level of involvement. Involvement is the degree of perceived relevance
and personal importance affirming brand choice (Blackwell et al. 2005). When
a purchase is highly involving, the consumer is more likely to carry out
extensive evaluation. High-involvement purchases include those incurring high
expenditure or personal risk, such as buying a car or a home. In contrast, low￾involvement situations are characterized by simple evaluations about
purchases. Consumers use simple choice tactics to reduce time and effort
rather than maximize the consequences of the purchase (Elliott and Hamilton
1991). For example, when purchasing bread, milk or breakfast cereal,
consumers are likely to make quick choices rather than agonize over the
decision.
This distinction between high- and low-involvement situations implies
different evaluative processes. For high-involvement purchases, the Ajzen and
Fishbein theory of reasoned action (Ajzen and Fishbein 1980, 2005) provides a
robust starting point for understanding purchase behaviour in situations where
individuals are in complete control of the buying situation. But situations
where buyers have limits on their control, for example limits on their mental
and physical processing skills, emotions and compulsions, result in their
intentions to buy being moderated. So the degree to which individuals can
make a reasoned decision affects their intentional behaviour (Ajzen 1991).
This issue of control has led to an extension of the theory of reasoned action
model to include behavioural control (Ajzen and Madden 1985): the theory of
planned behaviour (TPB), which takes into account the degree of control
individuals have over their behavioural intentions (Ajzen 1985). Each of these
models will now be examined.
Theory of reasoned action–Ajzen and Fishbein model. This suggests that
an attitude towards a brand is based upon a set of beliefs about the brand’s
attributes (e.g. value for money, durability). These are the perceived
consequences resulting from buying the brand. Each attribute is weighted by
how good or bad the consumer believes the attribute to be. Those attributes
that are weighted highly will be that person’s choice criteria and will have a
large influence in the formation of attitude.Attitude is the degree to which someone likes or dislikes the brand overall.
The link between personal beliefs and attitudes is shown in Figure 4.3.
However, evaluation of a brand is not limited to personal beliefs about the
consequences of buying a brand. Outside influences also play a part.
Individuals will thus evaluate the extent to which important others believe that
they should or should not buy the brand. These beliefs may conflict with their
personal beliefs. People may think that buying a sports car may have positive
consequences (fun driving, being more attractive to other people) but refrain
from buying if they believe that important others (e.g. parents, boss) would
disapprove of the purchase. This collection of normative beliefs forms an
overall evaluation of the degree to which these outside influences approve or
disapprove of the purchase (subjective norms).
FIGURE 4.3
High involvement: theory of reasoned action–Ajzen and Fishbein model
The link between normative beliefs and subjective norms is also shown in
Figure 4.3. This is a theory of reasoned action. Consumers are highly involved
in the purchase to the extent that they evaluate the consequences of the
purchase and what others will think about it. Only after these considerations
have taken place are purchase intentions formed and a purchase results.
Purchase intentions are important, as they are a strong predictor of future
behaviour–an intention is an indication of an individual’s state of willingness
to carry out an action.
Theory of planned behaviour. While the theory of reasoned action provides
sound insight into how attitudes and beliefs shape intentions, it was found that
an individual’s behaviour is not completely controlled and rational. So the
theory of planned behaviour brings in the notion of control and suggests that
the extent to which individuals freely make decisions will shape their
intentions. In other words, our actual shopping behaviour, say of buyingpage 141
healthy foodstuffs, will be affected by our intention to buy healthy foodstuffs.
But, also, our intentions can be changed by external influences over which we
have limited control. So our healthy food purchase might be contingent on
time available to make the purchase, money and our skills of being able to
identify genuine healthy-option foodstuffs. Ajzen (1991, 2012) suggested
measuring perceived behavioural control, which is an individual’s belief as to
how easy or difficult it is to make an intended purchase, could reveal insight
into a person’s motivations. The control beliefs are the existence of factors that
might facilitate or impede a person’s behavioural intentions and ultimately
their purchase behaviour, for example social, cultural or religious factors (see
Figure 4.4). Therefore, if our healthy food buyer is a nutritionist
who can readily identify healthy options, they are likely to be
more in control and likely to make a purchase of healthy foodstuffs based on
scientific knowledge. A person who is less well informed about nutrition might
be more inclined to be influenced by, say, social factors and buy skimmed milk
based on presumptions about the milk, without specific knowledge of the
health benefits.
FIGURE 4.4
Models of attitudes, beliefs and intentions to purchase
Source: Ajzen and Fishbein (2005)
Ultimately, a person’s intention to perform a behaviour is a strong indicator
of whether they will carry out a certain act (e.g. buy healthy foodstuffs).However, obstacles can get in the way, for example demands from family and
work, which can limit the time available, and so a person buys a fast-food
ready meal, high in fat and sugar, instead of a healthier option.
Ehrenberg and Goodhardt model. In low-involvement situations
(Ehrenberg and Goodhardt 1980), the amount of information processing
implicit in the earlier model may not be worthwhile or sensible. A typical low￾involvement situation is the repeat purchase of fast-moving consumer goods
(FMCG). The work of Ehrenberg and Goodhardt suggests that a very simple
process may explain purchase behaviour (see Figure 4.5). According to this
model, awareness precedes trial, which, if satisfactory, leads to repeat
purchase. This behavioural model indicates that consumer behaviour becomes
habitual, with little conscious thought or formation of attitudes preceding the
purchase action. The notion of low involvement suggests that awareness
precedes behaviour and behaviour precedes attitude. In this situation, the
consumer does not actively seek information but is a passive recipient and the
consumer is likely to satisfice (i.e. search for a satisfactory solution rather than
the best one) (Wright 1974). Consequently, any of several brands that lie in the
evoked set may be considered adequate.
FIGURE 4.5
Low involvement: the Ehrenberg and Goodhardt repeat purchase model
Distinguishing between high-involvement and low-involvement situations
is very important because how consumers evaluate products and brands leads
to contrasting marketing implications. In the high-involvement situation,
marketing managers should provide a good deal of information about the
positive consequences of buying as the consumer is making a significant
decision. Messages with high information content should enhance knowledge
about the brand, but high levels of repetition are not needed (Rothschild 1978).
Print and digital media used in the high-involvement case can allow detailed
and repeated scrutiny of information. Car advertisements often provide
detailed information about the comfort, reliability and performance of the
model, and they appeal to status considerations as all of these appeals maypage 142
influence the consumer’s beliefs about the consequences of buying the model.
A sales force also has an important role to play in the high-involvement
situation by ensuring that the customer is aware of the important attributes of
the product and correctly evaluates their consequences, and providing
opportunities for customers to ask questions.
For low-involvement situations, the evaluation of alternatives is much
more rudimentary and attitude change is likely to follow purchase. Attempting
to gain top-of-mind awareness through advertising and providing positive
reinforcement (e.g. through sales promotion) to gain trial may be more
important than providing masses of information about the consequences of
buying the brand. Furthermore, as this is of little interest, the consumer is not
actively seeking information but is a passive receiver. Consequently,
advertising messages should be short, with a small number of key points, but
with high repetition to enhance learning (Rothschild 1978). It is important to
be aware that, while these ideas are still valid, digital marketing and the greater
use of online channels for communicating have changed the format of
communication messages and the way they are received. These issues are
considered in detail in Chapters 13, 14 and 15.
Marketers must be aware of the role of emotion in consumer evaluation of
alternatives. A major source of high emotion is when a product is high in
symbolic meaning. Consumers believe products help to construct and maintain
their self-concept and sense of identity. Furthermore, ownership of the product
will help communicate the desired image to other people. In such cases, non￾rational preferences may inform an information search. Instead, consumers
consult their feelings for information about a decision: ‘How do I feel about
it?’ Consequently, many marketers attempt to create a feeling of warmth about
their brands. The mere exposure to a brand name over time, and the use of
humour in advertisements, can create such feelings.
Impulse buying is another area that can be associated with emotions.
Consumers have described a compelling feeling that is ‘thrilling’, ‘wild’, ‘a
tingling sensation’, ‘a surge of energy’ and ‘like turning up the volume’ (Rook
1987; Elliott 1998) (see Marketing in Action 4.1).MARKETING IN ACTION 4.1
Impulsive Behaviour, Panic Buying and WeChat Mini
Programs
Different influences can stimulate emotionally charged purchasing, as described in the
examples that follow.
Panic buying
Impulse purchasing and panic buying are characterized by highly charged emotions, limited
cognitive control and reactive rather than planned behaviour. External factors appear to
increase in importance in the consumer decision-making process and encourage shoppers
to engage in frenzied bouts of buying. In 2020, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic,
shoppers rushed to stock up on pasta, toilet rolls, laundry liquid, cleaning products and
many other commodities, brought about by fear and uncertainty. Social commerce also
adds to the hype and challenges faced by more traditional marketing communication tools
and messaging.

Expat British consumers living in the US reacted aggressively towards legal action taken by
American food producer Hershey’s to stop the sale of Cadbury chocolate bars due to an
infringement of its trademark. Chocolate lovers started to buy up stocks of their favourite
confectionery, and warehouses emptied quickly as panic about the future lack of availability
of their beloved English-made chocolate bars increased.
The source of the argument was that Cadbury entered global markets through Mondelez
International; together their chocolate accounts for nearly a third of all that consumed in the
UK, but when it comes to North America, Hershey’s produces Dairy Milk under licence for
the Cadbury brand, using a slightly different recipe. Cadbury has a long and illustrious
history, and chocolate with a distinctive taste to match; expat consumers were so attached
to the Cadbury brand that emotions ran high and the threat of scarcity drove demand.
Impulse purchasingpage 143
Black Friday was introduced to online shoppers in the UK by Amazon in 2010. By 2014, it
had hit critical mass and promotions moved to the physical high street too. Asda/Walmart
ran flash promotions in its stores, which created chaos as consumers literally fought over
LED TVs, electric drills and tablet computers at heavily discounted prices. This event
continues to grow in the UK, and has extended to service industries as airlines and hotels
jump on the discount bandwagon.
Originally, Black Friday was the Philadelphia police force’s answer to the chaos that ensued
in the 1950s and 1960s after Thanksgiving (celebrated in the US on the fourth Thursday in
November). The name came out of the effects of the frenzied shopping on the city’s
retailers, as they reportedly saw profits move out of the red and into the black. Whether true
or not, Black Friday represented a kick-start for Christmas shoppers, which seems set to
continue, but marketers should be aware that online shoppers are savvy bargain hunters
and will not be motivated to purchase if products can be found cheaper elsewhere and at
other times of the year.
Luxury impulse purchasing
According to Rao and Ko (2021), Chinese luxury goods shoppers prone to impulsive
purchasing are predominantly female, single and young, with high levels of brand
awareness, whereas male shoppers are more likely to be loyal to their brands. This study
also discovered WeChat Mini Program, which is an app within an app that combines social
media and e-commerce and can be used in many ways by many industries. WeChat is a
powerful social media marketing tool in China and attracts significant percentages of
marketing spend. Luxury brands have been using these programs as an alternative sales
channel to widen customer engagement. Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Tiffany, Burberry and
Cartier are examples of luxury brands using WeChat to inform and educate shoppers. Louis
Vuitton offers limited-edition goods through pop-up shops to stimulate excitement and
impulse shopping. By changing marketing focus and targeting different consumer groups,
marketers can improve the performance of digital channels, especially mobile and social
media.

Post-purchase evaluation of the decision
Effective marketing aims to create customer satisfaction in both high- and
low-involvement situations. Marketing managers want to create positive
experiences from the purchase of their products or services. Nevertheless, it is
common for customers to experience some post-purchase concerns; this is
called cognitive dissonance. Dissonance is likely to increase in four ways–
with the expense of purchase; when the decision is difficult (e.g. many
alternatives, many choice criteria and each alternative offering benefits not
available with the others); when the decision is irrevocable; and when the
purchaser has a tendency to experience anxiety (Neal et al. 2007)–and is oftenpage 144
associated with high-involvement purchases. Post-purchase, a car buyer may
attempt to reduce dissonance by looking at advertisements, websites and
brochures for their model, and seeking reassurance from owners of the same
model. Volkswagen buyers are more likely to look at Volkswagen
advertisements and avoid Renault or Ford advertisements. Car dealers can
build relationships to reduce buyer remorse by contacting recent purchasers to
reinforce the wisdom of their decision and confirm the quality of their after￾sales service.
What are the choice criteria?
Choice criteria are the various attributes (and benefits) a consumer uses when
evaluating products and services. They provide the grounds for deciding to
purchase one brand or another. Different members of the buying centre may
use different choice criteria. For example, a child may use the criterion of self￾image when choosing shoes, whereas a parent may use price. Choice criteria
can change over time due to changes in income through the family lifecycle.
As disposable income rises, so price may no longer be the key criterion but is
replaced by considerations of status or social belonging.
Table 4.1 lists four types of choice criteria and gives examples of each:
1. Technical criteria are related to the performance of the product or service,
and include reliability, durability, comfort and convenience. Convenience is
often synonymous with ease of use.
2. Economic criteria concern the cost aspects of purchase, and include price,
running costs and residual values (e.g. the trade-in value of a car).
3. Social criteria concern the impact that the purchase makes on the person’s
perceived relationships with other people, and the influence of social norms
on the person. The purchase of a BMW car may be based on status
considerations as much as on any technical advantages over its rivals. Social
norms such as convention and fashion can also be important choice criteria,
with some brands being rejected as too unconventional, although some
advertisers do playfully use unconventional ideas to get their brands noticed.
4. Personal criteria are to do with how the product or service relates to the
individual psychologically. Self-image is our personal view of ourselves.
Some people might view themselves as ‘cool’ and successful, and buy
sportswear items only from Under Armour, Adidas or Nike to reflect
perceptions of themselves. Risk reduction can affect choicedecisions, since some people are risk averse and prefer to choose ‘safe’
brands; an example is the purchase of designer labels, which reduces the
risk of being seen wearing unfashionable clothing. Ethical criteria can be
important and brands may be rejected because they are manufactured by
companies that have offended a person’s ethical code of behaviour.

EthicsEmotions
Research has shown consumers consider ethical criteria, and a large
majority enjoy buying products from companies giving something back to
society (Confino and Muminova 2011). The market for ethical products has
grown in recent years. Some of the products deemed ethical include fairly
traded foods and drinks that guarantee a fair deal to producers in developing
countries. A firm’s green credentials can be confusing, and can make it
difficult for consumers to choose the ‘best’ products because, although organic
may be seen as the greener, healthier food option, many scientific studies have
cast doubts on such conclusions. Although ethical consumption is important in
shaping and maintaining empowered ethical consumer identities and markets,
there is much uncertainty about the choices to be made, and, at times, ethical
trade-offs occur (e.g. products are not always organic as well as fair trade).
Although people feel empowered and responsible for environmental issues at
an individual level, this is coupled with the insecurity of not knowing what the
‘right choices’ are, and such contradictions pose huge challenges to policy￾makers and marketers alike. Marketing ethics and corporate social
responsibility are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.
Emotional criteria can be important in decision-making. Many purchase
decisions are experiential, and evoke feelings such as fun, pride or pleasure.
The importance of experiences to consumers has led to the growth in
experiential consumption. See Exhibit 4.3 to be taken on an adventure by the
Lurpak brand.

When a product scores well on a combination of choice criteria the
outcome can be global success. For example, the success of Apple’s iPhone
derives from the convenience of being able to access the internet and emails on
the move (technical), and the status (social) and high self-image (personal) that
is associated with owning one.
Marketing managers need to understand the choice criteria that are being
used by customers to evaluate their products and services. Such knowledge has
implications for priorities in product design (e.g. is style/look more important
than performance?) and the types of appeals to use in marketing
communications, which should be linked to the key choice criteria used by
buying centre members. Concern about store design and ambience at high￾street brands H&M and Zara reflects the importance of creating the right
experience when shopping for clothes.
Understanding consumer behaviour is important and it should be noted that
people are often not just passive receivers of a firm’s marketing efforts.
Cultural, gender and social status differences can have a profound effect on
behaviours (Jia et al. 2018). Furthermore, as discussed at the beginning of the
chapter, the contexts in which buying takes place are becoming more complex
and consumers are becoming participants in the creation of value (Tynan et al.
2010).
Where and when they buy
Broadly, consumers make purchases for different reasons: underlying
motivations and the importance of the purchase. Traditionally, the time andpage 145
place of purchase would be at a physical point of sale (e.g. at a store, outdoor
market or fair). This is no longer the case as the scope and opportunity of when
and where to buy has been significantly extended by e-commerce systems and
the growth of digital markets. More recently, mobile commerce has expanded
the opportunities to purchase even further via smartphones.
The ‘always on’ consumer
Through social media platforms, newsfeeds and digital interpersonal
communications, people constantly share knowledge and opinions (Ashman et
al. 2015), which can inform buying decisions. Food porn is a growing
phenomenon whereby images of food and eating experiences are
shared on social media platforms from Facebook and Instagram to
Pinterest. And the growing interest in food online has spread offline into
television programmes such as the popular Great British Bake Off (BBC 2010–
2022) (Lavis 2017). According to Ashman et al. (2015), the impact on
consumer behaviour is the forming of ‘hives’ of people sharing and constantly
exchanging ideas, which become resistant to firms’ advertising messaging (see
Exhibit 4.4). Critics suggest ‘hives’ form less individualistic ideas of ‘what’s
hot and what’s not’ but, more importantly, the ‘always on’ buzzing means
consumers are constantly interacting across different networks and
communication channels, which is very different to the sequential decision￾making process shown in Figure 4.2. Currently, where and when young
shoppers buy food, clothes, leisure and entertainment seems to only become
legitimized once it has been posted on social media, giving rise to the term
‘social shopping’ (Shen 2012). These issues are addressed from a digital
perspective in Chapters 14 and 15, and from a physical perspective in Chapter
16.
EXHIBIT 4.4

Compulsive consumption
Before moving on, it is worthwhile briefly considering a darker side to
consumer behaviour that relates to where and when we buy. Marketing in
Action 4.1 introduced impulsive purchases and considered how certain timed
promotional events can trigger excessive purchasing behaviour. Compulsive
consumption is the uncontrollable desire to engage in excessive and addictive
purchasing: hyperactive in-store and online purchasing (Chang et al. 2011) is
very different to impulse purchasing, which is spontaneous and unplanned
buying that remains in the buyer’s control. Compulsive shoppers tend to be
very well informed about store prices, promotional offers and sales events;
they make more purchases online and have higher credit card abuse than
shoppers who do not share the same compulsion to shop. This has implications
for marketers, who should be aware that compulsive buying can lead to
emotional and financial difficulties, and these types of shoppers should be
discouraged from spending (Darrat et al. 2016).
Influences on Consumer Behaviour
Our discussion of the evaluation of alternatives highlights that not all
consumer decisions follow the same decision-making process, involve the
same purchasers (buying centre) or use identical choice criteria; neither do
they occur at the same place or time. The consumer behaviour process, the
buying centre, choice criteria, purchase situation and timing can be influencedby many factors: the buying situation, personal influences, and social
influences (see Table 4.2).

The buying situation
Three types of buying situation can be identified: extended problem-solving,
limited problem-solving and habitual problem-solving.
Extended problem-solving
Extended problem-solving involves a high degree of information searching,
close examination of alternatives and the evaluation of many choice criteria
(Neal et al. 2007). Information search and evaluation may focus not only on
which brand/model to buy but also on where to make the purchase. The
potential for cognitive dissonance is greatest in this buying situation. Extended
problem-solving is usually associated with three conditions: the alternatives
are differentiated and numerous; there is an adequate amount of time availablepage 146
page 147
for deliberation; and the purchase has a high degree of involvement (Blackwell
et al. 2005).
Figure 4.6 summarizes these relationships. High involvement means the
purchase is personally relevant and seen as important with respect to basic
motivations and needs (Bettman 1982). Problem-solving is likely to be
extensive when all alternatives possess desirable features that others do not
have. If alternatives are perceived as being similar, then less time is required in
assessment. Extended problem-solving is inhibited by time pressure. If the
decision is made quickly, the extent of problem-solving activity is curtailed.
The decision-maker must also feel a high degree of involvement in the choice,
but how personally relevant and important the choice is to the decision-maker
varies from person to person. Original research by Laurent and Kapferer
(1985) identified four factors that affect involvement:
1. Self-image: involvement is likely to be high when the decision potentially
affects a person’s self-image. Thus, purchase of jewellery, cars and clothing
invokes more involvement than choosing a brand of soap or margarine.
2. Perceived risk: involvement is likely to be high when the perceived risk of
making a mistake is high. The risk of buying the wrong house is much
higher than of buying the wrong chewing gum because the potential
negative consequences of the wrong decision are higher. Risk usually
increases with the price of the purchase. Purplebricks, one of the UK’s
leading estate agents (see Exhibit 4.5), invested heavily in a multichannel
advertising campaign, ‘Let’s Get You Sold’, which emphasized the speed
and price of its online property sales service, encouraging both
buyers and sellers to use the online agency because it offers a
reliable, efficient and low-risk service (Lewis 2021).
3. Social factors: when social acceptance is dependent upon making a correct
choice, involvement is likely to be high. Buying of the right golf clubs may
be highly involved, as making a wrong decision may affect social standing
among fellow golfers; the principle may apply to clothes, trainers and other
products that can affect the purchaser’s acceptance within a social group.
4. Hedonism: when the purchase provides a high degree of pleasure,
involvement is usually high. The choice of restaurant when on holiday can
be highly involving, since the difference between making the right or wrongchoice can severely affect the amount of pleasure associated with the
experience.

Limited problem-solvingMany consumer purchases fall into the ‘limited problem-solving’ category. The
consumer has experience of the product, so an information search may be
mainly internal, through memory. However, a certain amount of external
search and evaluation may take place (e.g. checking prices) before purchasing.
This situation provides marketers with some opportunity to affect purchase by
stimulating the need to conduct search (e.g. advertising) and reducing the risk
of brand switching (e.g. warranties).
Habitual problem-solving
Habitual problem-solving occurs when a consumer repeat-buys the same
product with little or no evaluation of alternatives–for example, buying the
same breakfast cereal on a weekly shopping trip. The consumer may recall the
satisfaction gained by purchasing a brand and automatically buy it again.
Advertising may be effective in keeping the brand name in the consumer’s
mind and reinforcing already favourable attitudes.
Personal influences
There are six personal influences on consumer behaviour: information
processing, motivation, beliefs and attitudes, personality, lifestyle, and
lifecycle.
Information processing
Information processing refers to the process by which a stimulus is received,
interpreted, stored in memory and later retrieved (Blackwell et al. 2005),
highlighting the link between external influences, including marketing
activities, and the consumer’s decision-making process. Two key aspects of
information processing are perception and learning.
Perception is the complex process by which people select, organize and
interpret sensory stimulation into a meaningful picture of the world (Williams
1981). Three processes may be used to sort out the masses of stimuli that could
be perceived into a manageable amount: these are selective attention, selective
distortion and selective retention.
Selective attention is the process by which we screen out stimuli that are
neither meaningful nor consistent with our experiences and beliefs. On
entering a supermarket, there are thousands of potential stimuli (e.g. brands,page 148
point-of-sale displays, prices) to which we could pay attention. To do so would
be unrealistic in terms of time and effort. Consequently, we are selective in
attending to these messages. Selective attention has obvious implications for
advertising considering studies have shown that consumers consciously attend
to only 5–25 per cent of the advertisements to which they are exposed (Neal et
al. 2007).
Several factors influence attention. We pay more attention to stimuli that
contrast with their background than to stimuli that blend with it. Computer and
smartphone manufacturers have used the names of fruit to act as attention￾grabbing brand names (e.g. Apple, BlackBerry, Raspberry Pi) because they
contrast with the technologically orientated names usually
associated with computers. The size, colour and movement of a
stimulus also affect attention. Position is critical too, with objects placed near
the centre of the visual range more likely to be noticed than those on the
periphery. There is intense competition to obtain eye-level positions on
supermarket shelves. We are also more likely to notice those messages that
relate to our needs (benefits sought) and provide surprises (e.g. large price
reductions).
Selective distortion occurs when consumers distort the information they
receive according to their existing beliefs and attitudes. We may distort
information that is not in accord with our existing views. Methods of doing
this include thinking we misheard a message and discounting the message
source. Consequently, it is very important to present messages clearly, without
the possibility of ambiguity, and to use a highly credible source, which reduces
the scope for selective distortion of the message on the part of the recipient.
Distortion can occur because people interpret the same information differently.
Interpretation is a process whereby messages are placed into existing
categories of meaning. A cheaper price, for example, may be categorized not
only as providing better value for money but also as implying lower quality.
Information framing can affect interpretation. Framing refers to how
information is presented. The implications for marketing are that there is
benefit in framing communication messages in a positive manner. Words,
images, colours and even smell can influence interpretations. For example,
blue and green are viewed as cool, and evoke feelings of security. Red and
yellow are regarded as warm and cheerful. Black is seen as an indication of
strength. By using the appropriate colour in pack design it is possible to affect
the consumer’s feelings about the product. Marketers often base completebranding concepts on colour, for example Virgin Group uses red throughout its
branding. Smell can also influence interpretation.
Selective retention occurs when only a selection of messages are retained
in memory. We tend to remember messages that are in line with existing
beliefs and attitudes. Selective retention has a role to play in reducing
cognitive dissonance: when reading reviews of a recently purchased car,
positive messages are more likely to be remembered than negative ones.
Learning is any change in the content or organization of long-term
memory, and is the result of information processing (Neal et al. 2007). There
are numerous ways in which learning can take place. These include
conditioning and cognitive learning.
Classical conditioning is the process of using an established relationship
between a stimulus and response to cause the learning of the same response to
a different stimulus. Thus, in advertising, humour, which is known to elicit a
pleasurable response, may be used in the belief that these favourable feelings
will carry over to the product. Red Bull is a brand that benefits from such
associations. The humour in its advertising conveys a fun image, and the
promotion of Red Bull on the bodywork of racing cars projects a feeling of
excitement around the brand by association (see Exhibit 4.6).
EXHIBIT 4.6

Operant conditioning differs from classical conditioning by way of the
role and timing of the reinforcement. In this case, reinforcement results from
reward: the more rewarding the response, the stronger the likelihood of the
purchase being repeated. Operant conditioning occurs because of product trial.page 149
The use of free samples is based on the principles of operant conditioning.
Free samples of a new shampoo may be distributed to a large number of
households so the shampoo can be used (desired response) without making an
initial purchase. Procter & Gamble introduced its Olay Body Wash using this
tactic. The rewards for the consumer are the benefits experienced at no cost.
These experiences then reinforce the likelihood of the consumer making a
paid-for purchase. Thus, the sequence of events is different between classical
and operant conditioning. In classic conditioning, liking precedes trial,
whereas in operant conditioning, trial precedes liking.
For marketers, introducing a series of rewards (reinforcements) may
encourage repeat buying of a product. A free sample may be accompanied by a
coupon to buy the product at a discounted rate (reinforcement). Another
discount coupon may be on the pack to encourage repeat buying. After this
purchase, the product relies on its own intrinsic reward–product
performance–to encourage purchase. This process is known as
shaping. Repeat purchase behaviour will have been shaped by the application
of repeated reinforcers so that the consumer will have learned that buying the
product is associated with pleasurable experiences.
Cognitive learning involves the learning of knowledge, and development
of beliefs and attitudes without direct reinforcement.
Rote learning involves the learning of two or more concepts without
conditioning. Zoflora, the popular household disinfectant, ‘cuts through grease
and grime and kills germs beautifully’ (Zoflora 2022), according to its
advertising, and this encourages us to learn about the product without the kinds
of conditioning and reinforcement previously discussed.
Vicarious learning involves learning from others without direct
experience or reward. It is the promise of the reward that motivates. Thus, we
may learn the type of clothes that attract potential admirers by observing other
people. In advertising, the ‘admiring glance’ can be used to signal approval of
the type of clothing being worn. We imagine that the same may happen to us if
we dress in a similar way.
Reasoning is a more complex form of cognitive learning and is usually
associated with high-involvement situations. For example, some advertising
messages rely on the recipient drawing their own conclusions through
reasoning.
Whichever type of learning has taken place the result of the learning
process is the creation of product positioning. The market objective is to createa clear and favourable position in the mind of the consumer (Ries and Trout
2001).
The ways in which consumers process information are highly complex,
and while extensive research has been done in this field, the use of technology
is creating opportunities for marketers to learn so much more about how
consumers behave–and on a real-time basis. Online tracking mechanisms such
as supercookies, browser fingerprinting and behavioural tracking provide
detailed information about what happens online. A customer visits a seller’s
website, and the retailer has information about age, gender and physical
location, and an estimation of income, without any input from the customer
(O’Rourke 2014). This monitoring of behaviour does not end online. Tracking
through mobile phones means customers can be pinpointed within a few feet,
while eye-tracking applications even enable marketers to know what we are
looking at. Another technological technique that holds great potential for
understanding how consumers process information is neuroscience, as
Marketing in Action 4.2 discusses.

Technology Delivers Consumer Insights: The Age of
Neuromarketing

Which image would you choose to sell milk?
According to one of the world’s leading neuromarketing experts, Dr A.K. Pradeep, when
consumers are asked to choose, ‘the one that always wins out is the cow’. He suggests the
underlying reasoning is that the source of a product hits a spot deep in the subconsciouspage 150
that is more evocative than any of the other associated images. Pradeep says that
neuroscience allows marketers to find out what a brand means in the subconscious mind.
One brand he feels understands how to ‘market to the buying brain’ is Jo Malone. This
perfume brand uses images of ingredients to trigger positive emotions, which he advocates
are far more powerful than images of a man and woman in a passionate embrace
(McCormick 2011).
Pradeep is not the only advocate for using technology to understand consumer behaviour.
Professor Dara O’Rourke (2014) has also made a stand, and his advice to marketers
looking to determine insights into consumer behaviour is to ‘ditch simplistic surveys’ and use
instead behavioural tracking and neuroscience. Increasingly, technology is providing
insights into consumer behaviour using eye-tracking and electroencephalogram (EEG)
tests, which involve measuring brain signals. For marketers, the key question is how
consumers process information, as this sheds light on how they make purchasing choices,
for example what clothes we buy or what music we like to listen to. Potentially,
neuroscience and the study of the brain and nervous system by means of functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning and EEG tests have all the answers. The
brain is made up of networks of neurons. When these cell clusters are stimulated, they use
more energy. These active areas light up on fMRI scans, allowing researchers to map
emotion and cognition. The scanner produces a colour-coded image of the brain that is
helpful in revealing a person’s unconscious feelings about a brand, an advertisement or
even a media channel. For example, an understanding of the effects of different media
channels (e.g. print versus the internet) on brain stimulation has been found to be useful
when making media decisions.
This application of the techniques of neuroscience to marketing is called neuromarketing.
Neuromarketing advocates like O’Rourke and Pradeep argue it is an objective tool that
scientifically demonstrates and quantifies human reactions, and provides new insights into
how people process information. Despite sceptics’ view that neuromarketing has not
revealed huge insights into human behaviour that aren’t already instinctively known, much
research continues to explore brain responses. Facial expression and eye movement
analysis, brain activity and neuroimaging, plus heart rate monitoring are some of the tools
being used to help marketers gain deeper insights into human brain activity. More
specifically, neuromarketing seeks to provide insights into the effects of marketing stimuli
and to help reveal more about perceptual learning motivation and emotions. If successful,
neuromarketing could deepen our understanding of how consumers react to many different
forms of advertising, both subconsciously and in real time.

(2018); Sung et al. (2020)
Motivation
An understanding of motivation lies in the relationship between needs, drives
and goals (Luthans 2001). The basic process involves needs (deprivations) that
set drives in motion (deprivations with direction) to accomplish goals
(anything that alleviates a need and reduces a drive). Maslow’s hierarchy ofpage 151
needs model has been widely used in management education, but you should
be aware that it was devised in the mid-twentieth century and centred on
American society, where individualism was very important, especially to the
middle classes (Bennett 2011). Arguably, it is rather one-dimensional, as the
model does not accommodate the influence of others–for example family,
children, work colleagues, society–on an individual’s motivation. According to
Pinder (1998), ‘Motivation is a force that prompts action and relates to
conscious or unconscious decision involving how, when, and why to allocate
effort to a task or activity’ (Eysenck and Eysenck 1985). The question of why
people buy is complex; the discussion of choice criteria links to motivation and
can explain why one consumer may choose a Honda car because they are price
conscious while another may choose a Mercedes because they are status
conscious. The influence of personality may explain the motivations that
underpin why an extrovert may choose a red sports car while an introvert may
prefer a grey Skoda.
Please note that levels of motivation vary depending on the individual, the
type of purchase and the purchase occasion. The motivations for buying luxury
goods focus on motives such as the desire to portray a specific social class,
communicate a desired self-image and provide self-concept reinforcement–
visible proof the consumer can afford higher-priced products (Nwankwo et al.
2014). It is important to understand the motives driving consumers as motives
can determine choice criteria and subsequently enable marketers to get closer
to their customers.
Beliefs and attitudes
A belief is a thought that a person holds about something. In a marketing
context, it is a thought about a product or service on one or more choice
criteria. Beliefs about a Volvo car might be that it is safe, reliable and high
status. Marketing people are very interested in consumer beliefs because these
are related to attitudes. Misconceptions about products can be harmful to brand
sales. Duracell batteries were believed by consumers to last three times as long
as Eveready batteries, but in continuous use they in fact lasted more than six
times as long. This prompted Duracell to launch an advertising
campaign to correct this misconception. Unilever’s savoury breakfast
spread Marmite recognizes the beliefs of some consumers will be favourable
towards the brand and others negative. An ad for Marmite-flavoured peanut
butter that appeared on Facebook, depicting an animated peanut-lovingsquirrel, emphasized positive feelings and was very successful at raising
awareness of the brand, scoring highly on attention-grabbing and likeability.
By presenting the brand in this way, the advertisement invited consumers to try
the Marmite-flavoured peanut butter, to find out whether they would love it too
(Jefferson 2022).
An attitude is an overall favourable or unfavourable evaluation of a
product or service. The consequence of a set of beliefs may be a positive or
negative attitude towards the product or service. Beliefs and attitudes play an
important part in the evaluation of alternatives in the consumer decision￾making process. They may be developed as part of the information search
activity and/or as a result of product use, and they play an important role in
product design (matching product attributes to beliefs and attitudes), in
persuasive communications (reinforcing existing positive beliefs and attitudes,
correcting misconceptions and establishing new beliefs, e.g. ‘Skoda is a
quality car brand’) and in pricing (matching price with customers’ beliefs
about what a ‘good’ product would cost).
Personality
Our everyday dealings with people tell us that they differ enormously in their
personalities. Personality is the inner psychological characteristics of
individuals that lead to consistent responses to their environment. A person
may tend to be warm–cold, dominant–subservient, introvert–extrovert,
sociable–loner, adaptable–inflexible, competitive–cooperative, etc. If
marketing research reveals our product is purchased by people with a certain
personality profile, then advertising could show people of the same type using
the product. Brand personality is a brand’s characterization as perceived by
consumers. Brands may be characterized as ‘for the sophisticated’ (Apple,
Rolex, Gucci), ‘for winners’ (Nike) or ‘for excitement’ (Tesla, Red Bull). This
is a dimension over and above the physical (e.g. colour) or functional (e.g.
taste) attributes of a brand. By creating a brand personality, a marketer may
create appeal to people who value that characterization.
Economic circumstances
During periods of economic growth, consumer spending is fuelled by rising
income levels and confidence in job security. Products that are the subject of
discretionary spending, such as luxury brands, expensive holidays, restaurantpage 152
meals and top-of-the-range consumer durables, thrive. However, changing
economic circumstances–such as recession, deflation, inflation and fears about
employment prospects–drive many consumers to postpone purchases, become
more price-sensitive and change their shopping habits. Economic
circumstances, therefore, can have a major effect on consumer behaviour. The
2020s began with uncertainty as a result of the global pandemic, economic
pressures from rising inflation, the cost of living crisis and political instability
in Europe. According to Hamill (2022), these macroenvironmental forces
caused marketers to reconsider their use of the Four-Ps to stay close to their
customers: recommending pricing must appear fair, products should offer
value, promotion should be responsive, and place must be digital and well as
physical.
Lifestyle
Lifestyle refers to the pattern of living as expressed in a person’s activities,
interests and opinions. Lifestyle analysis (psychographics) groups consumers
according to their beliefs, activities, values and demographic characteristics,
such as education and income. Lifestyle analysis has implications for
marketing since lifestyles have been found to correlate with purchasing
behaviour (O’Brien and Ford 1988). A firm may target a particular lifestyle
group (e.g. succeeders) with a product offering, and use communications that
reflect the values and beliefs of this group. An example of how changing
lifestyles affect consumer behaviour is the popularity of on-the-go products
with people who live very busy lives. On-the-go drinks, such as bottled water
and takeaway coffee, and on-the-go food, such as cereal-based breakfast snack
bars, are popular among time-pressured consumers.
Lifecycle and age
Consumer behaviour might depend on the stages reached during their lives. A
person’s lifecycle stage (shown in Figure 4.7) is relevant since disposable
income and purchase requirements may vary according to stage. For
example, young couples with no children may have high disposable
income if both work, and they may be heavy purchasers of home furnishings
and appliances since they may be setting up home. When they have children,
disposable income may fall, particularly if they become a single-income
family, and the purchase of baby- and child-related products increases. At the
empty-nester stage, disposable income may rise due to the absence ofdependent children, low mortgage repayments and high personal income. This
type of person may be a high-potential target for financial services and
holidays.
FIGURE 4.7
Lifecycle stages
However, not all people follow the classic family lifecycle stages. Figure
4.7 also shows alternative paths that may have consumer behaviour and market
segmentation implications.
Age is an effective discriminator of consumer behaviour. For example,
young people have different tastes in product categories such as clothing,
drinks, holidays and television viewing compared to older people. The young
have always been a prime target for marketers because of their capacity to
spend.
Social influences
There are four social influences on consumer behaviour: culture, social class,
geodemographics and reference groups.Culture refers to the traditions, taboos, values and basic attitudes of the
whole society within which an individual lives. It provides the framework
within which individuals and their lifestyles develop. Cultural norms are the
rules that govern behaviour, and are based upon values–that is, beliefs about
what attitudes and behaviours are desirable. Conformity to norms is created by
reward-giving (e.g. smiling) and sanctioning (e.g. criticism). Cultural values
affect how business is conducted and also affect consumption behaviour.
Social class is an important determinant of consumer behaviour. In the UK
it is largely based on occupation. Advertising media (e.g. newspapers) usually
give readership/viewership figures broken down by social class groupings.
Every country has its own method of grouping and, in the UK, the National
Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) system identifies eight
categories based on occupation (see Table 4.3). Social class is a predictive
measure of consumption, although consumption patterns are likely to vary
within each of the groups (e.g. some people may be more inclined to spend
their money on consumer durables, while others may have more hedonistic
preferences). It is important to note that the influence of social class should be
tempered by lifecycle, lifestyle and age.

Another method of classifying households is based on geographic location.
This analysis–called geodemographics–is based on population census data.
Households are grouped into geographic clusters based on information such as
type of accommodation, car ownership, age, occupation, number and age of
children, and ethnicity, which can be used for market segmentation and
positioning. This topic is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.
Geodemographics is an effective method of segmenting many markets.
Reference groups indicate a group of people that influences an
individual’s attitude or behaviour. Where a product is conspicuous–for
example, clothing or cars–the brand or model chosen may have been strongly
influenced by perceptions of what is acceptable to the reference group. This
group may consist of family members, a group of friends or work colleagues.
Reference groups influence their members by the roles and norms expected of
them. For example, students may have to play several roles: to lecturers, the
role of learner; to other students, the role may vary from peer to social
companion. Depending on the adopted role, behaviours and purchasing
patterns may vary based upon group norms.
There are two main types of reference group: membership and aspirant
groups. Membership groups are the groups to which a person already belongs.
What is believed to be suitable, acceptable and/or impressive to this group may
play a major role in consumption behaviour. What other people think at a
party, at work or generally socializing is of great importance. Aspirant groups
are the groups to which the individual would like to belong. Stereotypically,
men supposedly want to look/feel like their favourite sports stars and women
want to look/feel like famous film stars or models. This motivates the purchase
of football shirts with ‘Ronaldo’ on the back, and the buying of clothing seen
to be worn by Adele or Kate Moss. ASOS, the online fashion retailer, bases its
marketing strategy on aspirant group theory. It copies the style of clothing
worn by film stars and models, and sells its clothes to aspirant women who
wish to dress like them. Celebrities such as David Beckham, Ronaldo, Katepage 154
Moss and Angelina Jolie also act as opinion leaders to aspirant group
members, influencing their consumption behaviour.
Business-to-Business Customers
Business-to-business (B2B) markets are an important part of modern
marketing; networks of suppliers provide goods and services to firms of all
sizes throughout global economies. In this section we explore what B2B
marketing is and why it is important, the people and processes in purchasing,
influences on buying decisions and B2B market segments.
What is B2B marketing?
B2B marketing is the practice of selling products and services between
organizations and includes the people and processes involved in organizational
buying. These types of markets account for nearly half of all revenues in
developed countries.
Broadly, there are three types of B2B market:
1. Industrial markets consist of producers that buy products and services to
help them manufacture other goods and services. Industrial goods include
raw materials, components, and capital goods such as machinery, as well as
many leading consumer brands, which use exclusive distribution channels
to sell their goods.
2. Reseller markets comprise companies that buy products and services to
resell. Retailers, mail-order companies and online retailers are examples of
resellers.
3. Government and institutional markets consist of government agencies and
organizations that buy products and services to help them carry out their
activities, for example local authorities, the police, schools, hospitals.
Trading in B2B markets can be complex, involving significant purchasing
decisions, include many people in buying decisions, follow formalized
procedures and operate on a global scale. B2B markets are different frombusiness-to-consumer (B2C) markets as they serve demand that is driven by
firms (intermediaries) across the value chain, and operate in a culture driven
by manufacturing and technology, as opposed to B2C markets, which serve
demand at the end of the value chain and operate in a marketing culture
(Grewal and Lilien 2012).
B2B marketing is shaped by many factors, as discussed below.
Nature and size of customers
Typically, the number of customers in B2B markets is smaller than in
consumer markets. The Pareto rule often applies, with 80 per cent of output
being sold to 20 per cent of customers. It is important to understand there are
different sizes of businesses within B2B markets too, which operate on a local,
regional, national or global scale. Read Marketing in Action 4.3 to discover
more about the marketing, buying and selling of cheese.
MARKETING IN ACTION 4.3
Quel Fromage? You Can’t Be Serious!
France is one of the world’s largest cheese producers within the dairy industry; it is
important economically and has a strong export market, with 36 per cent of production sold
within Europe, where Europeans consume large amounts of cheese every year. The home
market is strong too: individually, French people, on average, consume more cheese than
people in the US, UK, Spain, Norway and the Netherlands.
Source: Roger Utting/Shutterstockpage 155
Nature and size of the market
There are many types of firms in this industry, which vary considerably in size from the
typical French farm, which is small, with around 50 cows, and probably sells its milk through
cooperatives to large dairy groups such as Lactalis, the largest dairy group in the world,
which owns industrial manufacturing plants in 44 different countries.
There are many businesses of different sizes and functions producing different products,
which vary in price depending on whether they are industrially produced or made by craft
manufacturers of artisan cheese, using milk from cows, sheep or goats. The
total cheese output of all businesses in the French cheese industry is
approaching two million tons per annum, with Brie, Camembert and Comté being among
the most popular.
Intensity of competition is tempered by a strong sense of partnership, collaboration and
cooperation. From farm to factory, relationships are key in cheese production. Dairy
cooperatives have been around a very long time and have helped to transform cheese
production in France, where they work in collaboration with, and are run in the interests of,
the people. France has more than 60,000 farms producing milk from cows, sheep and
goats, which sell their produce through 260 cooperatives (54 per cent) or private producers
(46 per cent). More than 70 per cent of this milk is made into dairy products by around 650
processing units, which manufacture 1,000-plus varieties of cheese. The industry is
governed by partnership organizations, which manage the stewardship of the countryside,
environment and heritage of the industry.
Importance of large customers
Lactalis, with an annual turnover of €20 billion, is a major customer for many businesses on
the production side and a major seller of cheese in the global cheese industry. The group
owns many well-known brands of cheese: the Président brand (French, sold in over 140
countries, earning €1.8 billion), Galbani (Italian, sold in 130 countries, earning €1.5 billion)
and Seriously (made by McLelland in Scotland). Seriously is a fully owned subsidiary of
Lactalis; the product is manufactured in Stranraer, Scotland, and the brand is positioned in
the market as a heritage Cheddar, with distinct character, from unspoiled rural Scotland. For
Lactalis, all its brands need to perform well, so when Seriously Strong started to fall into
decline the group invested in a brand refresh, so that it could compete with other cheese
brands popular in the UK, Cathedral Cheddar and Philadelphia. The rebranding involved
changing the name slightly from Seriously Strong to Seriously, new packaging and TV
commercials. The £5 million investment in the brand refresh sought to reposition and help
sell the cheeses to retail resellers. Following the makeover, Lactalis McLelland was able to
negotiate a deal with the Co-operative retail group so that the cheese would feature in its
extensive network of convenience stores and, in doing so, would increase sales.
Investments in marketing continue for this brand; Seriously Spreadable, a product
extension, also ran a £1 million campaign making it the fastest-growing product in the
spreadable cheese market. So, the next time you fancy a nibble of cheese, think about the
complex global network of farmers, producers, buyers and suppliers that have been working
together to bring your choice of cheese to the table.

Lactalis (2022); Seriously (2022)
The intensity of the competition and the number of players in a market
depends on how goods are manufactured and what is being sold. In thepage 156
computer component manufacturing industry a small number of dominant
global players represent a large share of the market, e.g. Apple, Microsoft,
IBM, Hewlett Packard, Intel and Cisco Systems. The importance of smaller
numbers of large customers (compared with B2C markets, fewer suppliers
serve large numbers of individual customers) is that this influences marketing
behaviour. In B2B markets, suppliers (sellers) develop longer-term
relationships with their buyers and invest heavily in developing collaborative
relationships. Dedicated sales and marketing teams under the title of ‘key
account management’ (KAM) are employed to service large accounts. (See
Chapter 5 for detailed discussion of relationship marketing and Chapter 15 for
professional selling and sales management.) Each B2B market is unique and
types of products, manufacturing processes and methods of distribution affect
the nature and size of customers.
Complexity of buying
B2B purchasing involves investment and many people at different levels of the
organization. Increasingly, buying has become more complex and buyers are
under pressure to make cost savings, while improving the quality, flexibility
and speed of delivery of the purchasing investment (Bals et al. 2018). Due to
this complexity, relationships are very important and play an important role in
the buying process. Co-creation activities between buyers and sellers
increasingly aim to bring added value for all parties (Chang et al. 2018).
Economic and technical choice criteria
Although B2B buyers are affected by emotional factors such as liking or
disliking a salesperson, B2B buying decisions are made on economic and
technical criteria, as buyers must justify their decisions to their organization
(Jobber and Lancaster 2019). Also, the formalization of the buying function
through the establishment of purchasing departments leads to the use of
economic rather than emotional choice criteria. Purchasing is
becoming a skilled and professional activity, using sophisticated
economic criteria, with techniques such as lifecycle cost, total cost of
ownership and value-in-use analysis. Fleet buyers, for example, calculate
lifecycle costs, including purchase price and running and maintenance costs,
when considering which car to buy.Network technology and e-commerce
B2B markets use technology in purchasing, which ensures fast, efficient
processing of orders, reduction of costs, fewer people are involved in decision￾making, and transactions are accurate and auditable. E-commerce and
procurement systems have shifted purchasing from the physical marketplace to
the virtual ‘marketspace’, enabling seamless real-time purchasing, and have
improved the ability of companies to source products and services globally.
Value-added networks deliver benefits such as reduced procurement costs, fast
supply, greater agility to respond to the changing marketing environment,
better connectivity with suppliers, greater reach, increased opportunities to
trade globally, and closer working relationships between suppliers and
customers. Online marketplaces give access to purchasing ecosystems, which
facilitate greater communication within and across industries and to the end
consumer. Alibaba.com is the world’s leading trading platform (see Exhibit
4.7). The marketplace connects buyers and suppliers from China and around
the world. Its web presence includes an international marketplace
(www.alibaba.com) that focuses on global importers and exporters, and a
China marketplace (www.alibaba.com.cn) that focuses on suppliers and buyers
trading domestically in China, and adding a mobile site has increased trading
interactions fourfold (Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick 2022). Digital technology is
blurring the lines between B2B and B2C, as purchasing systems are integrated
with marketing channels. For example, as the world’s largest retailer, Walmart
needs to compete with Amazon and so is investing in its supply chain
fulfilment and omnichannel strategy to support its growing e-commerce
operation (Banker 2021). Suppliers like Procter & Gamble have developed
automated reordering systems linking retail shelves in Walmart with inventory
management systems using satellite communication systems (Lu 2018).

Risk and uncertainty
Risk and uncertainty affect buying in B2B markets and influence the structure
of the buying centre. The greater the uncertainty, the higher the risk, and the
more people are likely to be involved in the buying decision, whereas when
uncertainty is low, risks are lower, and purchases can be highly formalized and
monitored by strict rules (Juha and Pentti 2008), and orders are more likely to
be transacted using automated purchasing and replenishment systems.
B2B markets are contractual and terms are often agreed before the product
is made due to the size of investment required. Products can be highly
technical, and the seller may be faced with unforeseen problems once work has
started, which can mean that the buyer incurs unplanned losses. Here are some
of the different types of risk a professional buying team should consider:
Trade wars, which can lead to import tariffs. For example, the US
motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson reduced production in Europe
due to EU tariffs (Donnan et al. 2018). However, in 2022, the UK and US
brokered a deal to remove tariffs on British steel, reducing tariffs on
American goods like Harley-Davidson, Levi’s jeans and Bourbon whiskey
(Jolly 2022).
Raw material shortages: While manufacturers and organizations try to
purchase more locally, production supply chains of raw materials tend to be
global. A global shortage of semiconductor chips forced car manufacturer
Toyota to cut production in Japan, while Ford, General Motors and Jaguar
Land Rover sent home their workforces as their cars use many types of
these chips in high-tech devices that link cars to data centres and
smartphones plus much more (Economist 2021).page 157
Product recalls and safety scares: Both suppliers and buyers must be
compliant when purchasing and must react swiftly when things go wrong.
The fitness tracker Fitbit had to recall 1.7 million of its smart watches
because of a problem with their batteries, which were overheating and
burning some users (Partridge 2022).
Climate change and environmental regulations are increasingly
having an impact on global supply chains. Flooding and water
shortages are affecting production and logistics. Stricter controls on
pollution, waste and use of raw materials are also causing changes such as
production plant closures and the discontinuation of some products (Kamal
and Larsson 2019).
Buying to specific requirements
Because of the large sums of money involved, B2B buyers sometimes draw up
product specifications and ask suppliers to design specific products. Services,
too, are often conducted to specific customer requirements, marketing research
and advertising services being examples. This is much less a feature of
consumer marketing, where a product offering may be developed to meet a
need of a market segment but, beyond that, meeting individual needs would
prove uneconomic.
Derived demand
The demand for many B2B goods is derived from the demand for consumer
goods. If the demand for smartphones increases, the demand for lithium-ion
batteries, memory chips, cameras and other raw materials used to make phones
will also increase. So component manufacturers would be wise to monitor
consumer trends as well as their immediate B2B customers, like Apple Inc.,
Samsung and Sony.
Negotiations
Bearing in mind the size and complexity of B2B buying, negotiation between
professional buyers and sellers is often important. Thus, supermarkets will
negotiate with manufacturers about price, since their buying power allows
them to obtain discounts. Car manufacturers will negotiate attractive pricesfrom tyre manufacturers such as Pirelli and Michelin, but the replacement
brand must be an appropriate alternative. The supplier’s list price may be
regarded as the starting point for negotiation and the profit margin ultimately
achieved will be heavily influenced by the negotiating skills of the seller. The
implication is that sales and marketing personnel need to be conversant with
negotiating skills and tactics and, in many situations, should be aware of the
complexities involved in the negotiation process, particularly when the
products and services are also complicated, for example multichannel
advertising deals, where both internal and media intermediaries can be
involved in the negotiation.
Why is B2B Marketing Important?
B2B markets are arguably where marketing matters the most because, if
manufacturers, suppliers and resellers fail in providing the right products and
services, B2C markets cannot function effectively. The core principles of
marketing apply both strategically and tactically in these markets, but
differences exist, of which marketers involved in buying and selling should be
aware. Broadly, the marketing capabilities to consider are those that can impact
directly on customer relationships. By understanding the purchasing function,
marketers can determine who to target, decide on products and services,
organize sales processes and plan the communications mix.
Putting the customer at the core of marketing activities throughout the
organization is key. Buying is one such corporate activity and, although there
are similarities between consumer and B2B buying in terms of the stages of
the buying process, B2B buying is different in terms of scale, risk and
complexity. The implications of making wrong decisions in a B2B setting are
potentially far-reaching, as they could eventually lead to loss of market share,
job losses and even firm failure. Consequently, marketing managers need to
develop an understanding of buyer behaviour and the structure of the buying
group within the purchasing organization to trade effectively. This type of
buying requires considerable and detailed information searching and
methodical evaluation of alternatives. A key challenge for B2B buyers is to be
able to satisfy diverse requirements in a single offering. A product that
provides engineers with the performance characteristics they demand,
production managers with the delivery reliability they need, purchasingpage 158
managers with the value for money they seek and shop-floor workers with the
ease of installation they desire is likely to be highly successful. Understanding
who is responsible for purchasing, how they buy and what is purchased is
important, and has implications for the sales side of business activity. See

trading firm by focusing on customer needs.
MARKETING IN ACTION 4.4
Wing Yip: All the Chinese You Need to Know
When Wing Yip arrived in the UK from Hong Kong in 1959, it would have been difficult to
imagine how markets for oriental food would grow to the current level of popularity. Wing
worked as a waiter at a restaurant in Hull, East Yorkshire, where the limited ingredients
available restricted the range of Chinese dishes on the menu. In the early 1960s, with
partners, he opened two restaurants, in Clacton-on-Sea and Ipswich, but found it
increasingly difficult to obtain the quality and variety of ingredients needed to offer
interesting and innovative menus to meet the growing customer demand. Eventually, he
decided to sell his shares in the restaurants to fund a move into the food import business,
supplying restaurants and takeaways. He used his market knowledge and said, ‘after 10
years of running restaurants I knew what was required and opened a small shop in
Birmingham selling Chinese ingredients to the trade’.Source: Yau Ming Low/Shutterstock
From humble beginnings, he worked with his brothers, Sammy and Lee, to make Wing Yip
one of the UK’s leading suppliers of Oriental food and one of the biggest Chinese
supermarkets in the UK, with a turnover in excess of £118 million. Today, through its four
superstores in Birmingham, Manchester, Cricklewood and Croydon, and their online store,
Wing Yip supplies more than 4,500 Oriental products to the trade and has a growing
consumer customer base. Having started out with an exclusively Chinese product range, it
now encompasses all Far Eastern cuisine. Its customers can find everything they need,
from live lobsters and crabs to fresh vegetables. On the sales side, Wing Yip has a personal
selling sales team, and direct sales and deliveries via telemarketing and sales online. Wing
Yip aims to excel and to stay ahead of the competition.
Based on: Robinson (2020); Wing Yip (2022)
Large B2B organizations tend to have sufficient resources for all these
activities to be controlled internally under the umbrella of the marketing
function. For example, personal selling strategies can be decided by the sales
management team, advertising and sales promotion initiatives by the
marketing communications team and a publicity event by the public relations
department.
Conflicts between production and marketing functions can occur and this is
where the importance of an integrated effort comes to the fore. It is important
to apply this mix consistently so that communications tools and techniques
give out a consistent message, to avoid confusing customers. This can happen
if, for example, the advertising department creates messages that aim topage 159
convey a brand as high quality, while at the same time the sales team are using
heavy discounting and money-off sales promotions to sell their products. The
result can be that customers do not know what to think about the brand. Mixed
messages can seriously damage the customer perception of a brand and impede
relationship development.
Customer relationship management is important in B2B markets and
requires the sales force to focus on long-term goals and not simply on closing
the next sale. The emphasis should be on creating win/win situations with
customers so that both parties to the interaction gain from and want to continue
the relationship. For major customers, relationship management may involve
setting up dedicated teams (key account management) to service the account
and maintain all aspects of the business relationship, but for smaller customers,
social media, the web and the cloud offer solutions. Personal selling is a costly
form of communication, but can be ideally suited to B2B markets.
Managing sales teams involves achieving a balance between the cost of
sales generation and the revenue such activity generates. For example, when a
large telecoms firm wanted to reduce the cost of its sales force while
maintaining revenues, it reduced back-office support so it could protect the
frontline sales staff. The outcome was that the forward-facing sales
representatives started doing the administrative support tasks, reducing the
time they had to concentrate on selling. Eventually, more junior sales staff
were employed in the support role, but this forced costs up as they were more
expensive than the original back-office staff. A good principle to use when
looking at cost reductions in this area is to plan strategies that ‘do no harm’;
this is best achieved by systematically considering marketing systems and
business practices in the light of customer needs and behaviour (Agarwal et al.
2009). See Chapter 15 for more detailed coverage of this topic.
People and Processes in Purchasing
B2B buying behaviour involves the people who make the purchase decisions,
the stages in the buying process and the criteria used to inform the decision￾making process.Who makes buying decisions?
Buyers are important people as they can influence many aspects of a firm’s
operation. They are responsible for sourcing and selecting products, which
often involves complex decisions, but also for managing the buying process–
decisions that can impact on firm performance, suppliers and the workforce
(Lewis and Arnold 2012). However, it is important to understand in B2B
buying that the buyer, or purchasing officer, is often not the only person that
influences the decision or has the authority to make the ultimate decision.
Rather, the decision is in the hands of a decision-making unit (DMU), or
buying centre as it is sometimes called. This is not necessarily a fixed entity.
Members of the DMU may change as the decision-making process continues.
Thus, a managing director may be involved in the decision that new equipment
should be purchased, but not in the decision as to which manufacturer to buy it
from.
Six roles have been identified in the structure of the DMU, as follows
(Webster and Wind 1972):
1. Initiators: those who begin the purchase process, for example maintenance
managers.
2. Users: those who use the product, for example fabrication welders.
3. Deciders: those who have authority to select the supplier/model, for
example production managers.
4. Influencers: those who provide information and add decision criteria
throughout the process, for example accountants.
5. Buyers: those who have authority to execute the contractual arrangements,
for example purchasing officers.
6. Gatekeepers: those who control the flow of information, for example
secretaries who may allow or prevent access to a DMU member, or buyers
whose agreement must be sought before a supplier can contact other
members of the DMU.
Conceptually, a DMU resides within the buying organization.
Consequently, a decision-making unit is defined as a group of people within a
buying organization who are involved in the buying decision, although
external influences do come from trade promotions and advertising messages
from potential trade suppliers. Increasingly, the buying function is becoming a
more collaborative process as organizations seek to develop mutuallypage 160
beneficial long-term relationships. Read about how suppliers get involved in
the purchasing process in Mini Case 4.1. Distribution and channel
management is also discussed in detail in Chapter 16.
MINI CASE 4.1
Iceland Frozen Foods. Made in Asia
Iceland Foods Ltd has more than 300 suppliers and sources many of its products from
Southeast Asia, where there are highly skilled production companies that can produce the
quality of foodstuff that the buying team requires at a price that enables Iceland to offer
value to its customers in a highly competitive marketplace.
Source: Michaelpuche/Shutterstock
Iceland Foods Ltd has grown from a single retail store selling frozen foods in Oswestry
(Shropshire, UK) in 1970, to a national retail chain with more than 1,000 retail locations,
30,000 employees and a turnover in excess of £2.7 billion. The food retail marketplace is
challenging, and Iceland has faced aggressive competition from major grocery retailers
such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, from limited-range discounters Aldi and Lidl, and
from a variety of retailers such as Marks & Spencer (M&S). But Iceland has managed to
withstand attacks on its position by maintaining its competitive price proposition through its
product ranges.
Part of Iceland’s competitive armoury is its innovative food ranges; sometimes over 120
new products are introduced in one year. One of its most important ranges is its seasonal
party food. Iceland was the first firm to introduce large platters of Christmas party food, but
its competitors have been quick to follow into this product territory. Each year, Iceland’s
buying team works with suppliers to produce new products to reflect changing tastes andpage 161
market demand. New ranges include sushi platters, exotic mini-soufflés and new vegetarian
main courses. Many of the party ranges include Chinese and Indian foods and snacks and
are sourced in China.
Annually, the buying team sets objectives for the producers to enable development of new
product ranges. In 2018, environmental issues came to the forefront and suppliers had to
comply with Iceland’s promise to its customers of a ‘palm oil free Christmas’. Once the
products are ready, the buying team will visit suppliers in China to sample the new product
ranges and test the extent to which their objectives have been met. Iceland’s buyers taste
the products, evaluate the actual look of the products and determine how many items of
which foodstuffs might be offered. The buyers must also ensure that they can offer sufficient
value to the retail customer at a profit. Once potential ranges have been selected, they are
brought back to the UK and tested by in-house teams for ease of use, cooking instructions
and taste. Sometimes Iceland’s buyers go back to the producer to seek modifications to
products, perhaps because they don’t have the right appeal, flavour or cost base.
Packaging design, the amount of content and promotional offers are also considered as part
of the buying decision, as it is important to be able to offer the right value to the consumer.
The final decision about which products make it into Iceland are made by the head buyer
and, following a final round of testing, by the senior management team.
The buying team at Iceland plays a very important role in ensuring that the retailer can stay
ahead of the competition and retain its market share. But the buying team does not work
alone: suppliers, packaging designers, taste-testers, users and the senior management
team are all involved in putting together food ranges.
Questions:
1. Discuss the extent to which Iceland’s buying team fits the conceptual model of a
DMU.
2. Build a case report that shows the importance of the buying function at Iceland and
highlight the potential impact of wrong buying decisions.
Based on: Pomeroy (2013); Selwood (2018); Iceland Foods Ltd (2022)
For very important decisions, the structure of the DMU will be complex,
involving numerous people within the buying organization. The marketing task
is to identify and reach the key members to convince them of the product’s
worth. Often, communicating to the purchasing officer alone will be
insufficient, as this person may be only a minor influence on supplier choice.
Relationship management is of key importance in many B2B markets
(discussed in detail in Chapter 5).When the problem to be solved is highly technical, suppliers may work
with a data scientist, engineers and other experts in the buying organization to
solve problems and secure the order. In fact, this is becoming increasingly
important and B2B marketing is focusing more on accelerating deals through
collaborations than on generating demand.
Often B2B purchases are made in committees where the salesperson will
not be present. The salesperson’s task is to identify a person from within the
decision-making unit who is a positive advocate and champion of the
supplier’s product. This person (or ‘coach’) should be given all the information
needed to win the arguments that may take place within the decision-making
unit. For example, even though the advocate may be a technical person, they
should be given the financial information that may be necessary to justify
buying the most technologically superior product.
Where DMU members are inaccessible to salespeople, advertising, the
internet, social media or direct marketing tools may be used as alternatives.
Stages in the buying process: how they buy
Figure 4.8 describes the basics of the decision-making process for a B2B
product (Robinson et al. 1967). The exact nature of the process will depend on
the buying situation. In some situations, some stages will be omitted. For
example, in a routine rebuy situation the purchasing officer is unlikely to pass
through the third, fourth and fifth stages (search for suppliers, and analysis and
evaluation of their proposals). These stages will be bypassed, as the buyer,
recognizing a need–perhaps shortage of stationery–routinely reorders from an
existing supplier. In general, the more complex the decision and the more
expensive the item, the more likely it is that each stage will be passed through
and that the process will take more time.
FIGURE 4.8
Buy phases: the B2B decision-making processEach of the stages is now described.
Recognition of a problem (need)
Needs and problems may be recognized through either internal or external
factors (Jobber and Lancaster 2019). An example of an internal factor would
be the realization of under-capacity leading to the decision to purchase plant or
equipment. Thus, internal recognition leads to active behaviour. Some
problems recognized internally may not be acted upon. This condition may be
termed internal/passive. A production manager may realize there is a problem
with a machine but, given more pressing problems, decides to put up with it.
Different problems have important implications for marketing and sales.
The internal/passive condition implies there’s an opportunity for a salesperson,
having identified the condition, to highlight the problem by careful analysis ofpage 162
cost inefficiencies and other symptoms, so that the problem is perceived to be
pressing and in need of a solution (internal/active). Producing loaves of bread
uses a lot of energy, from heating ovens, to steamers and coolers, so becoming
more energy efficient could solve cost inefficiencies. When Cooplands, a
family-owned bakery which produces pastries, bread and cakes for its 160
shops and 12 cafés, wanted to expand in order to increase sales, director
William McIlroy had an energy challenge, which involved finding the most
energy-efficient refrigeration systems to replace old equipment. SRS Frigadon,
which produces energy-efficient chillers that use Scandinavian technology to
deliver benefits including increased energy efficiency, low climate impact and
low energy consumption, was ideal to solve Mr McIlroy’s
problems. He said, ‘we have now achieved the ultimate in
installing a totally green and environmentally friendly installation without the
deployment of any volatile HFC refrigerant gases’ (SRS Frigadon 2022). SRS
Frigadon has been providing energy solutions and solving problems for over
17 years for many well-known brands (e.g. Sainsbury’s, Nestlé, Asda/Walmart,
Roche Pharmaceuticals) (see Exhibit 4.8).

Determination of specification and quantity of needed item
At this stage of the decision-making process, the DMU will draw up a
description of what is required. For example, to protect its personal data a
market research firm may require an upgrade to its computer network security
systems. Darktrace is a firm that sells Antigena (Darktrace 2022), whichprovides autonomous response technology that can stop email phishing and
interrupt cyber attacks to reduce computer hacking incidents. The ability of
sales and marketing teams of firms providing such products can influence the
specification set by the buyer and give their firm an advantage at later stages of
the process. By persuading the buying firm to specify features that only the
marketer’s own product possesses, the sale may be virtually closed at this
stage. This is the process of setting up lockout criteria.
Search for and qualification of potential sources
A great deal of variation in the degree of search takes place in B2B buying.
The cheaper and less important the item, and the more information the buyer
possesses, the less search takes place. Marketers can use advertising to ensure
that their brands are in the buyer’s awareness set and are, therefore, considered
when evaluating alternatives.
Acquisition and analysis of proposals
Having found several companies, perhaps through their technical expertise and
general reputation, who are qualified to supply the product, proposals will be
called for and analysis of them undertaken.
Evaluation of proposals and selection of supplier(s)
Each proposal will be evaluated in the light of the choice criteria deemed to be
more important to each DMU member. It is important to realize that various
members may use different criteria when judging proposals. Although this may
cause problems, the outcome of this procedure is the selection of a supplier or
suppliers.
Selection of an order routine
Next, the details of payment and delivery are drawn up. Usually this is
conducted by the purchasing officer. In some buying decisions–when delivery
is an important consideration in selecting a supplier–this stage is merged into
the acquisition and evaluation stages.
Performance feedback and evaluationpage 163
This may be formal, where a purchasing department draws up an evaluation
form for user departments to complete, or informal through everyday
conversations.
The implications of all this are that sales and marketing strategy can affect
a sale through influencing need recognition, through the design of product
specifications, and by clearly presenting the advantages of the product or
service over those of the competition in terms that are relevant to DMU
members. By early involvement, a firm can benefit through the process of
creeping commitment, whereby the buying organization becomes increasingly
committed to one supplier through its involvement in the process and the
technical assistance it provides.
Choice criteria
This aspect of B2B buyer behaviour refers to the criteria used by members of
the DMU to evaluate supplier proposals. These criteria are likely to be
determined by the performance criteria used to evaluate the members
themselves (Draper 1994). In a similar manner to buying for consumers, B2B
buying is characterized by technical, economic, social (organizational) and
personal criteria. Economic and technical considerations are key, especially for
major investment in, say, new IT systems and software, which has implications
throughout an organization. For materials and component parts, choice criteria
may focus on more immediate gains: cost savings, delivery reliability, quality
and technical assistance. Customer service factors may be important when
suppliers’ product offerings are similar. The motivations of key players
involved in B2B purchasing and the criteria they use to compare supplier
offerings have implications for marketing. For example, economic
considerations need to be appropriate and enable the buyers to meet their profit
objectives and work within budgetary constraints. Emotional factors should
not be totally ignored, as decisions are made by people who do not suddenly
lose their personalities, personal likes and dislikes, and prejudices simply
because they are at work. Let us examine several important technical and
economic motives (quality, price and lifecycle costs, and continuity of supply)
and then some organizational and personal factors (perceived risk, office
politics and personal likes/dislikes).Quality
Ensuring quality is critical as replacing faulty components or dealing with
returned goods is costly and impacts on a firm’s reputation. Customers are
unlikely to be satisfied if quality is not satisfactory. Formal procedures and
standards apply in industrial and reseller markets, to ensure that quality
requirements and procedures are met. Service quality can be assessed by
reliability, responsiveness and assurance. Product quality can be assessed by
performance, durability and design. Both sets of criteria are considered further
in Chapters 9 and 11 respectively.
Price and lifecycle costs
For materials and components of similar specification and quality, price
becomes a key consideration. For standard items (e.g. office supplies), price
may be critical for a sale to be agreed as several suppliers can meet delivery
and specification requirements. Much of this type of purchasing is done via e￾commerce systems, but criteria are still relevant. Where personal negotiations
are involved, large buying organizations can exert power to squeeze suppliers
for better terms. For example, to remain competitive, when Tesco launched its
Price Drop initiative, many other supermarkets demanded reductions from
their suppliers. Waitrose entered negotiations for a 5 per cent reduction from
its ambient food suppliers to enable a new price-led marketing strategy, ‘1000s
of ways to great value’ (Heagarty 2011).
Price is only one component of cost for many buying organizations.
Increasingly, buyers consider lifecycle costs, which may include productivity
savings, maintenance costs and residual values, as well as initial purchase
price, when evaluating products. Marketers can use lifecycle costs analysis to
break into an account. By calculating lifecycle costs with a buyer, new
perceptions of value may be achieved.
Continuity of supply
Another major cost to a firm is disruption of a production run. Delays of this
kind can mean costly machine downtime and even lost sales. Continuity of
supply is, therefore, a prime consideration in many purchase situations. If a
supplier performs badly on this criterion they will lose out even if the price is
competitive because a small percentage price edge does not compare with the
costs of unreliable delivery. Suppliers that guarantee deliveries and realizepage 164
their promises can achieve a significant differential advantage in the
marketplace. B2B customers are demanding close relationships with
accredited suppliers that can guarantee reliable supply, perhaps on a just-in￾time (JIT) basis.
Perceived risk
Perceived risk can come in two forms: functional risk such as uncertainty with
respect to product or supplier performance, and psychological risk such as
criticism from work colleagues. This latter risk–fear of upsetting the boss,
losing status, being ridiculed by others in the department, or indeed of losing
one’s job–can play a determining role in purchase decisions. Buyers often
reduce uncertainty by gathering information about competing suppliers,
checking the opinions of important others in the buying firm, buying only from
familiar and/or reputable suppliers and by spreading risk through multiple
sourcing. Office politics may influence the outcome of a buying decision and
have implications for the departments and individuals concerned.
Personal likes/dislikes
A buyer may personally like one salesperson more than another and this may
influence supplier choice, particularly when competing products are very
similar. Perception is important in all B2B purchases, since how someone
behaves depends upon that person’s perception of the situation. One buyer may
perceive a salesperson as being honest, truthful and likeable, while another
may not. However, analysis and managing of spending has become more
closely monitored in recent years due to the widespread adoption of
procurement and information systems related to e-commerce. Many firms have
actively sought to introduce purchasing policies that reduce ‘maverick
spending’–that is, reduce buying from non-preferred firm suppliers (see
Marketing in Action 4.5).MARKETING IN ACTION 4.5
Is Eliminating the Mavericks a Good Thing?
Maverick spending is often referred to as the deals that are done outside an organization’s
procurement policy. This type of spending might occur when a powerful B2B buyer has a
personal preference for a particular supplier (rather than the organization itself preferring a
particular supplier). In this case, the firm will be referred to as ‘an off-contract supplier’.
Furthermore, the practice is said to be widespread, with some firms experiencing up to 80
per cent of buying being uncontrolled and sourced from off-contract suppliers.
The difference between non-preferred and preferred suppliers is that the latter are
established by determining their ability to comply with a buying firm’s specification, for
example agreed discount targets, delivery routines and quality of goods. As a result, firms
are increasingly investing in IT systems to gather data and analyse the efficiency of buying
and selling with a view to reducing maverick spending, so as to bring about budget cost
savings.
However, sometimes the maverick spend is not about defying purchasing policies but about
finding better purchasing solutions. Also, buying is a complex function: implementing an IT
system that effectively tracks all the nuances of purchasing agreements and deals can be
costly and time-consuming, and may not result in the ideal purchasing outcome. So while,
on one hand, reducing maverick spending can ensure compliance with purchasing policy,
potentially reducing the overall budget spend and maximizing purchasing power, on the
other hand, this might lead to missed buying opportunities and increased cost through
significant investment in sophisticated IT systems to manage the maverick spending.

E-procurement processes
B2B e-procurement accounts for significant volumes of trade, and modern e￾procurement systems enable companies to fulfil a range of activities and
processes associated with the purchasing function: tendering, awarding
contracts, establishing contractual agreements and ordering (Doherty et al.
2013). To action these processes, firms not only create their own websites but
also develop extranets for buyers to send out requests for bids to suppliers.
Online purchasing systems can take various formats:
Catalogue sites: firms can order items through electronic catalogues.
Vertical markets: firms buying industrial products such as steel, chemicals
or plastic, or buying services such as logistics (distribution) or media, can
use specialized websites (called e-hubs).page 165
Auction sites: suppliers can place industrial products on auction sites, where
purchasers can bid for them.
Exchange (or spot) markets: many commodities are sold on electronic
exchange markets, where prices can change by the minute.
Buying alliances: firms in the same market for products join together to gain
bigger discounts on higher volumes.
Pay-to-procure (P2P) software systems enable the integration of the
purchasing function across a business from purchase request to payment.
Industrial and reseller markets have seen widespread adoption of e￾procurement systems but, in government markets, the adoption of e￾procurement systems has been slow in comparison with the adoption in B2B
and reseller markets. The people and processes involved in B2B purchasing
are many and, as more purchasing is done online, this does not reduce the
strategic importance of choice criteria but is having an impact on the number
of people and influences involved in purchasing decisions.
Influences on Buying Decisions
Recent events such as the Covid-19 pandemic, natural disasters and blockages
in global supply chains, impact on firms and cause them to rethink their
supplier base. More firms are looking to diversify suppliers and find ways to
create value by buyers and suppliers working together for mutual benefit (Jia
et al. 2022). Figure 4.9 shows basic factors influencing how organizations buy,
who buys and how they apply choice criteria: the buy class, the product type
and the importance of purchase (Cardozo 1980).
FIGURE 4.9
Factors influencing how organizations buy, who buys and how they apply choice
criteriaThe buy class
B2B purchases can be a new task, a straight rebuy and a modified rebuy
(Robinson et al. 1967). A new task occurs when the need for the product has
not arisen previously, so there is little or no relevant experience in the firm and
a great deal of information is required. A straight rebuy occurs where an
organization buys previously purchased items from suppliers already judged
acceptable. Routine purchasing procedures are set up to facilitate straight
rebuys. The modified rebuy lies between the two extremes. A regular
requirement for the type of product exists, and the buying alternatives are
known, but sufficient change (e.g. a delivery problem) has occurred to require
some alteration to the normal supply procedure.
The buy classes affect B2B buying in the following ways:
First, the membership of the DMU changes. For a straight rebuy, possibly
only the purchasing officer is involved, whereas for a new buy senior
management, engineers, production managers and purchasing officers may
be involved. Modified rebuys often involve engineers, production managers
and purchasing officers, but senior management, except when the purchase
is critical to the firm, is unlikely to be involved.
Second, the decision-making process may be much longer as the buy class
changes from a straight rebuy to a modified rebuy to a new task.page 166
Third, DMU members are likely to be much more receptive to new task and
modified rebuy situations than to straight rebuys. In the latter case, the
purchasing manager has already solved the purchasing problem and has
other problems to deal with. So, why make it a problem again?
The first implication of this buy class analysis is that there are big gains to
be made if a firm can enter the new task at the start of the decision-making
process. By providing information and helping with any technical problems
that can arise, the firm may be able to create goodwill and creeping
commitment, which secures the order when the final decision is made. The
second implication is, since the decision process is likely to be long and many
people are involved in the new task, supplier companies need to invest heavily
in sales personnel for a considerable period. Some firms employ missionary
sales teams comprising their best salespeople to help secure big new-task
orders.
Firms in straight rebuy situations must ensure that no change occurs when
they are in the position of the supplier. Regular contact to ensure that the
customer has no complaints may be necessary, and the buyer may be
encouraged to use automatic reordering systems. For the out-supplier (i.e. the
new potential supplier), the task can be difficult unless poor service or some
other factor has caused the buyer to become dissatisfied with the present
supplier. The obvious objective of the out-supplier in this situation is to change
the buy class from a straight rebuy to a modified rebuy. Price alone may not be
enough since changing supplier represents a large personal risk to the
purchasing officer. The new supplier’s products might be less reliable, and
delivery might be unpredictable. To reduce this risk, the firm may offer
delivery guarantees with penalty clauses and be very willing to accept a small
(perhaps uneconomic) order at first to gain a foothold. Supplier acquisition of
a total quality management (TQM) standard such as ISO
9001:2000 or ISO 9004 may also have the effect of reducing
perceived buyer risk. Other tactics are the use of testimonials from satisfied
customers, and demonstrations. Many straight rebuys are organized on a
contract basis, and buyers may be more receptive to listening to non-suppliers
prior to contract renewal.
Value analysis and lifecycle cost calculations enable purchases to move
from a straight rebuy to a modified rebuy situation. Value analysis can be
conducted by either supplier or buyer as method of cost reduction when
purchasing goods and components, and is studied to identify unnecessary costs
that do not add to the reliability or functionality of the product. Byredesigning, standardizing or manufacturing by less expensive means, a
supplier may be able to offer a product of comparable quality at lower cost.
Lifecycle cost analysis seeks to move the cost focus from the initial purchase
price to the total cost of owning and using a product. There are three types of
lifecycle costs: purchase price, start-up costs and post-purchase costs (Forbis
and Mehta 1981). Start-up costs would include installation, lost production and
training costs. Post-purchase costs include operating (e.g. fuel, operator
wages), maintenance, repair and inventory costs. Against these costs would be
placed residual values (e.g. trade-in values of cars). Lifecycle cost appeals can
be powerful motivators. For example, if the out-supplier can convince the
customer organization its product has significantly lower post-purchase costs
than the in-supplier’s, despite a slightly higher purchase price, it may win the
order. This is because it will be delivering a higher economic value to the
customer. This can be a powerful competitive advantage and, at the same time,
justify the premium price.
The product type
Products can be classified as four types: materials, components, plant and
equipment, and MROs (maintenance, repair and operation), as follows:
1. materials to be used in the production process, such as aluminium
2. components to be incorporated into the finished product, such as headlights
3. plant and equipment, such as a bulldozer
4. products and services for maintenance, repair and operation (MRO), such as
spanners, welding equipment and lubricants.
This classification is based on how the product is used and may be
employed to identify differences in B2B buyer behaviour. First, people who
take part in the decision-making process tend to change according to product
type. For example, senior management tend to get involved in the purchase of
plant and equipment or, occasionally, when new materials are purchased if the
change is of fundamental importance to firm operations, for example if a move
from aluminium to plastic is being considered. Rarely do they involve
themselves in component or MRO supply. Similarly, design engineers tend to
be involved in buying components and materials, but not normally MRO and
plant equipment. Second, the decision-making process tends to be slower and
more complex as product type moves from MRO → components → materials
→ plant and equipmentpage 167
For MRO items, blanket contracts rather than periodic purchase orders are
increasingly being used. The supplier agrees to resupply the buyer on agreed
price terms over a period. Stock is held by the seller and orders are
automatically printed out by the buyer’s computer when stock falls below a
minimum level. This has the advantage to the supplying firm of effectively
blocking the effort of competitors for long periods of time.
Classification of suppliers’ offerings by product type gives clues as to who
is likely to be influenced in the purchase decision. The marketing task is then
to confirm this situation and attempt to reach those people involved. A firm
selling MROs is likely to be wasting effort attempting to communicate with
design engineers, whereas attempts to reach operating management are likely
to prove fruitful.
The importance of purchase
A purchase is likely to be perceived as important to the buyer when large sums
of money are involved, when the cost of making the wrong decision–for
example, in production downtime–is high, and when there is considerable
uncertainty about the outcome of alternative offerings. In such situations,
many people at different organizational levels are part of the decision, which
will be complex and involve extensive search and analysis of information.
Extensive marketing effort is required, but great opportunities present
themselves to those sales teams working with the buying organizations to
convince them that their offering has the best pay-off. This may involve
acceptance trials, for example private diesel manufacturers supply railway
companies with prototypes for testing, engineering support and testimonials
from other users. Additionally, guarantees of delivery dates and after-sales
service may be necessary when buyer uncertainty regarding these factors is
high.Big Picture: Key Topics in This

 Detailed Review
1. The context and dimensions of consumer behaviour
The dimensions of the buying decisions–how they buy, what their choice criteria
are, where they buy and when they buy–help identify what is important, and has
implications for the marketing mix.
2. The role of the buying centre (who buys) and its implications
A group decision may be in the hands of a buying centre with five roles: initiator,
influencer, decider, buyer and user. The interaction between roles determines
whether a purchase is made.
Marketers should understand buying groups to help in targeting and segmenting
markets, and planning the core strategy.
3. The consumer decision-making process (how people buy)
The decision to purchase a consumer product may pass through
various stages: need recognition/problem awareness; information search;
evaluation of alternatives; purchase and post-purchase evaluation of the decision.
4. The marketing implications of the consumer decision-making process
Each stage in the process has implications for marketing managers:
Need recognition: awareness of consumer problems can create opportunities for
building a competitive advantage and planning strategies to overcome any need
inhibitors; stimulating need recognition through marketing communications might
help initiate the decision-making process.
Information search: knowing where consumers look for information to help solve
their decision-making can aid marketing planning. Communication can direct
consumers to suitable sources of information. One objective is to ensure that the
firm’s brand appears in the consumer’s awareness set.
Evaluation of alternatives: when a consumer is highly involved, they require more
information about the positives of making a particular buying decision than in a
low-involvement buying situation. For low-involvement decisions, creating top-of￾mind awareness through repetitive advertising and trial (e.g. through sales
promotion) can aid the decision-making. For all consumer decisions, marketing
managers must understand the choice criteria used to evaluate brands, including
the importance of emotion.
Post-purchase evaluation: consumers can experience cognitive dissonance after
making a purchase and might need reassurance. Marketing communication
initiatives can act as positive reinforcers.
5. The differences in evaluation of high- versus low-involvement situations
High-involvement situations: consumers are likely to carry out extensive evaluation
and take into account beliefs about the perceived consequences of buying the
brand, the extent to which others believe they should or should not buy the brand,
attitudes (which are the degree to which the consumer likes or dislikes the brand
overall) and subjective norms (which form an overall evaluation of the degree to
which others approve or disapprove of the purchase).page 169
Low-involvement situations: consumer carries out a simple evaluation and uses
simple choice tactics to reduce time and effort. Awareness precedes trial, which, if
satisfactory, leads to repeat purchase. The behaviour may become habitual, with
little conscious thought or formation of attitudes before purchase.
6. The nature of choice criteria (what are used) and their implications
Choice criteria are the various attributes (and benefits) a consumer uses when
evaluating products and services. These may be technical (e.g. reliability),
economic (e.g. price), social (e.g. status) or personal (e.g. self-image).
7. The influences on consumer behaviour–the buying situation, personal and
social influences–and implications for marketing
Buying situation: the three types are extended problem-solving, limited problem￾solving and habitual problem-solving. The marketing implications for each type
are: extended problem-solving–provide information-rich communications; limited
problem-solving–stimulate the need to conduct a search (when their brand is not
currently bought) or reduce the risk of brand switching; habitual problem-solving–
repetitive advertising should be used to create awareness and reinforce already
favourable attitudes.
Personal influences: the six types are information processing, motivation, beliefs
and attitudes, personality, lifestyle, and lifecycle and age, and they all have
implications for marketing.
Social influences: the four types are culture, social class, geodemographics and
reference groups:
1) Culture affects how business is conducted and consumption behaviour.
Marketers have to adjust their behaviour and the marketing mix to
accommodate different cultures.
2) Social class can predict some consumption patterns, and so can be used for
market segmentation and targeting purposes.
3) Geodemographics classifies consumers according to their location, and is used
for market segmentation and targeting purposes.
4) Reference groups influence their members by the roles and norms expected of
them. Marketers attempt to make their brands acceptable to reference groups,
and target opinion leaders to gain brand acceptability.
8. The importance of B2B markets
Organizational markets are significant and account for nearly half of
all revenues in developed countries.
There are three types of organizational markets: industrial, resellers and
government/institutional markets.
9. The characteristics of B2B buying
The characteristics are based on the nature and size of customers, the complexity
of buying, the use of economic and technical choice criteria, network technology
and e-commerce, the risky nature of buying and selling, buying to specific
requirements, reciprocal buying, derived demand and negotiations.
10. What is B2B marketing?B2B involves manufacturers, suppliers and resellers in providing the right products
and services so that B2C markets can function effectively. All the core principles of
marketing apply both strategically and tactically in these markets, but differences
exist in terms of buying and selling.
Buying is an important corporate activity and its coordination is crucial for
marketing organizations.
B2B communications primarily involve personal direct selling and digital marketing.
11. The nature and marketing implications of the people: who buys, the processes
involved in how organizations buy and the choice criteria used to evaluate
products
Who buys: there are six roles in the decision-making unit–initiators, users,
deciders, influencers, buyers and gatekeepers. Marketers need to identify who
plays each role, target communication at them and develop products to satisfy
their needs.
How organizations buy: the decision-making process has up to seven stages–
recognition of problem (need), determination of specification and quantity of
needed item, search for and qualification of potential sources, acquisition and
analysis of proposals, evaluation of proposals and selection of supplier(s),
selection of an order routine, and performance feedback and evaluation.
Marketers can influence need recognition and gain competitive advantage by
entering the process early.
Choice criteria can be technical, economic, social (organizational) and personal.
Marketers need to understand the choice criteria of the different members of the
decision-making unit and target communications accordingly. Other marketing mix
decisions, such as product design, will also depend on an understanding of choice
criteria. Choice criteria can change over time, necessitating a change in the
marketing mix.
12. The influences on B2B buying behaviour–the buy class, product type and
purchase importance–and their marketing implications
The buy class consists of three types: new task, straight rebuy and modified rebuy.
For a new task, there can be large gains for suppliers entering the decision
process early, but heavy investment is usually needed. For straight rebuys, the in￾supplier should build a defensible position to keep out new potential suppliers. For
out-suppliers, a key task is to reduce the risk of change for the buyers so that a
modified rebuy will result.
Product types consist of materials, components, plant and equipment, and
maintenance items. Marketers need to recognize that the people who take part in
the purchase decision usually change according to product type, and channel
communications accordingly.
The importance of purchase depends on the costs involved and the uncertainty
(risk) regarding the decision. For very important decisions, heavy investment is
likely to be required on the part of suppliers, and risk-reduction strategies (e.g.
guarantees) may be needed to reduce uncertainty.

COFFEE SHOP WARS
The Battle of the Coffee Shops
The UK has come a long way from the days when a request for coffee would bring a cup of
uniformly grey, unappealing liquid, sometimes served in polystyrene cups, which bore no
relation to the rich, flavoursome coffee experienced on trips to continental Europe. The origin of
this change was not Europe, however, but the US, where the coffee shop culture was
grounded.
Recent years have seen an explosion of coffee shops on UK high streets, with more than five
million lattés, cappuccinos and espressos served per week. The market is dominated by Costa
Coffee with more than 2,600 coffee shops, US-owned Starbucks with 1,025, and Caffè Nero
with 648. In total, the UK has more than 8,000 branded coffee shops, all charging over £2.50
(€2.80) for a small coffee. Often three or more shops are located within 100 metres of each
other.
Once the preserve of town and city centres, coffee shops have moved to other locations, such
as rail stations, airports, bookshops, hotels, hospitals, out-of-town shopping precincts and retail
parks, supermarkets, department stores and suburban areas. Wholesale supply divisions of the
major players provide coffee to such establishments as caterers, health clubs and offices. A
more recent innovation has been the growth of drive-through coffee shops.
In 2018 Whitbread the owner of Costa Coffee faced pressure from two of its largest
shareholders to sell Costa Coffee, the rationale being that the individual businesses (Whitbread
also owned the Premier Inn budget hotel chain) were worth more than the one company
combined. Consequently, Costa Coffee was sold to Coca-Cola in a multi-billion-pound deal.
The first US West Coast style coffee shop was opened in the UK in 1995 and was called the
Seattle Coffee Company. The owners were Americans who saw an opportunity to serve the
British with good-quality coffee in relaxed surroundings just like they experienced in the US.
The concept was a huge success, and by 1997 the company had 49 coffee outlets. It was
joined by Coffee Republic and Caffè Nero, which also grew rapidly. In 1997, however, the
coffee market in the UK was to change dramatically with the arrival of the US-based Starbucks
coffee shop giant, which bought the Seattle Coffee Company.
Its strategy was to gain market share through fast roll-out. For the first five years, Starbucks
opened an average of five shops a month in the UK–in 1999 it had 95 shops, by 2021 this had
increased to 1,025. Today, Starbucks is in the Fortune Top 500 US companies and has over
32,000 coffee shops in more than 76 countries. Its approach is simple: blanket an area
completely, even if the shops cannibalize one another’s business. A new coffee bar will often
capture about 30 per cent of the sales of a nearby Starbucks, but the company considered thispage 176
was more than offset by lower delivery and management costs (per shop), shorter queues at
individual shops and increased foot traffic for all the shops in an area, as new shops take
custom from competitors too. More than 20 million people buy coffee at Starbucks every week,
with the average Starbucks customer visiting 18 times a month.

One of its traditional strengths was the quality of its coffee. Starbucks has its own roasting
plant, from which the media are banned lest its secrets be revealed. In its coffee shops, coffee
is mixed with a lot of milk and offered in hundreds of flavours. Its Frappuccino is
positioned as a midday break, in advertisements where a narrator explains
‘Starbucks Frappuccino coffee drink is a delicious blend of coffee and milk to smooth out your
day.’ The tagline is ‘Smooth out your day, every day.’
A key problem was that Starbucks’ major competitors, Costa Coffee and Caffè Nero, also
followed a fast roll-out strategy, causing rental prices to spiral upwards. For example,
Starbucks’ Leicester Square coffee shop in London was part of a £1.5 million (€1.7 million) two￾shop rental deal. Many coffee shops were not profitable; Starbucks, because it continued to
operate them, was accused of unfairly trying to squeeze out the competition. However, the
recession brought rental prices down, allowing the chains, especially Costa Coffee, to expand
rapidly. All three major players are now profitable.
The typical consumers at these coffee bars are young, single and high earners. They are likely
to be professionals–senior or middle managers with company cars. Students also are an
important part of the market. Coffee bars are seen as a ‘little bit of heaven’, a refuge where
consumers can lounge on sofas, read broadsheet newspapers and view New Age poetry on the
walls. They provide an oasis of calm for people between their homes and offices. They are
regarded as a sign of social mobility for people who may be moving out of an ordinary café or
low-end department store into something more classy. Even the language is important for these
consumers: terms such as latté, cappuccino and espresso allow them to demonstrate
connoisseurship. Consumers are offered a wide choice of combinations, including a sprinkling
of marshmallow, syrup and an extra shot of espresso.
Coffee bars also cater for the different moods of consumers. For example, Sahar Hashemi, a
founding partner of Coffee Republic, explained: ‘If I’m in my routine, I’ll have a tall, skinny latté.
But if I’m feeling in a celebratory mood or like spoiling myself, it’s a grand vanilla mocha with
whip and marshmallows.’
Starbucks has expanded the services it provides by offering a Wi-Fi service that allows laptop
users to gain high-speed internet access. This service has been copied by Costa Coffee andpage 177
Caffè Nero.
Starbucks, Costa Coffee and Caffè Nero offer food alongside drinks. Starbucks targets
breakfast, lunch and snack times with a limited range of both indulgent and healthy eating
options. Costa Coffee has been offering hot foods and salads since 2002. Caffè Nero’s food
offer is integral to its Italian-style positioning, with most of the ingredients for its meals coming
from Italy.
Many of the coffee shops have four zones. The first is at the front of the store, where customers
can look outside and passers-by can see there are people inside. The second is an area
containing perch seating, reminiscent of coffee houses in Italy. The third zone offers large
community tables where groups or individuals can work on their laptops or read. Finally, softer
seating creates a more intimate and relaxed zone.
The chains have also embraced the fair trade coffee idea, with Costa Coffee offering such
products since 2000 and Starbucks introducing fair trade coffee in 2002. The three chains buy
their coffee beans almost entirely from sustainable sources, paying up to 12 per cent above
average world prices. Low-calorie drinks are also offered.
Declining performance at Starbucks led to the reappointment in 2008 of Howard Schultz as
chief executive, the man who grew the firm from just four outlets to more than 32,000 today. He
identified Starbucks’ problems as stemming from its outlets losing their ‘romance and theatre’.
He pointed out that the distinctive aroma of fresh coffee was less evident because of the advent
of vacuum-sealed, flavour-locked packaging. Also, the use of new automated machines meant
that customers could not see their drinks being prepared–eliminating an ‘intimate experience’
with the barista and impairing the spectacle of coffee-making. The result, he concluded, was
that some customers found Starbucks coffee shops sterile places that no longer reflected a
passion for coffee. The situation was made worse by the smell of sandwiches, which often
overpowered the aroma of coffee. Some Starbucks staff were also criticized as being unfriendly.
The problems facing Starbucks were worsened by a strong challenge from McDonald’s, which
opened McCafés in some of its outlets, where customers can buy similar drinks at a cheaper
price. Artisan coffee shops also posed a strong threat as some consumers rejected the
corporates in favour of small independent outlets. Starbucks’ woes continued with a report from
the consumer magazine Which? that showed Starbucks coffee was inferior to that of Costa
Coffee and Caffè Nero, which came out on top. It was also the most expensive.
Schultz began to address some of these problems by introducing new, smaller espresso
machines, so customers can once again see the baristas making their drinks. Coffee is once
again being ground by hand, restoring the aroma, and a less potent-smelling cheese is being
used in Starbucks’ sandwiches. The baristas have all been retrained, not only in the art of
making excellent coffee but also in connecting better with customers. The interiors of many of
Starbucks’ coffee shops have been renovated and redesigned.
To make the outlets more attractive during the recession, a new instant coffee brand, VIA, was
launched, which Starbucks claimed tasted as good as ground coffee but at a much cheaper
price. The company also introduced a loyalty card that allowed free extras such as a shot of
whipped cream, syrup or soy in coffee. As with Wi-Fi, this innovation was copied by its rivals. A
further change was the dropping of the ‘Starbucks Coffee’ logo from its mugs and changing the
colour of its ‘siren’ figure from black to green.Starbucks also extended its brand by an alliance with Nestlé, which gained the global rights to
sell the coffee chain’s bagged coffee, drinks and Nespresso-style pods, gaining its expertise in
marketing to the retail grocery sector. Costa Coffee also markets its brand of coffee in
supermarkets and online.
Meanwhile, Costa Coffee moved into the self-service market by buying Coffee Nation and its
900 vending machines. The offering carries the Costa Express branding, and uses fresh milk
and fresh coffee beans, roasted by Costa in London. While using the machine, the customer is
treated to the gentle buzz of a coffee shop and the smell of pain au chocolat. By 2021, the
company had expanded to a total of more than 9,000 highly profitable vending machines in the
UK. This move created self-service opportunities in such locations as offices, supermarkets,
universities, rail stations, hospitals, petrol stations and convenience stores.
Questions
1. Why have coffee shops been so popular with consumers?
2. You are considering visiting a coffee shop for the first time. What would influence your
choice of coffee shop to visit? Is this likely to be a high- or low-involvement decision?
3. Assess the coffee chains’ moves to expand the offerings they provide for their customers.
4. What are the benefits to both parties of Coca-Cola’s acquisition of Costa Coffee?

NAKED WINES: A
COMMUNITY OF
WINEMAKERS AND WINE
DRINKERS
In June 2008, founder and CEO of Virgin Wines Rowan Gormley was attempting a
management buyout from parent group Direct Wines. The result was he got the sack. ‘It was
the best thing that ever happened to me,’ says Rowan, because six months later Naked Wines
was born. This innovative online wine company, which does things differently, is now owned by
Majestic Wine and its business model uses crowdfunding to support independent winemakers.Source: Naked Wines
Community Networking Drives the Business
Model
The concept was to bring crowdfunding to the world of winemaking via the internet. At its heart
is ‘a community of wine drinkers’ who join Naked and make regular payments, starting at £20 a
month, into an online account. The name given to this special group of community members is
Angels, as they help independent winemakers achieve their dreams by investing their regular
contributions into the vintners’ businesses. They then have no worries about selling the wine
and just need to concentrate on producing a quality product. In return the Angels receive a
substantial discount when purchasing the wine. Paying for the product in advance is like the
way we purchase airline and travel tickets, but is an unusual approach to pricing in the retail
wine Industry.
Now with more than 200,000 Angels, generating a cool £3.5 million a month, those investments
are substantial and help support a ‘community of winemakers’, producing new, interesting
wines that cannot be purchased elsewhere.
This co-creation of value approach between winemakers and wine drinkers is helping Naked
Wines to continue to grow. It can attract talented, independent winemakers who want to
experiment with new ideas, and connect them directly to the end consumer. This is reinforced
by the reviews that people leave on the Naked Wines website, to which winemakers can
respond directly via a specially developed app. ‘We knew that it would be beneficial from a
customer perspective,’ said Laura Riches, former marketing director of Naked Wines, ‘but what
we didn’t realize was that, from a winemaker perspective, they’d never had that type of
feedback before.’
Storytelling Saves the Day
Producers and consumers working and communicating together is delivering multiple benefits
and a highly profitable value proposition. This virtuous circle, as Naked likes to call it, also
includes support for winemakers when tragedies happen. From the fires in Napa Valley to
sabotage in France, the Angels are on hand to offer additional support.
Katie Jones has one such a story. She followed her dream, leaving her nine-to-five job in the
UK to grow grapes in the Languedoc region of France. But when Katie chose to leave the localpage 179
winemaking cooperative, wanting to make her own wine rather than pool her grapes with her
neighbours’ lower-quality ones, things turned sour.
After the 2013 harvest, disgruntled cooperative members broke in to her winery and opened the
taps on the vats. The previous year’s entire vintage of white wine was emptied down the drain
and she was left with absolutely nothing. ‘That’s when we gave her a call,’ said Laura. ‘We’ve
heard about you and heard your story. We want to help.’

Naked then asked its Angels if they would be willing to buy Katie’s next vintage in advance so
that she could afford to continue making wine. Overnight, 30,000 bottles of her wine were
bought by the Angels and she was able to carry on with her dream. ‘This is no marketing
gimmick,’ Riches added. ‘This is someone whose life has been completely transformed.’
There are many stories just like this one, of working together and supporting one another. Great
wines are produced, business dreams are realized, and customers are delighted with new andpage 180
innovative products to suit every palate.
Marketing Secrets of Success: Call in the
Archangels
Storytelling has always been an essential marketing tool and it is a huge asset for Naked,
aiding in its delivery of lifetime value for the business from the Angels. Laura suggests there are
three ways she makes that happen.
1. Activation
Encouraging customers to place an order, and then encouraging them to place another one, so
they’re placing more orders each year. To ensure continued success, Naked needs to stay very
close to its customers, and understand their likes and dislikes. It has a unique way of gathering
this information and responding accordingly.
Recently, the growing community of Angels was looking online for Provence rosé and finding
nothing, the reason being that the available produce did not fit well with Naked’s philosophy of
trendy labels, so there was no such wine on the site. Laura explains how Naked resolved this
marketing problem ‘by involving a special group of customers in the buying process’–Naked
calls them Archangels. These are committed customers who help new angels navigate the
naked.com website as well as being a bellwether for the introduction of new wines. The
Archangels set about their task, sampling 40 different Provence rosés and streaming the whole
event live on Facebook, shared with others in the group. Unsurprisingly, and fitting with the
Naked philosophy, their choice of wine came from a small producer, Bruno Lapierre, whose
wines were not available in the UK.
Naked could now roll out the story to all of its Angels and retail customers, who just buy wine
online that is ready for immediate consumption. As Laura explained, ‘We decided that we’ve got
this momentum, we’ve got this great story, let’s make it happen right now. Within four hours,
they were able to pre-order the wine.’ By the next day, more than 600 pre-orders had been
placed for six-bottle cases of the wine–not bad for an expensive wine. That was in February
2017. Four months later, a total of 11,000 bottles had been sold and reviews from 1,000
customers had given the wine a rating of 92 per cent. Laura went on to say, ‘Although the story
wasn’t about a winemaker [and] wasn’t about the wine itself, bringing customers into that
buying process, and making them part of the story using technology, really helped us maximize
our activation opportunity.’
Naked looks for continual improvement and is working on technology to shorten the customer
sign-up process, introducing QR codes on the different wines to make them easier to find by
scanning the code and then one click through to buy and become an Angel. By continuously
encouraging customer engagement, the outcome is helping to grow customer loyalty and
increase awareness of the Naked Wines brand.
2. Retention‘If we can just retain 1 per cent more of existing UK customers,’ Laura added, ‘that’s 2,000
customers that we don’t have to go out and spend to recruit.’
Retention is the mantra of modern marketing. Focusing solely on customer acquisition is
considered a short-sighted approach as many marketers’ end goal is not just to convert a
consumer into a purchasing customer but to maximize lifetime value by creating loyal
customers. Laura says: ‘The strength of our brand will be in making sure that we keep
customers for as long as we possibly can … we are doing this by harnessing customers and
making them part of a long-term journey with us.’
One way to achieve this is to continually surprise and involve Angels with new projects. For
example, one speculative idea designed to get Angels involved was a start-up scheme to
produce ‘traditional method’ sparkling wine in England. ‘We were asking Angels to take part by
paying nearly £100 in advance for wines they’ll receive in two years’ time, and we couldn’t even
tell them how many bottles of this new wine they’re going to get, because it’s too early in the
process.’
For this idea to work, continued Laura, ‘We needed to get at least 1,000 people to sign up in
order for it to be viable.’ She was delighted with the response: ‘We got over 1,400 Angels
respond almost immediately saying, “Yeah, I want to be involved.’”
From a marketing standpoint, this means multiple opportunities to speak to these customers,
not just about buying more wine, but ‘getting them involved in a conversation about this wine,
and about this story’. In addition, they’ll have personal involvement in the finished product, from
choosing the base blend the sparkling wine is made from, through naming the wine and
designing the label. ‘The engagement has been extraordinary,’ said Laura, reporting that
customers really take ownership of the wine long after they’ve forgotten about spending that
£100. The outcome is that customers and producers have co-created a value that goes way
beyond the actual product they have made and purchased: everyone involved in the project has
had a very rich experience and taken part in the story of the development of a new English
sparkling wine.
3. Profitability
Encouraging customers to buy more per order and to spend a little bit more on a wine that
delivers a little bit more margin. Naked takes a digital-first approach: its website is its store front
and when visitors land on the site it must capture their attention sufficiently to make them
curious to find out more and eventually end up at the checkout.
Naked plays a very long game (perhaps this is due to selling a product range that increases in
value with age) and has invested in making sure that, when it comes to using the website, it
meets the ever increasing expectations of online customers. The digital team at Naked squeeze
value from every online interaction–they even find out on the landing page about the types of
wine customers are interested in buying and their price range. They also use the site’s 6 million
online reviews to increase profitability, applying an algorithm that can match users’ own taste
buds and reviews to those of other similar customers, so they can learn from each other. ‘It’s a
really powerful tool, something we’re constantly evolving and that we hope will be even more
powerful in the future.’ The aim is that, by analysing purchasing behaviour maps, it becomes
possible to develop personally tailored marketing plans that meet the needs of specific
individuals. Naked has more than 90 different segments, which are targeted with different
products, different advertising copy and different customer experiences.
The online reviews help the winemakers too. One such found through the specially developed
Naked Wines app that while its wines received top reviews in the UK, they unfortunately did not
in the US and Australia. This knowledge allowed the producer to adapt its wines slightly topage 181
counter criticism from customers in those two countries and it now receives over 90 per cent
positive ratings from them too.
Covid Raises Challenges
The Covid-19 pandemic was an interesting time for Naked Wines. During that period, the
company’s CFO and managing director, James Crawford, noted a market trend towards online
shopping. In the US, for example, online’s share of the wine market has rocketed from 5 to 20
per cent. There has also been a new source of demand through social channels, which has
yielded a surge in younger audiences, such as people in the 30–35 age group who would
typically spend their non-locked-down free time in bars and restaurants, and who previously
had not really considered the purchase of direct-to-consumer wine.
Weekly ‘Thirsty Toosday’ Zoom tastings
The idea to link winemakers around the world to Angels via Zoom was a roaring success, with
up to 10,000 Angels logging on. One such example was a link-up between Angels and
winemakers from New Zealand, Argentina and France, who discussed the ongoing harvest and
answered many questions. This informed the audience of future productions coming up, while
reinforcing this community of winemakers, customers, the company and, most importantly,
consumers, who naturally drank during the event.
Naked Wines charity
During the pandemic Naked also became more socially conscious. It set up four UK-based
charities to support winemakers struggling outside the community during Covid-19, by buying
their stock and selling it on to the Angels as an additional package. It also identified a lack of
diversity in wine production and set up bursaries for people from minority ethnic backgrounds in
the US and South Africa, to help address this.
Coming out of Covid-19 has seen continued success for Naked, with sales up 80 per cent. The
number of Angels registered globally is approaching 900,000, and they have invested in more
than 225 winemakers. In 2022 Naked was awarded Online Wine Retailer of the Year.
But not all is rosy in the vines. The company’s share price tumbled in 2022. Some of the
reasons behind this were increased costs due to inflation and retention rates falling from 88 to
80 per cent. Consumers were beginning to feel the financial pinch, with higher energy, food and
transport costs. The outlook for 2023 is challenging, but Naked intends to continue to invest in
acquiring new customers.

CHAPTER 5
Value Through Relationships
Learning Outcomes
After reading this chapter, you

arketers are increasingly considering societal as well as economic factors
when developing their strategies, so they can deliver value not only for
customers but also for employees, their families and many other
stakeholders. The benefits derived from a value-driven approach are many. In
this chapter, we examine how value can be created through relationship
marketing.Relationship marketing is a philosophy involving ‘marketing initiatives
being based on relationships, networks and interaction and recognizing that
marketing is embedded in the total management of the networks of the selling
organization, the market and society’ (Gummesson 2002; Berry 2008), and is
common practice in business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business
(B2B) markets (Jones et al. 2015). Hence, developing successful relationships
between buyer and supplier becomes a firm’s ultimate goal, which arguably
can deliver value for all involved.
The principles of relationship marketing are nothing new (McGarry 1953),
but do represent a fundamental change in marketing practice. Since the 1990s,
the shift in marketing research and practice (Grönroos 1994) away from the
Four-Ps, which had dominated marketing thinking since 1960, occurred in
response to growing customer demands and an ever more complex business
environment (Singh et al. 2011). The significance of relationship marketing
has continued to gather momentum as companies have moved away from
developing short-term transactional relationships towards building long-term
relationships (Kotler 1991). At the heart of relationship-building theory is the
idea of value creation by managing customer expectations and experiences
within societal networks, and these ideas have become more developed and
important to business survival in recent years.
In this chapter, we build on earlier discussions of customer value (Chapter
1) to explore relationship marketing and associated management practices.
Throughout the chapter, illustrative examples are provided from both B2B and
B2C contexts. This chapter examines the concepts of value creation,
relationship marketing and relational networks, before considering building
and managing relationships, the benefits of developing organizational and
consumer relationships, developing customer retention strategies, customer
loyalty programmes and customer relationship management (CRM)
systems.
Value Creation
Value creation occurs when firms enter into exchanges with their customers; to
be successful, every area of a firm’s value chain must be dedicated to value
creation (Merz et al. 2018). Merz and colleagues give the example of two fast￾food restaurants in the US: Wendy’s and McDonald’s. Value is co-created atpage 185
Wendy’s when the company provides the dining facilities, prepares the food
and drink, and delivers it to the customer to enjoy. If the customers value this
experience, they may choose to return to Wendy’s rather than go to
McDonald’s. Customers may also share their positive experiences on social
media and reply to an opinion survey. Customers are likely to review their
experiences at Wendy’s and consider these in relation to the positioning shown
in its advertising. This series of interactions is an example of how customers
can help contribute to co-creation of value for a brand. Two further aspects to
consider are customer-owed resources and customer motivation (Merz et al.
2018).
1. Customer-owned resources:
Brand knowledge a customer has acquired. This experience makes them a
valuable resource to the brand (Harmeling et al. 2017), especially if this
knowledge is used to write reviews and blog about their experiences.
Brand skills refers to the customer’s influence over potential customers.
The more informed the customer, the greater the authority with which
they can speak about the brand.
Brand connectedness refers to the customer’s personal links and networks
(Harmeling et al. 2017). Customers who are part of a social media
network can connect, communicate and interact, not only with their own
friends and family but also with the brand and its employees, which might
be able to extend the reach and diversity of the target audience.
2. Customer motivation:
Brand passion is love, and strong feeling, towards a brand (Albert et al.
2013); it is central to the development of strong brand relationships.
Brands can use the customer’s enthusiasm by encouraging word of mouth
(online and offline) to extend reach.
Brand trust refers to customers’ confidence a brand will deliver
on its promises. It is also an important aspect of maintaining
customer relationships.
Brand commitment is defined as the extent to which customers will work
with the brand. A committed customer will help to co-create brand value
through brand communities, positive reviews and even product
development. Booking.com, for instance, relies on the quality of services
provided by the hotels and accommodation advertised on its platform.
Customers using the accommodation-booking platform are activelyencouraged to review places after their trip. The co-creation of value
through customer reviews enables Booking.com, accommodation
suppliers and the end customer to develop strong customer motivation. It
also rewards returning customers with offers, discounts and elevated
booking status (its Genius loyalty programme for frequent travellers).
The co-creation of value through exchange relationships in B2B markets is
important and happens when an arrangement is established between trading
partners. Value is created using the resources and management structures that
the exchange partners control (Hammervoll 2012). Various types of value
creation initiative can be established depending on the extent of the interaction
between the trading partners and the aims for the value creation interaction
(Grönroos and Voima 2012). For example:
Information sharing to aid supplier learning: a buyer might supply market
intelligence about market demand and competitors in a new market to its
supplier to aid learning that might deliver future improvements in the
seller’s offer. In this situation, the success of the interaction is dependent on
the quality of the information provided by the buyer and the supplier’s
ability to use the intelligence effectively (Ciborra 1991).
Supplier development: a supplier improves the quality of its products
through insights derived from discussion and consultation with buyers. In
this case, there is a shared initiative that focuses on improvements that can
contribute to creating a competitive advantage, which will ultimately benefit
both companies. Such initiatives might result in better-quality service
achieved through improved training, reduced costs and more innovative
product design (Hammervoll 2012).
Strategic knowledge sharing: a supplier improves its production processes
by engaging in joint projects with a buyer. Both companies (buyer and
supplier) participate in such ventures by contributing ideas, suggestions and
feedback to gain mutual benefit (Hammervoll 2009). For this level of
interaction to be successful, both parties need to be willing to share sensitive
strategic information, utilize their company’s capabilities and fully engage
in the co-creation of value.
As a result, relationship management plays an essential role in value
creation, because both buyer and supplier need to work together in the pursuit
of mutual gains. Managers in all markets can consider the idea of value
creation, as it may be a way to identify new opportunities to differentiate a
company’s offer. To benefit, managers should allocate time and resources topage 186
learning about their customers’ requirements, and then considering how to
improve their products and services. In consumer markets, service providers
need to demonstrate their commitment, not only towards their customers, but
also towards employees, suppliers and other stakeholders, to create trusting
relationships and excellent customer experiences. For example, the coffee shop
sector has focused on how to create customer experiences that matter. See
Marketing in Action 5.1 for a discussion of how Starbucks created the ‘third
place’ concept and in doing so revolutionized the coffee shop industry.
MARKETING IN ACTION 5.1
The Third Place: Creating and Managing Customer
Value in the Coffee Shop Industry
Howard Schultz joined Starbucks when it had just four coffee shops. Then he went on a trip
to Italy and came back to the US with an idea that would change coffee-drinking behaviour
and stimulate the development of a multi-billion-dollar industry. Schultz wanted to give
Americans the Italian coffee experience, but realized he needed to adapt the product and
service offer to suit the needs of his customers, as they would not want the strong, bitter
espresso coffee drunk by Italians. So he invented a version of coffee to entice young adults
away from sugary drinks like Coke and sought to change their beverage￾drinking behaviour. He added milk and sugary syrups to strong black coffee, so
his customers could get their caffeine ‘kick’ in a different way. Schultz encouraged people to
drink frothy cappuccinos and milky lattés, and their response was overwhelming: they
queued in their hundreds outside the company’s coffee shops in Seattle.Source: Michael Gordon/Shutterstock
Adapting the product was only part of Schultz’s strategy; he also realized the importance to
customers of creating a unique environment in which to experience their coffee drinking.
With this in mind, Schultz conceived the ‘third place’ – a place between work and home, a
place to meet friends. Starbucks’ coffee shops were designed to provide a warm and
convivial atmosphere to appeal to customers, a principle that has remained important to the
company throughout its development into a global mega-brand. The third place idea was so
successful it became a model used by many of the world’s successful coffee shop brands,
such as Costa Coffee and Caffè Nero.
Each Starbucks store is designed to be as unique as possible, even though the company
operates more than 22,000 stores globally. But, as well as the look and feel, distinct zones
within many stores aim to provide different customer experiences. For example, seating by
windows that allow customers to watch passers-by are aimed at those sipping macchiatos;
stylish bars that allow customers to stand while they drink frothy espressos aim to create an
experience reminiscent of traditional coffee houses in Italy; communal tables, for groups of
customers or individuals, provide space to drink, eat, socialize, read or work on a laptop;
while softer seating areas offer more ‘intimate’ coffee-drinking experiences. During and after
the Covid-19 pandemic, Starbucks’ commitment to the third-place concept grew, realizing as
it did the value of providing customers with safe and convenient service experiences.
Another initiative added during this period was the drive-through, giving customers a
contactless way to order via mobile app, enabling them to ‘grab and go’, as well as voice
ordering with Apple’s Siri, further streamlining the ordering process.
At the heart of Starbucks’ success is a set of core principles that focus on value creation,
the development of relational capital and the capture of customer value. Relationships with
customers, employees, suppliers and alliance partners are considered so valuable they
form a central part of the company’s activities.
For customers, it is important to understand the service operation from the perspective of
the person the service exists for, so Starbucks works with its customers to get ideas on howpage 187
to improve its service. For example, the My Starbucks Idea website (now retired) invited
customers to submit ideas and suggestions. Many new product ideas and service
improvements have been introduced by following up on customer ideas – for example, ‘buy
10 get one free’, reduced-fat cinnamon swirl coffee cake, Evolution Fresh (fruit and veg)
smoothies and Teavana premium loose-leaf tea. At the Tryer Center, Starbucks’ innovation
lab, new designs are tested, and many product and service innovations and
recipes have resulted. This centre allowed operational and design teams to
respond quickly during the pandemic, as new store layouts and processes were developed,
tested and launched in-store very quickly.
For employees, learning is an important part of the value creation process at Starbucks. For
example, Starbucks and the Schultz Family Foundation work with disengaged young adults
to help them find employment; they also provide job training programmes and life skills
coaching to support young people throughout their lives, not only at work. Mutual benefits
are generated: for the company, happier and more satisfied employees mean genuine good
service experiences for Starbucks customers, and for the individual, there is a sense of
purpose and belonging.
For suppliers and alliance partners, supplier development and knowledge-sharing for
strategic development is vital to the company’s ongoing success. Starbucks works with its
suppliers and farmers to ensure its coffee beans are grown in a sustainable manner, for
example by adhering to the Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E.) Practices; this not only
provides high-quality beans but also ensures the livelihoods of the farmers and their
families.

Value and Relational Networks
Value and relational networks involve people and the roles they play within the
networks, and the processes of relationship building and cooperation (Prahalad
and Ramaswamy 2000). ‘Network’ is a term used to describe a set of
connections among people, which from a marketing perspective might be used
as a resource to solve problems, share knowledge and extend the network by
adding new connections (Wenger et al. 2011). Networks are highly complex
and intangible entities, but are formed to co-produce service offerings,
exchange service offerings and facilitate the co-creation of value (Lusch et al.
2010). LinkedIn is an example of an online network that connects professional
workers together.
However, it is important to note the roles people assume within a network
can be highly complex and an individual may assume different identities in
social situations (Edvardsson et al. 2011). For example, a software company
may be made up of several individuals who play various roles (e.g. leader,page 188
problem-solver, designer, service provider). A role within a value network is
different from a job title. So, at the software company, the leader may have the
job title, senior developer, but may also act as a problem-solver.
A network relationship should facilitate the sharing of competencies and
aid the development of relationships, to enable companies to perform better
(Lusch et al. 2010). For example, eBay is an electronic marketplace made up
of buyers and sellers that has created new opportunities for different types of
seller (hobbyists and collectors) who previously did not have access to a
commercial platform. As eBay has grown, so have the connections and number
of buyers and sellers that use the marketplace. Working together, eBay and its
participants have created a highly successful value network that is clearly
differentiated from its competitors.
Relationship building, value creation and cooperation involve many
people, including customers, in the designing of processes and services that
add value. Bringing in the customers opens opportunities to create new closer
relationships by learning and developing greater understanding of their needs
and wants, and then meeting these with innovative marketing practices as part
of a dynamic feedback loop (Madhavaram and Hunt 2017). The feedback is
important, as it enable marketers to develop greater sensitivity, more intimate
knowledge and cooperation towards customers when planning promotions, and
designing products and services, which ultimately adds value and builds
competitive resistance (Sánchez-Gutiérrez 2019). This new level of
understanding can be of great strategic value but requires senior management
and organizational commitment if value creation is to become a strategic
marketing management capability.
Having explored some of the foundations of value and relational networks,
relationship building and cooperation, the next section considers the core
concepts of relationship marketing, followed by discussion of managerial
issues and the practical implications of adopting a relationship marketing
approach.
As discussed earlier, service quality, trust and commitment feature strongly
in the creation of satisfaction between parties in the relationship. Read Mini
Case 5.1 to find out more about how to engage millennials in a meaningful
relationship.MINI CASE 5.1
Millennials: A Booming Generation of Consumers
Millennials are a maturing generation born in the period from around 1980 to 2000. They
are a different breed of consumer, having grown up with digital media, and are experts in
the use of the internet, social media and mobile technology to facilitate every aspect of their
lives. Across the world, from the US to China, the two-billion-strong millennial generation
has come of age, and is overtaking Generation X and the baby boomers in terms of
spending power.
Previously, millennials have been portrayed in mainstream media as ‘lazy, debt-laden,
social-media obsessed fame seekers’, yet they have now become a generation most
wanted by brands (Barton et al. 2012) and are making their preferences felt during
purchase decisions. They are setting down roots, buying houses, growing their families and
exploring how things can be done differently, both personally and in terms of the products
and services they buy. For example, their selection of alternative modes of travel and
reduced car ownership reflects their changing lifestyles, beliefs and aspirations.
There is little doubt marketers must think and act differently to build relationships with this
generation, who are adept at using technology as part of their daily lives. According to
Simonson and Rosen (2014), ‘In the past, buyers typically made relative comparisons (“Is
Brand A better than Brand B?”) or went by the maxim “You get what you pay for”.’ Buyers
largely had to rely on information provided by suppliers, media reports and word of mouth
from personal friends and acquaintances who had personal experience of a brand. Digital
media channels – especially social media channels – have opened up opportunities for
smaller independent brands to reach out to this generation of web-savvy consumers, who
are more prepared to experiment than were previous generations.
Millennials are very active when it comes to consulting social media for information about
physical products, brand experiences and service quality, to inform their purchasing
decisions. Social media provides an increasingly rich tapestry of reviews of customer
experiences. They are also keen to use and provide peer-to-peer reviews on products and
services, giving potential buyers the opportunity to get a sense of what it’s like to own or use
the goods they’re considering and enabling edgier brands (e.g. Urban Decay) to gain a
foothold.
In 2018, it was predicted that global millennial spending power would overtake that of Gen X
by 2020 and then continue to rise (see table).
Source: based on data from World Data Labpage 189
Brands, marketers and start-up businesses need to recognize the following differences
when targeting millennials:
Desires: this generation wants more from the brands they choose to engage with; they
are keen to co-create by sharing opinions, reviews and feedback through social media
and the web. They will endorse the things they approve of, but shout about things they
despise. They are also happy to engage in such activities around the clock and tend to
react instantaneously. The implications for marketers are brands do not have to wait to
poll opinions about a new product launch; they can accurately gauge consumer
reactions almost instantly online. But brands must ensure authenticity and transparency
if they wish to avoid the wrath of a millennial backlash to a product offer perceived to be
‘phoney’ or unfair.
Demands: experiences are important, as are new and innovative products and services.
While rational functionality is key, as a millennial is likely to be the ‘chief technology
officer’ in many households, they also like emotional rewards and instant gratification,
which must be delivered appropriately and quickly. Pleasure, fun and adventure are also
cravings of this generation, who are prepared to do things differently, from
ordering an instant taxi (Uber) and staying in someone else’s home instead
of using a recognized accommodation provider (Airbnb), to having a personal shopper
manage their luxury clothing online orders (Net-a-Porter).
Influencers: millennials’ lives are directly interconnected with others and so are heavily
affected by the views of their peers. Their purchasing behaviour is strongly influenced by
their large network of online ‘friends’ and, unlike previous generations, they turn more
readily to online peer networks for advice and ideas, which they openly share online.
So what are the new rules for marketers wishing to develop relational networks with
millennials?
The rules of millennial relational network-building
1. Do not stereotype: millennials have been referred to as lazy, entitled and spoiled, but
this does not fit well with their own ideals.
2. Understand the target customer profile: broadly, this generation are tech-savvy digital
natives, relaxed, in love with convenience, want things easy and have a strong sense of
self. But their birthdays span 20 years, so there are subsegments to consider.
3. Engage through digital media: millennials are prepared to become brand advocates and
co-create, but an engagement strategy needs to be interesting and thought-provoking if
it is not to be dismissed by this generation.
4. Plan to reward your customers: be able to provide instant and appropriate rewards.
5. Do not try to hide mistakes: seek millennials’ ‘expert advice’ when things are going right,
but also when things go wrong.
6. Make it fun: this is a constantly on-the-go generation and they want new experiences to

Key Concepts of Relationship
Marketing
The term ‘relationship marketing’ was coined by Berry and colleagues (1983),
who defined it in terms of the marketing strategies that companies need to
apply to retain customers over a longer time. This new paradigm redefined
marketing, moving it away from being a transactional exchange process and
towards a relational perspective. This also led to greater understanding of the
lifetime value of a customer and the potential value of strategic partnering
(Sheth 2017). Much of the logic that underpins the core elements of
relationship marketing comes from the marketing of services rather than
physical products. But there is debate about the meaning of relationship
marketing: for some it means customer relationship management (CRM),
while to others it is the marketing activities a firm engages in after an
exchange has occurred (e.g. loyalty programmes) and is considered more as
customer support (Sheth 2017). We’ll return to this issue later, when discussing
relationship management. Nevertheless, there are two important elements of
relationship marketing to consider:
1. Core service: a core service can be developed around a company’s offer that
meets customers’ needs in a distinctive manner. Retail banks have developed
tailored financial products that enable customers to choose the level of
service wrapped around their personal bank account. For example, HSBC
plc offers a Basic Account, Student Account, Advanced Account and
Premier Account.
2. Relationship quality: customers develop relationships with
companies by engaging in the exchange process, and are motivated
to do so by the potential value that might be gained. But, from a relationship
marketing perspective, the ongoing interaction between parties is of primaryimportance. In other words, companies seek to build relationships that
develop customer loyalty and, in doing so, encourage customers to engage
in repeated purchasing. Ultimately, the quality of a relationship is likely to
affect customer loyalty and determine whether a company can retain its
customers (Vize et al. 2013).
Relationship quality is a complex subject, but there are several key factors
to consider (Vize 2012) that will potentially affect the outcome of a
relationship:
Service quality: this involves the experience a customer has of a company’s
offer. Services vary in complexity, and in the investment and risk a customer
makes in the purchase (e.g. having a haircut or buying a cup of coffee).
Service quality is discussed in detail in Chapter 11, but it is important to
note service quality plays an important part in the development of
relationships, especially in service industries (Chenet et al. 2010). Read

agents.
Trust: this refers to a customer’s level of confidence in a company’s ability
to supply the required goods, and its reliability and integrity (Hunt et al.
1994). Trust is developed over time as customers base their perceptions and
expectations on past purchase experiences. Trust plays a very important role
in relationships, especially in an online setting. Building trust is a very
effective way to increase satisfaction and subsequently develop commitment
to long-term relationships (Hunt et al. 1994; Geyskens et al. 1998; Selnes
1998; Vlaga and Eggert 2006). It can also help weaker partners in a business
relationship to gain power over time in their dealings with more powerful
companies (Narayandas and Rangan 2004). As a relationship develops, a
customer may at the same time develop positive feelings about a company
as they come to rely on the credibility of a brand and the competency with
which the goods and services are provided. When customers trust a brand,
they are more likely to recommend it to others and also to continue to use
the brand themselves (Adams 2014).
Commitment: this involves the extent to which customers seek to develop an
enduring relationship with a company (Moorman et al. 1992) and is likely to
affect their loyalty to a company. Commitment is a driver of loyalty, as
some of the benefits of a committed relationship are reduced uncertainty,
greater satisfaction and enhanced performance, through the synergies of an
effective relationship. There are different types of commitment. Some
customers can form emotional attachments to a brand, and this forms thebasis of their commitment to it. For example, when food manufacturer
Heinz used the slogan ‘Beanz Meanz Heinz’ to promote its baked beans in
1967, little did it realize this would become one of the most enduring and
long-lasting advertising slogans of all time (Gerges 2012), arguably so much
so that when the manufacturer wanted to give the brand a more relevant and
up-to-date feel, the iconic slogan changed to ‘Beanz Meanz More’, keeping
in touch with committed loyal customers of the brand for whom the original
slogan acts as a mantra, while reaching out to new generations with whom
Heinz is ‘developing conversations’ (Pham 2021a) (see Exhibit 5.1).
Other customers base their commitment on more rational calculations: for
example, some mobile phone companies offer contracts that bundle together
benefits, including handsets and internet and telephone services, which
provide an overall discount.
Satisfaction: customers are likely to reflect on their experiences and
evaluate the extent to which their choice has generated the results they
wanted. There are many influences that might determine a customer’s level
of satisfaction, for example level of knowledge, prior experience, economic
requirements and social influences (Geyskens et al. 1999).

Digital Genius: Customer Service on Auto Pilot
Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the customer service industry. Responding to routine
customer enquiries is now regularly done through digital interfaces (e.g. live chat). But these
services are increasingly becoming automated, and conversational (software) agents (CAs),
or chatbots, are replacing customer service staff. AI systems are able to respond using
natural language.page 191
Source: Paul Craft/Shutterstock
Advantages and cost saving are on offer when using AI in a customer service role: more
customer enquiries can be dealt with faster, and working 24 hours a day there is no
appreciable downtime with CAs (e.g. for staff illness, training or away days). Challenges do
exist, such as how to balance self-service efficiency with quality of service; how good are
CAs at selling – are sales being lost as CAs are not yet able to empathize with the
customer, overcome objections and persuade customers to make a purchase? But AI and
CAs are constantly evolving; more human characteristics are being developed and it is
envisaged that, in the future, customers will attribute more and more human-like qualities to
the technological replacements.
Digital Genius, founded in 2013, is a multilingual, multichannel, AI-automated customer
service.
How it works
The platform brings together e-commerce solutions with a customer service interface driven
by AI. When a customer message enters the system, it is analysed and the AI agent then
predicts accurate suggestions and automated responses. Systems are built using real-life
knowledge of customer service encounters, to enable firms to respond with automated and
fully integrated services for trade customers.
Digital Genius works with a growing network of companies and industries, such as KLM
(airline), Snipes (shoe retailer) Skull Candy (tech products), Quicksilver (clothing) and
Packlink (logistics)., to resolve their customer service challenges. For example, Swiss
athletic shoe firm On offered medical workers 50 per cent promotions during the Covid-19
pandemic as a gesture of support, and the campaign went viral. While the uplift in sales was
welcome, the new types of customers (healthcare workers instead of runners) gave the
shoe brand a new set of customer service challenges – especially as the number of
enquiries increased by more than 3,200 per cent. Digital Genius came to the rescue, putting
together an automated system that could handle more than 40,000 enquiries. By integrating
order, logistics, returns and complaint systems with CRM systems, more than 90 per cent of
enquiries could be dealt with automatically.
The Perfume Shop, a UK retailer of branded fragrances, set up an online support channel
which it wanted to be an efficient, automated service, so turned to Digital Genius for a
solution. This enabled 97 per cent of first-contact responses to be handled bypage 192
the new system. This also enabled human customer service representatives to handle more
complex and difficult enquiries, which boosted customer satisfaction ratings for the retailer.
Service differentiation
Digital Genius is doing things differently in order to stand out in an increasingly competitive
marketplace. The firm positions itself as providing better customer services, increased
quality and efficiency of customer conversations across digital channels using text-based
communication channels like email, chat, social media and mobile messaging, enabling
companies to scale up customer service operations and exceed rising customer
expectations.
By using the services of Digital Genius, firms can enjoy having no backlogs of customer
enquiries, quick customer problem resolution and tailored customer interaction journeys,
enabling the Digital Genius CAs to better meet customer service expectations.

From a buyer’s (business and consumer) point of view, the proliferation of
choice and the development of the online marketplace has made moving
between competitors easier than ever before. When customers are faced with
many alternatives while making purchasing decisions, they can switch between
suppliers (Singh et al. 2011), so the greater the number of suppliers and the
larger the product choice, the easier it becomes to change. Mobile phoneoperators use this knowledge and often develop relational price incentives
(Berry 2008) to encourage customers to move to a new network operator.
European phone carrier EE, for example, includes unlimited calls, inclusive
cloud storage, free music, data rollover and a bundle of other services to retain
and attract new customers. In this dynamic marketing environment, it becomes
increasingly important for companies to seek ways to develop lasting
relationships with their customers. In response to these changes, companies
have begun to focus on how to develop long-term relationships.
Relationship Management and
Managing Customer Relationships
Relationships can take different forms and achieve different levels of success
for all parties concerned. At a very basic level, buyers and suppliers can
engage in simple transactional relationships that centre on a single purchase,
and neither party makes contact again after a sale is completed. For example, a
business passenger at an international airport who needs road transportation
will probably never meet the taxi driver again, and the choice of taxi supplier
depends on the passenger’s position in the queue rather than free choice. In
this case, the exchange – cash for the journey – is a pure transaction; the driver
knows it is unlikely there will ever be a repeat purchase (Egan 1997; see also
Coviello et al. 2002).
Nowadays, this limited level of involvement is rare, most firms look for
opportunities to begin to build a relationship. Uber’s ride-sharing service took
relationship management and loyalty-building to a different level when it
introduced a programme called Momentum, which saw drivers (not
passengers) incentivized with rewards like free MOTs, discounts on servicing
for their vehicles and deals on hot drinks, when they completed 250 passenger
trips. The aim was to encourage drivers to build good relationships with their
passengers and in doing so grow the Uber brand in Europe (Vizard 2015).
To build relationships, a firm should develop detailed understanding of the
purchase experience in order to determine whether the customer expectation
has been met. Online sellers like Amazon and Ebuyer send post-purchase
surveys to poll customers’ views and seek customers’ reviews of the products
and service. The more a seller commits to the notion of a relationship with itspage 193
customers (in both business and consumer markets), the more inclined it is
towards being proactive about the development of the relationship.
Ultimately, at the most engaged level of relationship building, buyer and
supplier develop a partnership approach, and this results in working together
for mutual benefit (McDaniel 1998). Therefore, the nature of the relationship
can increase the complexity of the task of managing relationships. No longer is
it enough just to focus on the transactional element of a sale. New approaches
are needed that move on from market-mix-based solutions towards those built
on relationship development and the specific types of relationship (Harker and
Egan 2010).
Managing relationships is a key ingredient in successful organizational
marketing. In practical terms, relationship marketing concerns the shift from
activities focusing on attracting customers to activities concerned with current
customers and how to retain them. Customer retention is critical, since small
changes in retention rates have significant effects on future revenues
(Andreassen 1995). At its core is the maintenance of relations between a
company and its suppliers, channel intermediaries, the public and its
customers.
Ultimately, the key idea is for companies to act to create customer loyalty
so a stable, mutually profitable and long-term relationship is developed
(Ravald and Grönroos 1996). Furthermore, loyal customers are likely to spend
more than non-loyal customers and recommend a company to others. So, for
relationship marketing to be successful, two essential conditions should be
met:
1. A relationship should be a mutually rewarding connection between two or
more parties.
2. The parties involved in the relationship should commit to the relationship
over time and be willing to make adaptations to their own behaviour to
maintain its continuity (Takala and Uusitalo 1996).
Relationship marketing in services has attracted much attention in recent
years as organizations focus their efforts on retaining existing customers rather
than just attracting new ones. It is not a new concept, however,
since the idea of a company earning customer loyalty was well
known to the earliest merchants, who had the following saying: ‘As a
merchant, you’d better have a friend in every town’ (Grönroos 1994). From a
marketing viewpoint, it is important to recognize relationship marketing
involves shifting away from activities concerned with attracting customerstowards activities that focus on current customers, and how to retain them and
convert them into loyal advocates of the brand (and/or company). Although the
idea of relationship marketing can be applied to many industries, it is
particularly important in services, where there is often direct contact between
service provider and customer – for example, the client–agency relationship in
the advertising industry, the relationship between a web service provider and
its clients, and that between hotel staff and guests. See Marketing in Action 5.2
for further discussion of building communities in the web service industry.

Most Valued People Award Helps Drive Umbraco’s
Success
Technology readiness is vital to a firm’s success as it can increase customer satisfaction
and improve service quality, which together strengthen competitive advantage. Umbraco is
an open-source content management system (CMS) offering solutions across industry to
increase technology readiness. The CMS has an important role in the increasingly complex
online world, where a website has become an essential part of a company’s marketing
presence. Additionally, most companies now have a website with links to social media
platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and operational processing systems like
ordering, logistics tracking and customer services. The result is more complex websites
needing effective management of all the content, transactional elements and digital media
channels to achieve market goals.
Source: Umbraco
Umbraco offers solutions created by Niels Hartvig, who developed a simple CMS framework
at his first job at Snabel & Co in Denmark. From here, Niels developed a prototype, which
was released in 2003. This proved to be very popular and has become widely adopted by
leading retail brands, telecommunications companies, financial institutions, government and
other public-sector organizations, and others.page 194
One contribution to Umbraco’s success is it was launched as an open-source project – a
method widely used in the software development industry to enable open access to
products via a free licence, which enables and promotes collaboration.
One firm to benefit from innovative CMS system solutions is Niska Ice Cream, based in
Melbourne, Australia, which used Umbraco’s CMS to power a point-of-sale system that
enabled robots to run ice cream kiosks without human intervention. A robot presents a
touchscreen (see above image), the customer selects their ice cream and any additional
toppings, then the robot makes the ice cream, which is deposited into a chilled service
counter, where the customer can retrieve their dessert by presenting their receipt. The
product choices are managed by the CMS system running in the background, which also
enables the introduction of marketing promotions. Niska is expanding its unattended ice
cream kiosks to other countries and is driving the growth of utilizing innovative technologies
to solve real-world problems.
Another contributing factor was Umbraco’s Most Valued People (MVP) award, which not
only served to reward excellence in the software development community, but also to build
a strong collaborative community of like-minded individuals. What makes Umbraco’s MVP
award unique is nominations from amateurs and professionals alike are welcomed. The
value of this approach is the community can be expanded but, at the same time, Umbraco
ensures the project remains grounded and relevant to everyone’s needs. The Umbraco
community is quoted as being ‘the friendliest CMS community on the planet’ and is a great
example of collaborative working on a global scale. Umbraco currently ensures the smooth
running of hundreds of thousands of major websites worldwide, and the community of
skilled professionals and partners who ensure Umbraco stays relevant and up to date
numbers around 200,000 members.
Technology readiness underpins satisfaction and service quality for tech firms
Based on: Vize et al. (2013); Umbraco (2018, 2022); Niska (2022)
The quality of the relationship is likely to determine the length of a
relationship, levels of satisfaction and loyalty. Companies therefore need to
decide when the practice of relationship marketing is most applicable. The
following conditions suggest potential areas for the use of relationship
marketing activities (Berry 1995a):where there is an ongoing or periodic desire for the service on the part of the
customer (e.g. insurance, banking, telephone, internet services)
where the customer controls the selection of a service provider (e.g.
selecting a hotel, a beautician, a restaurant, an entertainment provider, an
airline).
There are situations where the supplier may have few competitors, and in
these circumstances may feel it is less important to develop strong customer
relationships (e.g. utility providers such as gas, water and electricity
companies, and health services). But these markets are changing; in energy
markets there are new providers, in healthcare private hospitals, alternative
healthcare providers are emerging and the competition is increasing,
furthermore traditional suppliers do not always hold the power (in the way
they used to) and it has become easier, more affordable and therefore more
viable for customers to switch suppliers. Moneysupermarket.com, for instance,
is an online brand developed to help consumers save money by switching to
alternative providers.
We will now explore how to build a relationship and then the benefits of
relationship marketing to organizations and customers, and the customer
retention strategies used to build relationships and tie customers closer to
companies.
How to Build Relationships
Once marketers decide where to invest resources into building a relationship,
they consider the degree of effort to put in to relationship building. In most
exchange relationships, there is some potential benefit to be gained from
relationship development; Sheth (2017) argues emphasis should be placed on
managing ‘share of heart’ rather than ‘share of wallet’, and also that
relationship marketing practices such as loyalty programmes, key account
management and customer relationship management schemes have become
universal and therefore commoditized. His solution is to focus on winning
‘share of heart’, which involves close bonding with customers in much the
same way as you would develop a relationship with a friend.
The section on value creation highlighted some of the important features of
close partnership relationships, how parties engaged in relationship
development adapt their processes and products to achieve a better match withpage 195
each other, and how they share information and experience, which reduces
insecurity and uncertainty.
Sharing information is a good starting point for the development of a close,
connected relationship and many firms are using digital channels to encourage
their customers to share information. For example, John Deere, business-to￾business supplier of agricultural machinery, uses social media sites (e.g.
Facebook and Twitter) to communicate with farmers with similar interests
around the world.
Effective relationship building can create opportunities to develop
competitive advantage and is especially powerful if embedded within the
culture of the organization, which makes it more difficult for competitors to
copy (Winklhofer et al. 2006). Exchanging information is potentially a low￾level approach to relationship building, so to create a more involved,
relationship-orientated culture a company needs to identify aspects of its
business that could be considered part of a relationship-building strategy.
There are several potential sources a firm might consider.
Technical support
Technical support can take the form of research and development cooperation,
before-sales or after-sales service, and providing training to the customer’s
staff. The supplier is thus enhancing the customer’s know-how and
productivity. Such exchanges between organizations help firms to extract
better value from the products and services they buy as the technical support
acts as an addition to a purchase and provides a type of guarantee the buyer
will be able to garner best value from its purchases. Technical support can be
further embellished by adding repair services and third-party complaint
handling. This in turn helps to build trust and loyalty, and to improve retention
rates (Paparoidamis et al. 2019) for all types of firms. However, when things
fail to go according to plan, customers can become dissatisfied and lose faith
in a brand.
For example, electronics retailer Currys PC World had built up a good
reputation for its technical support, but during the pandemic, hundreds of
customers complained about faulty goods and appliances, and being left
without repairs, replacements or refunds. The retailer sometimes referredcomplaints back to the manufacturers, but even this arrangement failed to
resolve many problems. Customers were left with missing products, and
extended delivery dates, which added to their dissatisfaction (Downes 2020).
Despite the complaints and customer disappointments, the retailer continues to
grow but has recognized the importance of market positioning and so, post￾Covid, has rebranded to Currys, bringing all of its other brands – service
partner Team Knowhow, Carphone Warehouse, PC World and Dixons – under
the one name. With this repositioning has come a streamlining of pricing
models, and simplified services giving greater ‘strategic clarity’ (Pham 2021b).
Expertise
Suppliers can look for opportunities to provide expertise for their customers,
enabling them to improve their service quality. The customer can benefit
through acquiring extra skills at a minimal cost, the benefits of which they can
pass on to their own customers.
For example, French cosmetics and beauty company L’Oréal Professionnel
(Paris) develops specialist haircare products for salons and beauty specialist
businesses. This business-to-business division provides specialist training for
stylists and salon owners, and shares the expertise it has built up over years of
researching and developing new haircare products. L’Oréal has an extensive
range of educational programmes it offers to its customers, from learning how
to apply new haircare products to how to build and run a successful business in
the beauty industry (see Exhibit 5.2).

Resource support
Suppliers can support the resource base of customers, for example by
extending credit facilities, giving low-interest loans, agreeing to cooperative
promotion and accepting reciprocal buying practices, where the supplier agrees
to buy goods from the customer. The overall effect of these activities is a
reduced financial burden for the customer.
Service levels
Suppliers can improve relationships with customers by improving the level of
service offered. This can involve providing more reliable delivery, fast or just￾in-time delivery, setting up computerized reorder systems, offering fast,
accurate quotes and reducing defect levels. In so doing, the customer gains by
lower inventory costs, smoother production runs and lower warranty costs.
Advances in technology are providing opportunities to improve service levels.
For example, BMW is using IBM’s big data analytics technology to improve
its repair and maintenance services, road safety and performance
efficiency of vehicles. IBM’s predictive analytics can detect and fix
potentially faulty elements of new cars, and BMW and IBM are working on
ways to personalize in-car computing and driver support systems using IBM
cloud computing and wireless local area networks (IBM 2022) (see Exhibit
5.3).EXHIBIT 5.3

Risk reduction
If a company is looking to acquire new customers, it may encounter resistance,
as target customers are familiar with their existing suppliers. So, to use risk
reduction as part of a relationship-building strategy, a company should identify
initiatives that enable it to show there are low levels of risk in switching
suppliers. This may involve free demonstrations, the offer of products for trial
at zero or low cost to the customer, product and delivery guarantees,
preventative maintenance contracts, swift complaint handling and proactive
follow-ups. These activities are designed to provide customers with
reassurance. Birds Eye, a European manufacturer of frozen foods, launched a
new range of pasta and rice dishes called Stir Your Senses. To launch the
product range, it ran a ‘try me for free’ campaign, giving away 1.6 million
packs through leading UK supermarkets (IPM 2015). Additionally, this
product range has been developed by working with consumers to understand
how the frozen food manufacturer can best cater for the changing needs of its
customers. These products were developed to provide a hassle-free meal
solution for busy consumers.
Benefits for the OrganizationUltimately, building a successful relationship can bring a range of benefits to
both the supplier and the buyer. Social exchange theory (SET) draws our
attention to the expectation of gaining value, economic gains and social
benefits involved in an exchange relationship, which can be tangible or
intangible (Zhang et al. 2020), and were introduced by Homans (1958) as a
way of understanding power-dependent relationships. Today, social exchange
relies on self-interest by maximizing benefits at minimum cost, and
relationships develop around mutual interests between buyer and supplier both
offline and online (Wu et al. 2014). Online firms should ensure they build
strong trusting relationships with customers, to overcome the absence of face￾to-face interactions.
Crucially, however, it is an evaluation of the balance between perceived
costs and benefits that will determine the duration of a relationship. As
relationships develop, a history of knowledge of past experiences builds up
and, if all is favourable, trust and commitment will grow between parties in the
exchange process (Dwyer et al. 1981) and, in this context, reciprocal value
exists. The nature of the value is likely to be dependent on the context of the
exchange and the benefits sought. Let’s examine possible benefits for
organizations and then consumers.
There are six major benefits for firms from developing and maintaining
strong customer relationships (Zeithaml et al. 2005):
1. Increased purchases: help to develop trust between the company and the
customer as they become more and more satisfied with the quality of
services provided by the supplier.
2. Lower cost: the start-up costs associated with attracting new customers are
likely to be far higher than the cost of retaining existing customers. Start-up
costs include the time spent making repeat calls in an effort to persuade a
prospect to open an account, the advertising and promotional costs
associated with making prospects aware of the company and its service
offering, the operating costs of setting up accounts and systems, and the
time costs of establishing bonds between supplier and customer in the early
stages of the relationship. Furthermore, costs associated with solving initial
teething problems and queries are likely to fall as the customer becomes
accustomed to using the service.
3. Lifetime value of a customer: the lifetime value of a customer is the profit
made on a customer’s purchases over the lifetime of that customer. If, for
example, a customer spends £80 in a supermarket per week, resulting in £8page 197
profit, and uses the supermarket 45 times a year over 30 years, the lifetime
value of that customer is £10,800. Thus, a bad service experience
early on in this relationship, which results in the customer
defecting to the competition, would be very expensive to the supermarket,
especially when the costs of bad word of mouth are added, as this may deter
other customers from using the store.
4. Sustainable competitive advantage: the intangible aspects of a relationship
are not easily copied by the competition. For example, the friendships and
high levels of trust that can develop as a relationship matures can be
extremely difficult for competitors to replicate. This means extra value to
customers derived from the relationship can be a source of sustainable
competitive advantage for suppliers (Roberts et al. 2003).
5. Word of mouth: word of mouth is very important in services due to their
intangible nature, which makes them difficult to evaluate prior to purchase.
In these circumstances, potential purchasers often look to others who have
experienced the service (e.g. a hotel, financial service) for personal
recommendation. A company with a large number of loyal customers is
more likely to benefit from word of mouth than one without such a resource.
6. Employee satisfaction and retention: satisfied, loyal customers benefit
employees in providing a set of mutually beneficial relationships and less
hassle. This enhances employees’ job satisfaction and lowers job turnover.
Employees can spend time improving existing relationships rather than
desperately seeking new customers. This sets up a virtuous circle of satisfied
customers leading to happy employees, which raises customer satisfaction
even higher.
The net result of these six benefits of developing customer relationships is
high profits. The reasons loyal customers generate more revenue for longer,
and the costs of maintaining existing customers are lower, is due to the high
costs associated with acquiring new customers. Moreover, the longer a
customer stays with a service provider, the lower the defection rate (switching
to another provider) and the more likely a customer is to have lower resistance
to price increases, although this must be carefully managed by ensuring
appropriate pricing, especially when introducing new product and service
offers. Older customers are also more inclined to stay with a brand, so when
changing prices that target younger customers, extra care should be taken and
more communication provided on added value help to lower the defection rate
(Somosi et al. 2021).Benefits for the Customer
Entering a long-term relationship can also afford the following four benefits to
the customer:
1. Risk and stress reduction: the intangible nature of services makes them
difficult to evaluate before purchase, which means relationship marketing
can benefit the customer as well as the firm, especially when services are
personally important, variable in quality, complex and/or subject to high￾involvement buying (Berry 1995b). High-risk purchases elevate the
significance of making the wrong choice and the possibility of negative
consequences for the buyer. Banking, insurance, motor servicing and
hairstyling are examples of services exhibiting some or all of the
characteristics – importance, variability, complexity, high involvement – that
would cause many customers to seek an ongoing relationship with a trusted
service provider. The relationship reduces consumer stress, as it becomes
predictable, initial problems are solved, special needs are accommodated
and the consumer learns what to expect. After a period, the consumer begins
to trust the service provider, can count on a consistent level of quality
service and feels comfortable in the relationship (Bitner 1995).
2. Higher-quality service: experiencing a long-term relationship with a service
provider can also result in higher levels of service; the service provider
becomes knowledgeable about the customer’s requirements. For example,
banks, insurers, and health and beauty service providers learn about the
preferences of their clients and how to improve the service offer. Knowledge
of the customer built up over a series of service encounters facilitates the
tailoring or customizing of the service to each customer’s special needs.
3. Avoidance of switching costs: maintaining a relationship with a service
supplier avoids the costs associated with switching to a new provider. Once
a service provider knows a customer’s preferences and special needs, and
has tailored services to suit them, to change would mean educating a new
provider and accepting the possibility of mistakes being made until the new
provider has learned to accommodate them, resulting in both time and
psychological costs to the customer.
4. Social and status benefits: customers can also reap social and status benefits
from a continuing relationship with a supplier. Since many service
encounters are also social encounters, repeated contact can assume personalpage 198
as well as professional dimensions. In such circumstances, service
customers may develop relationships resembling personal
friendships. For example, barbers, beauticians and hairdressers
often serve as personal confidantes; restaurant, bar and café managers may
get to know some of their customers personally. Such personal relationships
can feed a person’s ego (status). For example, one hotel customer
commented, ‘When employees remember and recognize you as a regular
customer, you feel really good’ (Parasuraman et al. 1991).
Building strong, lasting relationships creates opportunities for adding
customer value and developing economically sustainable businesses. Once a
relationship is established it is important to find ways to maintain the quality
of the relationship in order to retain the customer in the longer term.
Developing Customer Retention
Strategies
The potential benefits of developing long-term relationships with customers
mean it is worthwhile investing in designing customer retention strategies; this
involves targeting customers for retention, building trust, bonding, internal
marketing, promise fulfilment and service recovery (see Figure 5.1).

Targeting customers for retention
Not all customers deliver benefits from relationship building, for example
habitual brand-switchers who respond to the lowest-priced deal available
regardless of the brand, low spenders who may not generate sufficient revenue
to justify the expense of acquiring them and maintaining the relationship, and
disruptive customers who may be so troublesome, and whose attitudes and
behaviour may cause so much disruption to the service provider, the costs of
servicing them outweigh the benefits. Consequently, firms and brands need to
analyse customers and identify those they wish to engage in a long-term
relationship. (See Chapter 7 for further discussion of segmentation and
targeting.) The characteristics of customers who are candidates for a
relationship marketing approach are high-value, frequent-use, loyalty-prone
customers for whom the actual and potential service offerings that can be
supplied by the company have high utility. Targeting customers for retention
involves the analysis of loyalty- and defection-prone customers. Firms need to
understand why customers stay or leave, what creates value for them, and their
profile. Decisions can then be made regarding which types of customer
defector they wish to try to save (e.g. price or service defectors) and the nature
of the value-adding strategy that meets their needs, while at the same time
maintaining bonds with loyalty-prone customers (Berry 1995a, 1995b).
Building trust
Customer relationships per se depend on building trust, but trust is also a very
important aspect of customer retention, particularly where the intangible nature
of a service means the customer can find it difficult to evaluate prior to
purchase. Buying a service for the first time can leave the customer with a
feeling of uncertainty and vulnerability, particularly when the service is
personally important (see Chapter 11 for more detailed discussion of
the impact of the characteristics of services). Consequently, when
customers develop trust in a supplier, they are often reluctant to switch to a
new supplier and experience the uncomfortable feelings of uncertainty and
vulnerability all over again. These types of relationships also help to build
partnerships and networks, which can limit duplication of effort, reduce costs,and increase commitment, cooperation and overall satisfaction (Paparoidamis
et al. 2019).
Firms wishing to build trustworthiness should keep in touch with their
customers by regular two-way communication to develop feelings of closeness
and openness, provide guarantees to symbolize the confidence they feel in
their service delivery, reduce their customers’ perceived risk of purchase, and
operate a policy of fairness and high standards of conduct with their customers
(Berry 1995a, 1995b).
Bonding
Retention strategies vary in the degree to which they bond the parties together
but have become an essential part of ensuring long-term profitable
relationships, as developing customer satisfaction does not always lead to
long-term loyalty (Balci et al. 2019). SET suggests, when firms and customers
consider whether to continue or to end a relationship, they go through a
process of evaluation, looking at the rewards and costs (Homans 1958). If the
evaluation is positive the relationship continues; if not, it is terminated.
Through building and then strengthening relationships, enhancing benefits and
building strong bonds, retention rates can be improved (Balci et al. 2019).
Berry and Parasuraman (1991) proposed three retention strategy
approaches based on the types of bond used to cement the relationship:
1. Financial bonding: at this level the bond is primarily through financial
incentives, for example rewards, higher discounts on prices for larger￾volume purchases, or loyalty points and associated tailored promotions,
which can result in lower future prices. This type of bond has been found to
be the best predictor of loyalty (Lee et al. 2015), but it can be difficult to
maintain sustainable competitive advantage, as price incentives are easy for
competitors to copy (e.g. frequent-flyer or loyalty points). Most airlines and
retailers compete in this way, and consumers have learned to join more than
one scheme, thus negating the desired effect.
2. Structural bonding relies on more than price incentives. Building long-term
relationships in this way involves adding customer-specific services
customers feel are rare, expensive or difficult to find (Rodríguez and Wilson
2002). Customers become clients, the relationship becomes personalized
and the service customized. Characteristics of this type of relationship
include frequent communication with customers, providing continuity ofpage 200
service through the same person or people employed by the service provider,
providing personal treatment like sending cards, and enhancing the core
service with educational or entertainment activities such as seminars or
visits to sporting events. Often hotels keep records of their guests’ personal
preferences, such as food allergies and requirements for non-smoking
rooms, and thus build a special bond with customers, who feel they are
being treated as individuals. Increasingly, social media and other forms of
digital communication are used to develop such relationships further.
3. Social bonding focuses on the relational connections that develop between
buyers and sellers and, through these social ties and interpersonal
interactions, the two parties are brought closer together, allowing for the
development of more fruitful relationships. Lin and colleagues (2017) found
this type of bond also effective as a way of retaining customers and
increasing loyalty in the freight-forwarding industry, especially when the
original relationships are built on customer satisfaction. This type of bond
increases emotional ties and the interpersonal nature of relationships
(Schakett et al. 2011).
When combined with financial and social bonds, structural bonds can
create a formidable barrier against competitor inroads and provide the basis
for a sustainable competitive advantage.
Balci et al. (2019) highlighted the importance of a fourth type of
bonding:
4. Relational bonding: this helps sellers increase perceptions of satisfaction
and reward, and gain loyalty.
Promise fulfilment
Promise fulfilment is a cornerstone of service relationships. Service providers
focus on three key activities: making realistic promises initially, and keeping
those promises during service delivery by enabling staff and service systems to
deliver on promises made (Bitner 1995).
Making promises is done through marketing communications channels,
through advertising, selling and promotion, as well as the specific service cues
setting expectations, such as the dress of the service staff, and the design and
décor of the establishment. It is important not to over-promise as this may end
in disappointment, customer dissatisfaction and defection. The
promise should be credible and realistic. Some companies adhereto the adage ‘under-promise and over-deliver’. UK retailer John Lewis made
an enduring commitment (lasting almost 100 years) to its customers, with its
policy promise of ‘never knowingly undersold’. However, in 2022 it dropped
this price-match pledge due to competition from online retailers. Instead, to
retain customer trust and commitment to the brand, it has introduced lower
prices, which promise ‘everyday quality and value’, creating opportunities to
ensure customers can buy quality goods that are stylish and good value (Butler
2022).
Keeping of promises occurs when the customer and service provider
interact – the ‘moment of truth’. For example, pleasant call-centre staff can
create such moments and influence perceptions of the service quality offered
by a firm (Wirtz 2018). Research shows customers judge employees on their
ability to deliver the service right first time, their ability to recover if things go
wrong, how well they deal with special requests, and on their spontaneous
actions and attitudes (see Bitner et al. 1990, 1994). These are key dimensions
that play a part in a training programme, and should be borne in mind when
selecting and rewarding service staff. Not all service encounters are equal in
importance, however.
Research conducted on behalf of Marriott Hotels has shown events
occurring early in a service encounter affect customer loyalty the most. Based
on these findings, Marriott developed its ‘first 10 minutes’ strategy. It is hardly
surprising that first impressions are so important, since before that the
customer has had no direct contact with the service provider and is uncertain
of the outcome. Marriott has become an international market leader, with
luxury destinations worldwide – more than 7,800 properties, luxury brands
Ritz Carlton, Sheraton and Courtyard by Marriott in 138 countries, and plans
for more (Gollan 2017; Baldwin 2021). Customer experiences continue to be
key to the group’s future marketing strategy.
Enabling staff is a necessary condition for promises to be kept. This means
staff must have the skills, competencies, tools, systems and enthusiasm to
deliver, which is dependent on the correct recruitment, training and rewarding
of staff, and on providing them with the right equipment and systems to do
their jobs. Finally, the keeping of promises does not depend solely on service
staff and technology. Service delivery is often performed in a group setting
(e.g. a meal with friends or family in a restaurant, watching a film or travelling
by air), which means the quality of the experience can be as dependent on the
behaviour of other customers as on that of the service provider. Lovelock and
colleagues (1999) labelled problem customers ‘jaycustomers’: people who actin a thoughtless or abusive way, causing problems for the organization, its
employees and other customers. Staff need to be trained to develop the self￾confidence and assertiveness required to deal with such customers and
situations, and to know what to do if a situation escalates beyond their control
and more senior staff need to be involved.
Service recovery
Service recovery strategies should aim to solve problems and restore
customers’ trust in the company, and also improve the service system so the
problem does not reoccur (Kasper et al. 2006). Recovery is crucial, because if
carried out effectively it can encourage customers to become advocates for a
company and will reduce the likelihood of dissatisfied customers telling others
of their negative experiences.
There are three important considerations when establishing a service
recovery strategy:
1. Set up a tracking system to identify system failures: customers should be
encouraged to report service problems, since those customers that do not
complain are the least likely to purchase again. Systems should be
established to monitor complaints, follow up on service experiences (e.g.
through the web, using feedback surveys, by phone), and provide
opportunities for both service staff and customers to feed back on their
experiences.
2. Train and empower staff to respond to service complaints: this is important
because research has shown successful resolution of a complaint can cause
customers to feel more positive about a firm than they did before the service
failure. The first response from a service provider to a genuine complaint is
to apologize. Often this will take the heat out of the situation and lead to a
spirit of cooperation rather than recrimination. The next step is to attempt to
solve the problem quickly. Marriott facilitates this process by empowering
frontline employees to solve customers’ problems quickly, even though this
may mean expense to the hotel, and without recourse to seeking approval
from higher authority. Other key elements in service recovery are to appear
pleasant, helpful and attentive, show concern for the customer and to be
flexible. It is important to note that while careful and appropriate handling
of a complaint can result in a customer developing a positive attitude, if apage 201
second problem occurs, this effect (called the ‘recovery paradox’)
disappears (Maxham and Netemeyer 2002).
3. Encourage learning among staff so service recovery problems are identified
and corrected: service staff should be motivated to report problems and
solutions so recurrent failures are identified and fixed.
In this way, an effective service recovery system can lead to improved
customer service, satisfaction and higher customer retention levels.
Customer retention is fundamental to business success, and technology is
now widely used to gather customer feedback and manage the entire customer
experience. The final part of the chapter examines customer relationship
management.
Customer Relationship Management
Customer relationships, in both consumer and business-to-business markets,
are increasingly managed using technology, and while Sheth (2017) considers
such systems to be responsible for the commoditization of customer
relationships, they are still very important to marketing efforts. Effective
customer relationship management (CRM) begins by understanding the value,
attitudes and behaviour of various customers and prospects, which might form
part of a relationship marketing strategy. Rapid development of digital, mobile
and remote computer technologies has enabled the development of highly
sophisticated CRM systems that can manage relationships, interactions and
customer journeys. These journeys include all the touchpoints where a
customer interacts with a business and then creates a data-collection point (see
below). CRM is seen by many marketers as the practical implementation of
relationship marketing (Harker and Egan 2010). ‘CRM’ is a term that
encompasses the methodologies, technologies and e-commerce capabilities
used by companies to manage customer relationships. CRM software packages
aid the interaction between the customer and the company, enabling the
company to coordinate all of the communication effort so the customer is
presented with a unified message and image.CRM companies offer a range of IT-based services such as call centres,
data analysis and website management. The basic principle behind CRM is
that a firm’s staff have a single-customer point of view of each client. As
customers are now using multiple channels more frequently, they may buy one
product from a salesperson and another from a website. A website may provide
product information, which is used to buy the product from a distributor.
Interactions between a customer and a company may take place through the
sales force, call centres, websites, email and social media. Volvo Construction
Equipment (Volvo CE) has built its reputation on producing high-quality
market-leading equipment and offering excellent customer support (Volvo
Construction Equipment 2015). Business relationships are important and sales
are primarily through local dealers. The firm uses the web as a way for
customers to interact with the brand and submit enquiries through online forms
on its website. However, there was an issue because Volvo was receiving only
limited feedback and a limited number of leads collected from the website;
also customers completing the online form received merely a simple ‘thank
you’ message. It was decided the company should try to make better use of
internet technology to interact with customers, provide more dynamic
information, automate the customer communication process and gather more
data about customer interactions. Volvo CE had to devise a cost-efficient
system to achieve its goals. The team’s response was to create a process that
evaluated customers’ lifecycles and online interactions using the newly
implemented CRM system. Using customer data, the system was able to send
relevant information to customers and up-to-date reports to dealers and internal
staff.
Although the term ‘CRM’ is seen as referring to a recent management
technology, the ideas and principles behind it are not new. Businesses have
long practised some form of CRM. What sets present-day CRM apart is that
companies now have an increased opportunity to use technology and manage
one-to-one relationships with huge numbers of consumers, facilitated by
companies such as Salesforce.com, IBM, SAP and Oracle.
Therefore, no matter how a customer contacts a company, all staff have
instant access to the same data about the customer, such as their details and
past purchases. This usually means the consolidation of the many databases
held by individual departments in a company into one centralized database that
can be accessed by all relevant staff on a computer screen.page 202
Success factors in CRM
CRM projects have met with mixed results. As the customer journeys and
experiences become a more important feature in marketing initiatives, so does
the successful deployment of CRM systems and associated technologies. It has
been found that nearly half of CRM projects fail due to insufficient attention
being paid to the processes involved and the function the system was designed
to achieve. People can also create issues in the adoption of new CRM systems
by resisting the use of the new technology or having a lack of adequate
training. Many CRM systems have been found to fail due to lack of
planning and clear objectives. Finally, about a third of CRM systems
fail due to lack of suitable technology (Band 2013).
The following factors are associated with successful CRM
implementations:
having a customer orientation and organizing the CRM system around
customers
taking a single view of customers across departments, and designing an
integrated system so all customer-facing staff can draw information from a
common database
having the ability to manage cultural change issues that arise as a result of
system development and implementation
involving users in the CRM design process
designing the system in such a way that it can readily be changed to meet
future requirements
having a board-level champion of the CRM project, commitment within
each of the affected departments to the benefits of taking a single view of
the customer, and an understanding of the need for common strategies (e.g.
prioritizing resources with profitable customers)
creating ‘quick wins’ to provide positive feedback on the project
programmes
ensuring face-to-face contact (rather than on paper or by email) between
marketing and IT staff
piloting the new system before full launch.
Much of the development of CRM systems and solutions is being driven
through digital marketing and customer experience initiatives, as customers
expect to have instantaneous access to information. Consequently, it has
become more of an imperative to ensure CRM systems perform effectively,page 203
especially as they are being used in all business sectors. For example, in the
not-for-profit sector, donations are increasingly being made by mobile phone
and through social media platforms; retailers are selling more online; and
airlines and other transport companies use mobile phones to supply travel
updates (IBM with Frost & Sullivan 2011). Social media has grown in
importance as individuals share their experiences on everything from grocery
shopping and eating out to engagement in large-scale fundraising campaigns.
Examples of hashtag campaigns include: #ShareYourEars, a campaign
launched by Disney to raise funds for the Make-A-Wish Foundation;
#RebuildTheWorld, LEGO’s campaign to inspire users of its product during
the Covid-19 pandemic; #SmileCookie, an annual campaign by coffee chain
Tim Hortons, which raises millions of dollars for local charities in Canada; and
#BeyondFiveStars, a campaign aimed at spotlighting Uber drivers’
performance (Forbes 2021).
CRM systems are becoming progressively more complex as the number of
potential touchpoints where a customer can interact with a company increases
(see Figure 5.2). Touchpoints are where customers interact with a company
and data about these interactions can be gathered. Interactions with customers
can be through physical human interactions, for example with customer
service staff or sales representatives, or where customers interact
virtually, for example through loyalty schemes, online reviews
and search enquiries. Interactions can also occur at any stage in a customer
journey, and give rise to opportunities for companies to use the touchpoint
productively. For example, a retailer might offer existing customers a future
discount if they refer a friend through the company website, or on receipt of a
delivery a customer might be encouraged to comment on the quality of the
product and the delivery service.
FIGURE 5.2
Touchpoints where customers might interact with a companyAs customers engage with companies through a variety of touchpoints, it
becomes increasingly challenging to ensure the quality of the customer
experience. Figure 5.3 shows a potential cross-channel touchpoint customer
experience (Gill 2014). Initially, customers may become aware of a new
product or service through traditional channels, for example broadcast media,
TV or radio. As they begin to consider, evaluate and move towards selecting a
particular product, they may move over to digital channels, for example online
reviews and blogs. Once customers are ready to make a purchase, they may
choose from various channels, for example online, in-store or through a direct
mail catalogue. After the sale is complete, customers may seek advice about
how to use their product, for example through an online FAQs database, or
comment on their experience in a forum. Finally, they might become an
advocate for their chosen product and make future purchases, read newsletters
and even write a blog post about their experiences.
FIGURE 5.3
Touchpoints in a cross-channel customer journeyCross-channel touchpoints test companies who wish to manage their
customers’ journeys to ensure a uniform experience. Many brands struggle to
provide a seamless customer experience. For example, Gap offers its
customers a flexible click-and-collect service to pick up their online orders
through any of the group’s stores, such as Gap, Old Navy and Banana
Republic. But, when it comes to returning goods, customers must take the
returns back to the specific store selling the brand they have purchased. The
problem for retailers is reverse logistics – in other words, getting the goods
back to where the stock was originally held, especially if a retailer manages
online and offline stock through different locations (Gill 2014), and customers
are left struggling to work out where to return their goods.
Air Canada is another example where there are breaks in the cross-channel
customer experience: its customers can book flights via mobile devices, but
cannot amend the details or change flights via any digital touchpoints.
Customers wishing to make changes must use the telephone. As a result, the
cross-channel experience can be frustrating rather than rewarding.
So, how can companies manage multiple cross-channel touchpoints and
use their CRM systems effectively? According to research (Gill 2014),
companies should consider the overall customer experience and aim to
‘identify, design, implement and optimize end-to-end customer journeys’. In
order to do this, they should aim to follow three rules (Gill 2014):
1. Do not try to please everyone. Marketing managers should aim to
concentrate on creating high-value experiences which involve touchpoints
that create meaningful journeys for target customers. They should also
identify tasks that add value to the experience.page 204
For example, Starbucks has developed a cross-touchpoint experience for
its tech-savvy customers. It uses sophisticated software and GPS positioning
to push time-specific offers to its customers in particular locations. The aim
is to increase footfall in Starbucks coffee shops. The My
Starbucks app enables pre-payment and acts as a point of sale
using QR codes; it also links to an individual’s loyalty data to be used for
future promotions.
Finally, the focus should also be on a frequently occurring task, as it is
not viable to try to streamline every customer journey. For example, DIY
brand Wickes serves consumers and trade customers using web, social
media and store to deliver a fully integrated customer service package.
Wickes partnered with specialist marketing and data analytics firm Team
ITG to interpret customer inputs at every stage of the customer journey to
‘build stronger and more meaningful relationships with customers’. The
approach taken by Wickes has succeeded in increasing trade (Retail Week
2022).
2. Optimize the journey, not the touchpoint. Marketing managers responsible
for mapping customer journeys have to decide which channels and
technologies will provide the best customer journey. They should also
ensure each touchpoint is deemed important.
Prisma, one of Finland’s most advanced online retailers, designed its
customer journey by mapping out a series of common touchpoints shoppers
wanted to use. The journey maps showed how customers used mobile
phones, the web and physical stores; when the maps were combined with
historical customer data, the retailer was able to improve the customer
experience.
Ultimately, the marketer should aim to understand how an individual
touchpoint contributes to the total customer journey.
3. Manage the transitions. Marketing managers should look for innovative
ways to move customers from one touchpoint to another and across
channels. One way to achieve this is to make sure the customer is in control.
So, if customers need to move from the digital to physical space, for
example in getting their eyes tested and buying a pair of glasses, the online
appointment system should ensure there is sufficient choice of appointment
times. The earlier example of Starbucks demonstrates how the digital and
physical space can be linked using a mobile device.page 205
As customers become more connected and more familiar with using
multiple touchpoints, it will become increasingly important for all companies
to manage their customer journeys effectively in order to deliver a seamless
customer experience.
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapterpage 206
 Detailed Review
1. Value creation
Companies engage in value creation when they enter into exchanges with their
customers, and this is central to building relationships. Co-creation of value
involves information sharing to aid supplier learning, supplier development and
strategic knowledge sharing.
2. The key concepts of relationship marketing
The concepts are: relationship quality, service quality, trust, satisfaction,
commitment and loyalty.
3. The nature of relationship marketing and how to build customer relationships
Relationship marketing concerns the shift from activities associated with attracting
customers to activities concerned with current customers and how to retain them.
A key element is the building of trust between buyers and sellers.
Relationship building can be enhanced by the provision of customer services,
including giving technical support, expertise, resource support, improving service
levels and using risk-reduction strategies.
4. Value and relational networks
People and the roles they play within the network.
‘Network’ is a term used to describe a set of connections among people, which,
from a marketing perspective, might be used as a resource to solve problems,
share knowledge and extend the network.
5. Types of relationship management
Relationships can take different forms. There are three key types of
relationship:
1) Classic market relationships: supplier–customer, supplier–customer–
competitor and the physical distribution network.
2) Special market relationships, such as between the customer as a member of a
loyalty programme and the interaction in the service encounter.
3) Relationships with the economy and society in general.
6. The management of customer relationships
This concerns focusing a company’s activities on building long-term relationships
and identifying opportunities for relationship development, for example where
there is a desire from the customer for delivery of an ongoing service, where the
customer makes a choice of service provider or where the customer has many
alternative suppliers to choose from.
7. Building customer relationships
Effective relationships can be a source of competitive advantage and are
developed through a number of different operational aspects of a business:
technical support, expertise, resource support, service levels and risk reduction.page 207
8. Benefits to the organization
Engaging in relationship management can deliver a number of benefits to the
organization: increased purchases, lower costs, lifetime value of a customer,
sustainable competitive advantage, employee satisfaction and retention.
9. Benefits to the customer
For relationships to work, there should be mutual benefits for all parties involved.
For the customer, potential benefits are stress reduction, higher-quality service,
avoidance of switching costs, social and status benefits.
10. Customer retention strategies are central to the marketing effort of relationship
marketing
Customer retention involves the targeting of customers for retention, bonding,
internal marketing, promise fulfilment, building of trust and service recovery.
11. Customer relationship management (CRM)
Technology is key to the development of successful relationships.
CRM systems are technology-based solutions that facilitate interactions between
the customer and the company, enabling the company to coordinate all of the
communication effort so the customer is presented with a unified message and
image.
Cross-channel customer journeys occur when customers interact with different
channels during the purchasing process.

STARBUCKS: BREWING
GREAT CUSTOMEREXPERIENCES THROUGH
OUTSTANDING DIGITAL
MARKETING
Starbucks is often credited with transforming coffee from a basic commodity to a gourmet
experience in the United States. Founded more than 50 years ago, the company is hugely
successful, generating revenue of US$29.06 billion (2021) with net income of US$4.2 billion
(2021). From its humble beginnings in Seattle, Starbucks is now the world’s largest coffee
house chain, located in 80 countries, with almost 34,000 stores. And while known for providing
its customers with delicious (if pricey) coffee, as well as free Wi-Fi and a place to relax, the
company is also trying to provide them with something more – a personal relationship. And, so
far, it seems to be succeeding.

Starbucks famously described its vision of reaching its customers as ‘one neighbourhood, one
person and one cup at a time’. And thanks to its effective use of digital marketing, social media,
customer relationships and technology management, the company is doing just that.
Starbucks appears to be one of the few companies that truly understands the intricate
triangulation between consumers, a product and social media, and how the three, when
successfully managed, can increase a brand’s profile and develop a relationship between that
brand and a customer (while, at the same time, generating higher sales). As proof of Starbucks
getting its customer relationship management right, a reported nine out of ten people who use
Facebook are either fans of Starbucks or know somebody who is.
Starbucks is a leader in its class when it comes to incorporating the latest technological
developments into its operations, allowing it to almost seamlessly merge its bricks-and-mortar
stores with the numerous digital marketing channels available. The company has also been
adept at developing relationships with its customers, using the latest online innovations and
social media platforms (Starbucks is present on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, to
name just a few). Starbucks is adamant when it says that the purpose of new technology is notpage 211
just to improve its website or to process payments more quickly for people who are queuing up
– it is really about getting in touch with its customers and trying to better understand them, so
as to improve the level of service and customers’ experience with the brand. As a sign of its
commitment, the company has reportedly taken all the money it used to spend on traditional
media outlets and shifted it into digital and social media marketing, in an effort to deepen and
consolidate its relationship with its customers.
Experts believe that, when trying to build or protect customer relationships, there are certain
rules of etiquette that should be respected. One important principle is to engage with customers
on their own terms and to the degree that they want to be engaged with. ‘Pushing’ an ad in this
always-connected age really does not work, especially with millennials and Generation Z, who
were basically born into a world of social media. Today, the expectation for many is that they
will ‘invite’ a brand or product into their lives, while at the same time actively resisting something
that is ‘forced’ upon them. As with any relationship, ‘desperation’ is the world’s worst cologne.
Part of Starbucks’ sustained efforts to build a relationship with customers is providing ease of
service. Customers, for example, can place orders using a mobile app. It’s a win–win
proposition: thirsty clients gets the products they want and great customer service; Starbucks
gets access to critical email addresses and smartphone information, allowing for customized
ads and better promotion of the Starbucks brand, in addition to a more personalized customer
relationship. The company says that it uses a ‘data-driven AI algorithm’ that can analyse
people’s preferences and behaviours, as well as the behaviours that Starbucks is trying to
promote, to come up with personalized suggestions for additional products that a customer may
wish to purchase. In fact, Starbucks’ mobile app is so popular it is surpassed only by Apple in
terms of number of users. The results? By the end of March 2022, digital sales for the coffee
company had reached a reported US$3 billion.
This emphasis on digital marketing has resulted in digitally engaged customers. It has been
estimated that 38 per cent of all of Starbucks’ transactions are made electronically. As a
company executive says, ‘digitally engaged customers purchase two to three times as many
products as those that are not digitally engaged’.
Another key element in Starbucks’ efforts at relationship development is the successful way the
company has been able to merge its physical presence with its digital one. While Covid
changed the way many people behaved, with increased use of online ordering and delivery, it
appears that many people still want to pick up their favourite items at a store. As a result,
Starbucks has modified the format of some of its outlets, offering pickup-only locations in the
United States. These stores are small and have no seating, catering expressly to customers
using the ordering app and who just want a coffee while they are on the go. Starbucks says that
its ‘vision is that each large city in the US will ultimately have a mix of traditional Starbucks
cafés and Starbucks Pickup locations’. This new format is basically the opposite of the
traditional set-up that made the coffee chain so successful. The fact that the company is willing
to radically redesign a key component of its strategy shows just how far it is willing to go to
bring convenience to its customers and engage with them in the manner they want.
Starbucks says it is committed to developing ‘new choices and experiences that surprise and
delight our customers at every interaction’, in an effort to better serve them as well as develop a
relationship with them … one cup of coffee at a time.Questions
1. What are some of the ways in which Starbucks ‘engages’ its consumers in customer
relationships?
2. How can an understanding of digital marketing and social media help companies gain a
competitive advantage when it comes to customer relationship management?
3. Analyse the methods used by Starbucks and explain how the company has been
successful in increasing its brand recognition, while at the same time improving its customer
relationship management.

MANCHESTER CITY
FOOTBALL CLUB: CO￾CREATING THE FUTURE
Introduction
Manchester City Football Club (FC) was founded in 1880, under the name of St Mark’s,
changing its name to Manchester City in 1894. In 2008, the club received a significant financial
boost when taken over by billionaire Sheikh Mansour. Today, Manchester City has risen to
become one of the most successful clubs in the Premier League. In 2022, Forbes ranked it as
the world’s sixth-most valuable football club, worth US$4.25 billion. On the surface, Manchester
City is a typical football club, with a primary focus on player acquisition and Premier League
performance. However, what sets the club apart is its dedicated early technology pushes, which
focus on building a strong bond with fans.Source: bodrumsurf/Shutterstock
This case examines Manchester City FC’s co-creation strategies, where building relationships
with its fans is central to all marketing activities. Over the years, the club has been at the
forefront of many innovations, and has shown its prescience in adopting new technologies and
its savviness in creating a seamless digital experience. Manchester City is a pioneer of
innovation in Premier League football and adept at developing relationships with its fans.
Co-creation Innovations
In 2016, Manchester City FC’s website was completely overhauled and designed in conjunction
with the team’s fans. The club engages in value co-creation with its fans by involving them in
every aspect of the design – from colour schemes, usability and content provision, to device
compatibility (desktop, mobile and app). Furthermore, the team crest was co-created with fans
through focus groups, prototype designs and user testing. By engaging with its fan base,
listening to their needs and observing their behaviour, the club has empowered its fans, and
facilitated the development of direct and deeper relationships.
Since 2017, the club has been diligently building up a virtual brand community, ‘Cityzens’,
based around fans’ shared lifestyles and ethos. Through a dedicated mobile app and/or social
media, fans are enabled to gather as a community of support for the club. The virtual
community has become an important way of delivering content direct to the fans, enabling the
club to increase its global, digital and mobile fan base. The app allows fans to locate one
another on maps and to initiate chat sessions. The mapping functionality is leveraged to
provide fans with experiences, such as trips to matches and meetings with players. Rewards
are also offered (e.g. invitations to match screenings, special events and free merchandise)
based on the fan’s level of participation in the community. Additionally, as fans register with the
app, they are sent personalized video messages from the club’s management and players.
Fans also gain rewards when they reach certain milestones, such as attending every match in a
season. Providing direct incentives to the fans increases their positivity towards the club and
encourages them to engage more with the Cityzens community. In 2020, Manchester City
launched its virtual Young Leaders Summit, which connects young Cityzens with community
coaches to share learning and innovation on using the power of football to uplift the health and
well-being of young people in their communities (Manchester City 2022).
Expanding its digital footprint, in 2021 Manchester City and Sony Group Corporation
announced a new global cooperation aimed at developing innovative digital fan experiences
where supporters can connect with the club and one another in an online ‘metaverse’
(Manchester City 2021b). Drawing on the technology of several Sony Group companies as well
as Manchester City’s global intellectual property, the first step in this collaboration was the
execution of a proof of concept (PoC), with the goal of creating new types of digital content andservices that combine the physical and virtual worlds to thrill and engage both page 213
current and future generations of sports fans around the world. The Sony
collaboration includes, for example, a virtual recreation of the Etihad Stadium. The ‘Virtual
Etihad Stadium’ is not only a realistic representation of the stadium in Manchester, UK, but also
a gateway to exclusive virtual experiences for fans, including customizable avatars and
interactive loyalty programmes, all of which will provide fans with new ways to express their
fandom.
Following the lead of other clubs, such as AC Milan and Juventus, Manchester City has
extended its innovation portfolio into the realm of cryptocurrency (digital currency such as
bitcoin, called ‘tokens’). In 2021, the club launched the $CITY Fan Token. Purchasing this token
enables fans to vote in club-organized polls, and access new promotions, VIP experiences,
games and augmented reality features. To promote the concept, registered Cityzens are offered
a free token though an online voucher scheme (Manchester City 2021a).
Beyond the Pitch: Hackathons and eSports
In 2017, encroaching into the domain of tech giants such as Google and Facebook, Manchester
City became the world’s first football club to host a hackathon (Wikipedia 2018). A hackathon is
an event where computer programmers, graphic designers, interface designers and subject
matter experts get together for a defined period (typically a day) to collaborate and create new
innovations. The event helped the club uncover new insights on player performance, while at
the same time enhancing its innovative image. Multiple hackathon teams came together, and
were provided with access to player data sets and analytics (such as club/player performance).
The teams were also provided with the technology to enable real-time data visualizations,
which are typically used for news and sports reporting, so they could develop their own
designs. The winning team created a machine learning system that focused on in-match
decision-making, and which has the potential to improve decisions made by management in
terms of set pieces, player substitutions and so on.
In 2019, building on the hackathon concept, Manchester City held a Startup Challenge at the
Etihad Campus in Manchester, encouraging companies to submit innovative concepts based on
five important characteristics of match days at the Etihad. The project attracted 230 applications
from organizations in 37 countries, and the finalists were selected to attend a week-long
acceleration programme in Manchester to further develop their concepts in conjunction with a
team of club staff (Manchester City 2019). The characteristics of typical match days targeted by
the initiative included: waste reduction, increased energy efficiency and carbon footprint
reduction in stadia; enhancing the match-day experience through queue elimination and
enhanced service accessibility; how to further involve the crowd in the action at a match; how to
create a unique experience for each fan; how to create the global stadium concept where fans
feel part of a family unlimited by geography.
The Future
Manchester City’s innovations have increased global awareness of the club, while significantly
improving levels of service and customer (fan) relationships. It has been the fastest-growing
club on social media for the past few seasons. In 2022, it had one of the most subscribed-to
Premier League club channels on YouTube, with just short of 4.4 million subscribers. Its long￾term goal is to become the premium team, both on and off the pitch, while always maintaining
and building relationships with its fans.page 214
Further developing its cryptocurrency portfolio, in 2022 the club joined forces with Puma to
create a collaborative non-fungible token (NFT) to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its first
Premier League title. An NFT is a one-of-a-kind digital asset, such as a work of art, with an
inherent digital value. This is the fourth such NFT drop, which the club leverages to build its
presence and collector community in the NFT space. This level of innovation has not gone
unnoticed, with Manchester City recognized by Sports Innovation Lab as the world’s most
innovative sports team (Hunt 2022).

n this chapter, we explore marketing analytics, and how the changing
information landscape is influencing the practice of market research. The
internet, smartphones, social media networks and other digital innovations
have profoundly altered the way we communicate. Digital technologies are
disrupting traditional methods of gathering, processing and utilizing marketing
information: data can be collected and analysed instantaneously, enabling
measurement of real-time behaviour (Poynter et al. 2014). Understandingmarketing analytics is increasingly producing efficiency gains and creating
opportunities for marketing activities to be more effective. Marketers use big
data to inform decision-making, aid organizational goal-setting and ensure
control. Moreover, the capacity to interpret meaning from big data becomes
more important as the sources of data increase. In the last few years, the flow
of big data has grown dramatically as use of the internet has extended
throughout the supply chain and into the hands of consumers as they shop
online and via mobile devices. Big data is generated in quantities that are
difficult to comprehend, for example petabytes, zettabytes and yottabytes.
These volumes of data are generated from many sources, from barcode
scanners to smartphones and cars, and come in different forms, including
videos, documents, spreadsheets, online purchases, blogs and tweets. The list
is becoming ever longer as the Internet of Things (IoT) connects more and
more elements of human interaction to a plethora of digital devices
(Kerschberg 2014). It is estimated that 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created
every day (Marr 2018).
There are significant implications for marketing as customers (B2B and
B2C) interact with firms, products and services differently via digital
platforms. Also, these interactions–whether Google searches, Facebook posts
or tweets–are being monitored and the data analysed. Cookies–tiny pieces of
data stored in web browsers–are used to record website visits and dwell time
on each site and page (Pagliery 2015). Browser fingerprinting is used to
provide behavioural advertisers (BAs) with information they need to develop
highly targeted and personalized promotional offers; from watching browsing
behaviour and analysing the data, BAs can infer your age, gender and personal
interests without ever asking your permission (Truste 2015). But data
collection does not stop with web browsing; Samsung’s Smart TV enabled the
company to gather viewing behaviour directly from the television (BBC 2015),
and voice-activated speakers like Amazon’s Echo range are constantly
gathering data.
However, it is important to understand data is only of value once it is
analysed and turned into business intelligence (Kerschberg 2014). Read
Marketing in Action 6.3, later in the chapter, to find out how GSK is using big
data in this way.
Now let’s explore the links between data, marketing goals, performance
and measurement.page 217
Digital Marketing Analytics: Goals,
Performance and Measurement
Digital marketing analytics play an increasingly significant role in
demonstrating how marketing activities translate into revenue. As discussed in
Chapter 1, marketers are increasingly being challenged to prove the benefits of
their marketing efforts, especially in relation to goal achievement and
performance. Marketing analytics are the tools, technologies, systems and
processes that are used to reveal insights, measure performance, drive growth
and lead to more informed decision-making.
In the past, marketing information systems were designed to provide
quality information that had an impact on the effectiveness of decision-making
(Daniels et al. 2003). As use of these systems became widespread, previous
piecemeal systems were replaced by integrated customer relationship
management systems to provide a unified view of the customer and actionable
market intelligence. But the proliferation of data collection points and greater
use of digital technology by all has generated mountains of data that firms
struggle to use effectively. Read Hidden Gem 6.1 to see how Alteryx is helping
firms solve complex data problems.
HIDDEN GEM 6.1
Alteryx Automates Data and Speeds Up Digital
Transition
Award-winning business intelligence and software firm Alteryx has developed a platform to
give firms the opportunity to better understand data across their businesses. The Alteryx
Analytical Process Automation (APA) platform develops data insights automatically, by
interconnecting data sources across a firm. Data can be stored in different locations and in
different formats from spreadsheets and databases to outputs from business processes,
people and machines. With automated augmented machine learning Alteryx can help firms
gain a better understanding of how their businesses work, and where opportunities exist for
future development, as in the following examples.Source: metamorworks/Shutterstock
Roquette is a firm leading the way in Europe with innovation in plant-based ingredients for
use in food, nutrition and health products. The decisions made by Pierre-Louis Bescond,
Roquette’s head of data science, and his teams may be critical to the firm’s progress in
designing and manufacturing raw materials to produce important medicines and new foods
for the future. A major challenge for this business is data management and how to get to the
data insights needed to enable the production of plant-based raw materials. Alteryx provides
Roquette with automated data management systems, which can reveal insights from the
data-generating sensors and systems across the firm’s many large and dynamic data sets.
Global telecommunications, internet and network service provider British Telecom (BT)
operates in more than 180 countries. A main part of its business is voice and mobile
telecommunications, broadband services and TV. BT must comply with strict regulations
regarding data privacy. Previously BT had more than 140 different Excel modules running
its data processing, and large teams of data scientists to ensure compliance with data rules.
Due to the complexity of the systems the risk of error was high, control difficult, staffing cost
expensive and opportunity to identify data insights low. Alteryx trained BT teams using its
self-service training academy to work with new agile data systems, which enabled BT to
implement digital transformation across the global business. BT is able to analyse millions
of data points accurately and within the regulations, which has helped streamline the firm,
improve data transparency and improve services.
Retailer 7-Eleven has more than 9,000 convenience stores in the US and over 70,000
worldwide, and its operation generates vast amounts of data. The problem for the retailer is
combining and analysing its data to produce necessary and meaningful insights to improve
business operations. Convenience stores in general have been slower than other retailers
to adopt digital technologies, and have been missing opportunities to communicate with and
offer promotional deals to their customers. At 7-Eleven, data reporting was done by different
firms and producing business-wide insights for strategic decision-making was difficult. At an
operational level, low-tech solutions, manual data inputting and processing of tax returns
meant the retailer had a very large finance department. Alteryx helped the business bring its
data sources together to produce business insights, reducing the number of analysts
needed and saving staffing costs, and transformed product promotions, which could be
targeted to specific customers and locations.
In summary, Alteryx’s APA suite of data solutions, automation of data management and
handling has enabled many firms in a wide range of industrial activity sectors to improve
productivity, identify new business opportunities and leverage success from data.page 218

It is still worthwhile to review the principles of a traditional marketing
information system to understand which marketing information is formally
gathered, stored, analysed and distributed to managers in accord with their
informational needs on a regular planned basis (Jobber and Rainbow 1977).
Data from the marketing environment is translated into information. The
difference between data and information is as follows:
Data are the most basic form of knowledge, for example the brand of butter
sold to a customer in a certain town; this statistic is of little worth but may
become meaningful when combined with other data.
Information is a combination of data that provides decision-relevant
knowledge, for example the brand preferences of customers in a certain age
category in a geographic region could enable butter producer Lurpak to plan
a targeted marketing campaign.
Digital technology is transforming the opportunities to collect data from
multiple sources in real time. As a result, the volume of data being generated
has increased significantly and is now referred to as ‘big data’ (very large data
sets). Big data analytics can identify hidden patterns in behaviour, which can
be translated into market advantage (Erevelles et al. 2016). For marketers to
benefit from this glut of data, it must be managed and analysed correctly. But
the problem with big data is that it ‘just happens’, is unstructured and (unlike
market research data) is not collected to answer a specific question (see later in
the chapter for discussion of market research). Also, it is argued that the data￾intensive digital era is fundamentally changing approaches towards research,
data gathering and processing (Muller et al. 2017), moving information
systems closer to performance measurement.
The need for marketing-orientated businesses to have structured
approaches for obtaining big data and turning it into marketing intelligence
(the actionable knowledge produced by the analysis of big data, withimplications for decision-making) is intensified. According to Chaffey and
Ellis-Chadwick (2022), marketing goals, performance and measurement
should be considered on an organization-wide basis, reflect information
requirements in relation to the level of organizational decision-making and
relate to varying levels of marketing control. Figure 6.1 shows key questions
for planning performance measurement and marketing control systems.
FIGURE 6.1
The Marketing Performance Measurement Framework
Source: adapted from Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick (2022)
Answering the following broad questions can help to achieve a structured
approach to creating a marketing performance measurement system:
What do we want to achieve? Marketers need to frame the questions they
want big data and marketing analytics systems to solve, and relate their
questions to organizational goals (at both strategic and tactical levels). For
example, a firm may incorporate Google Analytics into its website, which
will produce reports (e.g. website traffic, visitor behaviour, site
performance), but this data needs to be linked to specific marketing
objectives to effectively inform decision-making. The website traffic mightpage 219
increase at a point in time due to a one-off promotional event, but customer
retention may be in decline as customers are utilizing the offer but not
returning or creating a long-term relationship. If the goal is to build a
sustainable online customer base, monitoring the pull of one-off promotions
is not providing the information needed. Careful planning is required to
ensure that the right data are collected to answer appropriate questions, and
ensure the effectiveness of strategic and or tactical goals.
What is happening? Performance measurement is central to understanding
efficiency. According to Chaffey (2000), organizations create management
frameworks around specific groupings of metrics, which assess marketing
performance. He suggested that macro-level metrics can assess the
efficiency of strategic goals, while micro-level metrics assess the efficiency
of tactical goals. There are many software systems that create performance
measurement dashboards (e.g. IBM Cognos Analytics; see Exhibit 6.1).
Why (is it happening)? Performance diagnostics systems can then identify
details of why certain outcomes are succeeding or failing against planned
marketing goals. To achieve a good level of understanding of what is
happening, marketers should review when marketing campaigns
and plans are being implemented and who is involved. Roche
(global healthcare) utilizes a diagnostic system to ensure that suppliers and
end consumers receive the best healthcare products when they are needed,
which has helped to develop new levels of customer engagement and deeper
understanding of customer requirements (Roche Diagnostics 2018).
What should we do? Once the actual performance has been reviewed against
the set goals, the next stage in the process is to take corrective action, to
improve performance.
EXHIBIT 6.1
Marketing analytic performance dashboardWhile much data is gathered through digital channels, there are also three
other aspects and sources of data to consider: internal continuous data; internal
ad hoc data and data from environmental scanning; and market research.
Internal continuous data
Firms possess an enormous amount of marketing and financial data that can be
used for marketing decision-making and should be incorporated into the
performance management system as this can enable the conversion of financial
data and a range of other data into a form usable by marketing management.
A marketing information system (MkIS) provides managers with analysis
and marketing information, which can be used to support decision-making and
strategic planning. An MkIS may stimulate the provision of information that
marketing managers can use, for example about the profitability of a particular
product, customer or distribution channel, or even the profitability of a
particular product to an individual customer. Widespread integration of
information systems across businesses provides great insight into customers
and promotes more informed decision-making. An MkIS can incorporate big
data and then provide opportunities to delve deeply into consumer behaviour,
by monitoring consumers’ profiles, attitudes, preferences and purchasing
behaviour (Salvador and Ikeda 2014). Internal data become more complex aspage 220
information and data-collection points start to include websites, mobile apps
and social media.
Another application of the MkIS concept to internal continuous data is
within the area of sales force management. As part of the sales management
function, many sales forces are monitored by means of recording sales
achieved, number of calls made, size of orders, number of new accounts
opened, and so on. This can be recorded in total or broken down by product or
customer/customer type. The establishment of an MkIS where these data are
stored and analysed over time can provide information on sales force
effectiveness. For example, a fall-off in performance of a salesperson can
quickly be identified and remedial action taken.
Internal ad hoc data
Company data can also be used for a specific (ad hoc research) purpose. For
example, management may look at how sales have reacted to a price increase
or a change in advertising copy. Although this could be part of a continuous
monitoring programme, specific one-off analyses are inevitably required from
time to time. Capturing the data on the MkIS allows specific analyses to be
conducted when needed.
Environmental scanning
The environmental scanning procedures discussed in Chapter 2 also form part
of the MkIS, and this includes environmental analysis–whereby the economic,
social, political, legal, technological and ecological/physical forces are
monitored. These forces can be difficult to monitor due to their amorphous
nature but are important as they can shape the context within which the
company, suppliers, distributors and the competition do business.
Environmental scanning provides an early-warning system for the forces that
may impact on a company’s products and markets in the future (Jain and Haley
2009). In this way, scanning enables an organization to act on, rather than react
to, opportunities and threats. The focus is on the longer-term perspective,
allowing a company to be in the position to plan ahead, and information from
data analysis provides a major input into strategic decisions such as whichfuture products to develop and markets to enter, and the formulation of a
competitive strategy (e.g. to attack or defend against competition).
Market research
While environmental scanning focuses on the longer term, marketing
research considers the more immediate situation and is primarily concerned
with providing information about markets, and customer reactions to various
product, price, distribution and promotion decisions (Moutinho and Evans
1992). As such, market research is a key part of the MkIS because it makes a
major contribution to marketing mix planning.
There are two main types of external market research:
1. External continuous data sources include TV audience monitoring and
consumer panels where household purchases are recorded over time.
Loyalty cards are also a source of continuous data, providing information on
customer purchasing patterns and responses to promotions. The growth of
digital technology and the uptake of e-commerce has led to new forms of
continuous data collection, as has the development of mobile apps. See
Marketing in Action 6.1 to find out more about the power of apps as a
source of data collection.
2. External ad hoc data are often gathered by means of surveys into specific
marketing issues, including usage and attitude studies, advertising and
product testing, and corporate image research. More traditional forms of
market research–telephone and face-to-face interviews–are being replaced
by digital survey techniques. Digital platforms (web and mobile) are being
used not only for gathering quantitative survey data but also for gathering
qualitative data through real-time audio and online video discussions. Social
media is also providing access to an innovative form of digital discussion
group, and companies are analysing online conversations to find out what
their consumers really think about their products (Manning 2011).
MARKETING IN ACTION 6.1
Proximity Apps and Customer Informationpage 221
Proximity marketing is creating endless possibilities for marketing to link consumers to
events to generate revenue. Beacons send location-based marketing messages to
consumers’ mobile devices via Wi-Fi networks and a system of servers. Nodes is a
specialist agency, based in London and Copenhagen, which develops proximity marketing
mobile apps for big brands such as Carlsberg, GSK, BMW, Unilever and Samsung, and
aims to make strong connections with users. Its apps can be designed to meet various
objectives, for example for social engagement, product demonstrations, tracking user
experiences and proximity marketing campaigns. For example, Crowdit developed a social
bar finder app as a proximity marketing tool. The aim for Crowdit was to enable customers
to generate a voucher on their mobile phones that could be used in a nearby bar. The app
included other features so its users could order a cab, find a particular type of bar, and be
informed of events and promotions. The app was designed for Carlsberg, but there was
none of the beer’s branding on the app, so any bar was able to sign up to use it. Bar owners
in Denmark responded as quickly as their customers, with more than 100,000 downloads
soon after the app’s launch.
Customers were offered a voucher that they could also share with their friends. iBeacons
were used to send out notifications when a customer was within close proximity of a Crowdit
bar. An iBeacon is a small Bluetooth device that transmits signals from a chosen location to
smartphones that come within its range. Once the customer had a voucher the bar
redeemed it in exchange for a drink.
The bar owners benefited, as they received all the information about each user of the
voucher and could view the analytics, which enabled them to update events based on
customer adoption rates and engagement. Additional data gathering from vouchers being
shared with friends meant the iBeacons also acted as a bridge between the digital and the
physical world and kept track of how long a particular user was within range. This enabled
bar owners to send highly targeted offers, for example a second drink notification. The
second voucher is sent at the critical point at which the consumer decides whether to stayor move to a new location. The information provided by the app and the iBeacons can be
used to develop customer loyalty and customer retention.
Proximity apps are not just for B2C markets. DFDS developed an app with Nodes for its
ferry service between Copenhagen and Oslo. The aim was to strengthen loyalty and
retention, and to encourage customers to opt for sea rather than air travel. The app
provided information about travel times and sailing, but also shopping offers. The success of
the consumer-facing app sparked the development of an app for freight clients. The app
enables heavy goods vehicle freight drivers to also have access to all the information they
need, when and where they need it, to ensure the smoothest movement of goods. DFDS
envisages being able to streamline its whole freight division due to the efficient
communication system provided by the proximity app.

The rest of this chapter will examine the process of marketing research and
the factors that affect the use of research information.
Marketing research (MR) is used by an increasing range of types of
organization, from political parties to community groups. Some MR agencies
specialize in particular types of market research. For example, Ipsos MORI
specializes in brand loyalty, advertising, and political and social research;
Sherbert Research focuses on qualitative research with children and teenagers.
Watermelon Research specializes in customer experience insights. Qa
Research is a full-service market research agency for public, private and
voluntary sectors. See Exhibit 6.2 to see the range of services offered by a full￾service market research agency. Furthermore, not only are organizations
making more use of technology, but the technology itself is also enabling more
insightful analysis. The market research industry is penetrating deeper into the
psyche of individual consumers using data-driven marketing techniques.

Customer Insights and Data-driven
Marketing
Digital technology is changing how customers interact with firms, and some
marketers are even reverting to mass marketing as they struggle to keep up
with the changing behaviour (Bibby et al. 2021). Marketers argue data-driven
marketing facilitates the tailoring of products and services to better meet the
needs of the end customer.
Precision marketing is a form of data-driven marketing based on
computer algorithms, which can identity patterns in data with implications for
consumer purchasing behaviour. For example, at a simple level, a website
visitor who returns to a site several times within a given period is more likely
to make a purchase than a first-time visitor. At a more complex level,
marketers can arrange to collect internal behavioural and location data, and
bring this together with external third-party data, on customers and
competitors, and other external data to find out where customers are coming
from and how to increase their spending. These new sources of data can also
be incorporated into systems that use artificial intelligence, which learn about
responses and are able to predict customer behaviour even more accurately.
A key benefit of data-driven marketing is agility; marketing activities can
be tuned to react quickly to changes in the environment, for example prices
updated and changed, and marketing messages reshaped (Bibby et al. 2021).
Moreover, greater understanding of how customers behave at each stage of the
buying decision-making process and the touchpoints they interact with on that
customer journey offers great potential for precision marketing to promote
business success (see Figure 6.2). The use of data-driven
marketing and analytics is growing as big data is used more
widely to help firms grow their businesses and increase profitability by
targeting the ‘right’ customers with the ‘right’ products and services, and
become more customer-centric (Grandhi et al. 2020).FIGURE 6.2
Stages in a customer journey and media touchpoints
However, critics argue, close monitoring and following of individuals
online is exploitative and digital marketing practices such as precision
marketing are a form of behavioural control whereby marketers use
sophisticated digital tools and techniques to get around personal privacy to put
forward ‘the offer you can’t refuse’ (Turow et al. 2015). There is an ongoing
debate between those advocating the need to protect consumer sovereignty
versus behavioural economists. Advertisers try to make the case for digital
marketing that it is informative, more relevant and therefore more valuable to
the consumer because it avoids the ‘nuisance factor’ of less relevant non￾tailored marketing messages. Counter to these arguments is the claim that
enhanced capacity to collect, analyse and leverage insights from consumer
data gives greater power to the advertiser, which could ultimately increase
social inequalities and threaten consumer sovereignty (Nadler and McGuigan
2018). There is further discussion of the ethical issues associated with data and
marketing analytics towards the end of this chapter.
Related to data-driven marketing is web analytics, which refers to the
measurement and analysis of how a website (or digital media touchpoint) is
performing in terms of various measurement variables (e.g. visitor numbers,
unique visitors, keyword search terms used to find a site, areas of the site most
frequently visited, time spent on the site, responses to promotions, and more)
(Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick 2022). Google Analytics is a suite of marketing
research solutions that help companies track customer engagement andimprove site visits. Read Mini Case 6.1 to find out more about how analytics
can help and how data capture is changing. Further discussion of digital
analytics and website analysis is provided in Chapters 14 and 15. On the web,
Google has led the way in providing such data and information about how the
web is used.
MINI CASE 6.1
Does Google Track Our Every Move?
Website analysis enables the assessment of site performance and helps to identify key
areas for improvement, such as webpages on a site that are rarely visited or features on the
homepage that are rarely clicked on. In other words, marketing managers can summarize
the actions of visitors to their websites by statistically analysing users’ data. Google
Analytics provides a range of statistics, such as bounce rates, unique visitors, page views
and average time a user spends on a particular site.

Understanding website performance can be important for customer relationship
management strategies, helping to identify areas for improvement that might increase
customer acquisition, conversion, retention and enjoyment during website visits. For
example, a website might include personalized recommendations for loyal customers or
introduce interactive tools to help with product selection.
Sophisticated analytical tools and software applications mean that all eyes are on the
consumer, but marketing managers should be aware that consumers are becoming
increasingly unwilling to hand over their personal data, especially online. In the past,
retailers and consumer-facing brand websites have been able to entice consumers into
signing up to newsletters, surveys and other data capture devices by offering a small
incentive such as discount vouchers for handing over their personal details. However, some
consumers are increasingly reluctant to knowingly hand over personal information. In fact,page 224
research has found that consumers now expect more free information from brand websites
than ever before. Sectors yet to experience this trend are insurance, charities and some
alcoholic drink brands, where consumers are signing up and handing over personal details
in record numbers.
Paradoxically, it is perhaps the increase in our ability to analyse data and make more
meaningful interpretations that is making collecting data from some consumers harder. Part
of the problem is that consumers are concerned about online security and identity fraud.
Google is doing little to alleviate these fears as it integrates more data￾collection methods into its search engine and links together with social media,
encouraging consumers to unwittingly divulge more and more personal details. This means
that consumer profiles can become very transparent and this information can be used for
marketing initiatives. For instance, before you receive your next email marketing message,
the time of day you are most likely to open and respond to the message will have been
analysed, the content of the mailing may have been personalized to suit your preferences,
and sophisticated software will be ready to monitor your next move. If you access the web
using a smartphone, someone somewhere may have read your electronic diary and know
when you are free next week and already be planning which marketing initiatives you are
going to receive. As one of the internet giants, Google provides a very efficient information
search engine for 90 per cent of users in Europe. Google has also been rebuked by the
European Commissioner for Justice over what are seen as weak protection policies for
personal data. EU member states were concerned because Google has made changes that
mean it could pool data about registered users and how they use the web, make video
searches, find map directions and browse the web, and which adverts they click. This
pooling of data means that no stone is left unturned and Google can capture data on every
aspect of an individual’s life and build personalized profiles, which it can then use for its
lucrative Google Ads paid search advertising. The EU has responded with its General Data
Protection (GDPR) legislation, designed to protect privacy and make firms like Amazon,
Google, Facebook and indeed any firms that gather personal data, conform to new and
more restrictive methods of storing and using it. GDPR replaces older data protection
legislation, which has become outdated, and it restricts how personal data is collected,
stored and used.
The Market Research Society’s (MRS’s) Code of Conduct advocates maintaining anonymity
for any opinions deduced from analysing online content, and has guidance on applying
GDPR: www.mrs.org.uk/standards/gdpr-faq.

can be legally stored under GDPR legislation.

Marketing and Research
Market research and marketing research are two terms often used
interchangeably; distinctions can be drawn, but be aware that there is
significant overlap. Marketing research refers to work that explores broader
fundamental issues and/or highly specific areas (e.g. advertising research,
services marketing, changing marketing environment, consumer behaviour),
whereas market research refers to research looking at markets, trends and how
actors (customers) behave. It has a relatively narrow focus, and represents the
process of gathering, analysing and interpreting data. Market research also
tends to be done on a commercial basis, unlike marketing research, which is
more academic. This chapter focuses on the application of market research.
The Market Research Society (MRS) is the UK’s professional body for
research insights and analytics. Its role is to ensure that high standards are
maintained by its members, who carry out market research for many thousands
of organizations. The market research sector has grown by 40 per cent in the
last five years, is worth nearly £7 billion annually in the UK and employs
64,000 people. Recently, the MRS has observed changing requirements in the
industry, with increasing demand for data analytics, storytelling and data
visualization. The focus has shifted towards use of big data, data analytics,
social media analysis, data mining and predictive analytics, qualitative
research, and online and mobile surveys, and away from using survey data
(MRS 2022).
This is an emerging field of data science that combines statistics, computer
science and behavioural science with the aim of extracting meaningful insights
and predicting future outcomes. To achieve this the data used for the analysis
must be good. Poor data quality leads to potentially damaging and inaccurate
outputs. To be sufficiently accurate, data must be free of errors, up to date and
complete (Hazen et al. 2016).
Qualitative and quantitative
An important distinction in market research is between qualitative research
and quantitative research. Qualitative research usually precedes quantitative
research and forms the basis for the understanding of consumers to
aid planning questionnaires, which can then be designed to focus on
what is important to the consumer, and worded in language consumers use andunderstand. However, when the objectives of the research are to gain rich, in￾depth insights into consumer motivations, attitudes and behaviour, the study
may be based on qualitative research alone without the quantitative follow-up.
Whichever approach is taken, there are several essential differences
between these two key primary data-gathering methods, which means that the
skills required vary. Indeed, many market research practitioners specialize in
one or the other approach. These differences relate to the research purpose and
whether it is to gather verbal or numerical data. Qualitative research can
provide deep insights into consumer behaviour, whereas the purpose of
quantitative research is to provide information that can be generalized across
the study population.
Also, the methods used for data collection tend to be different. Qualitative
data are often gathered through focus groups and in-depth interviews, whereas
quantitative data is gathered using a structured questionnaire. Qualitative
methods offer more flexibility than quantitative studies, as questions can be
varied to some degree, depending on the answers given by a respondent.
Although a structured questionnaire can provide the means for varying
questions through the use of filter questions (e.g. ‘If the answer to question 6 is
yes, go to question 7, if no go to question 10’), there is much less flexibility to
vary the questions at the discretion of the interviewer.
It is also important to note that sample sizes differ. Qualitative methods
such as in-depth interviews and focus groups have a higher cost per respondent
and so tend to focus on insight rather than statistical precision, which means
that qualitative studies are associated with smaller samples than quantitative
research. Quantitative studies can involve thousands of people. For example,
OnePoll conducts surveys on a local, national or international scale, using
tailor-made surveys, teams of researchers and selected relevant participants. A
typical qualitative study, however, may involve fewer than 30 people.
Analysis and presentation of results can also vary. Qualitative data is
analysed using content analysis, which can result in a report that provides
summary statements and uses quotes from research respondents. Quantitative
survey data is approached by statistical analysis, and reporting back is by
means of graphs, tables and other methods of statistical presentation. In both
cases, careful interpretation is required.
The Market Research ProcessMany firms wanting to conduct market research outsource the work to a
specialist company. But it is important for marketers to be aware of how to
identify an appropriate company to be able to commission good research,
which can be used to inform corporate and marketing decision-making (MRS
2018). Both large and small firms commission market research studies as the
insights and evidence produced can help with development of new products
and increase customer retention, developing more effective advertising
campaigns.
This section presents a framework for understanding the main steps in the
marketing research process, shown in Figure 6.3. This ‘map’ highlights what is
involved in a major marketing research study covering both qualitative and
quantitative research.
FIGURE 6.3
Overview of the market research processpage 226
Research planning
Decisions made at the research planning stage will fundamentally affect what
is done later, so planning is required prior to any data collection. A commercial
marketing research project is likely to involve marketing management at the
client company, internal marketing research staff and, usually, research staff at
an outside marketing research agency. The discussion that follows provides a
generic view of the commercial marketing research process.
Initial contactThe start of the process is usually the realization that a marketing problem (e.g.
a new product or advertising decision) requires information to help find a
solution. Marketing management may contact internal marketing research staff
or an outside agency. Let us assume that the research requires the assistance of
a marketing research agency. A meeting will be arranged to discuss the nature
of the problem and the client’s research needs.
Research brief
At the meeting with the marketing research agency, the client will explain the
marketing problem and outline the research objectives. The marketing problem
might be to attract new customers to a product line, and the research objectives
could be to identify groups of customers (market segments) that might have a
use for the product, and the characteristics of the product that appeal to them
most. The key point is that clients should tell research agencies not only what
they want to understand but also what the research will be used for (Dye
2008).
Other information that should be provided for the research agency includes
the following (Crouch and Housden 2003):
Background information: the product’s history and the competitive situation.
Sources of information: the client may have a list of industries that might be
potential users of the product. This helps the researchers to define the scope
of the research.
The scale of the project: is the client looking for a ‘cheap and cheerful’ job
or a major study? This has implications for the research design and survey
costs.
The timetable: when is the information required?
The client should produce a specific written research brief for the research
agency prior to meeting, so that the agency can produce a research proposal.
The research brief should state the client’s requirements and should be in
written form to minimize misunderstandings. In the event of a dispute later in
the process, the research brief (and proposal) form the benchmark against
which any grievances can be settled.
Commissioning good research is like buying any other product or service.
If marketing managers can agree on why the research is needed, what it will be
used for, when it is needed and how much they are willing to pay for it, they
are likely to make a good buy.page 227
Four suggestions for buying good research are as follows:
1. Define terms clearly. For example, if market share information is required,
the term ‘market’ should be clearly defined.
2. Beware of researchers who bend research problems so that they can use
their favourite technique. They may be specialists in a particular research￾gathering method (e.g. group discussion) or statistical technique (e.g. factor
or cluster analysis) and look for ways of using these methods no matter what
research problem they face. This can lead to irrelevant information and
unnecessary expense.
3. Do not be put off by seemingly naive researchers who ask what appear to be
simple questions, particularly if they are new to the client’s industry.
4. Brief two or three agencies. The extra time involved should be rewarded by
better feedback on how to tackle the research problem and a better-priced
quote.
Research proposal
The research proposal defines what the marketing research agency promises to
do for its client, and how much it will cost. Like the research brief, the
proposal should be written to avoid misunderstandings. A client should expect
the following to be included:
A statement of objectives: to demonstrate an understanding of the client’s
marketing and research problems.
What will be done: an unambiguous description of the research design,
including the survey method, the type of sample, the sample size and how
the fieldwork will be controlled.
Timetable: if and when a report will be produced.
Costs: how much the research will cost and what, specifically, is/is not
being included in those costs.
When assessing proposals, a client might usefully check the following
points:
Beware of vagueness: if the proposal is vague, assume that the report is also
likely to be vague. If the agency does not state what is going to be done,
why, who is doing it and when, assume that it is not clear in its own mind
about these important issues.Beware of jargon: there is no excuse for jargon-ridden proposals. Marketing
research terminology can be explained in non-expert language, so it is the
responsibility of the agency to make the proposal understandable to the
client.
Beware of what is missing: assume that anything not specified will not be
provided. For example, if no mention of a presentation is made in the
proposal, assume it will not take place. Any doubts, ask the agency.
Exploratory research
Exploratory research involves the preliminary exploration of a research area
prior to the main data-collection stage. The discussion that follows assumes
that the initial proposal has been accepted and that exploratory research is to
be carried out as the basis for survey design.
A major purpose of exploratory research is to guard against the sins of
omission and admission (Wright and Crimp 2003):
Sin of omission: not researching a topic in enough detail or failing to
provide sufficient respondents in a group to allow meaningful analysis.
Sin of admission: collecting data that are irrelevant to the marketing
problem or using too many groups for analysis purposes and thereby
unnecessarily increasing the sample size.
Exploratory research techniques allow the researcher to understand the
people who are to be interviewed in the main data-collection stage, and the
market that is being researched. The main survey stage can thus be designed
with this knowledge in mind rather than being based on the researcher’s ill￾informed prejudices and guesswork.
Figure 6.4 displays the four exploratory research activities. An individual
research project may involve all or some of them.
FIGURE 6.4
Forms of exploratory researchpage 228
Please note that qualitative and quantitative research methods may be used
at both the exploratory and main data-collection stage and it will be the market
research project manager’s responsibility to determine which methods will best
meet the research objectives.
Secondary research
Secondary research is so called because the data come to the researcher
‘second-hand’ (other people have compiled the data). When the researcher
actively collects new data–for example, by interviewing respondents–this is
called primary research (discussed in the next section).
Secondary data come from sources such as internal company records,
reports and previous research carried out for the company. External sources of
secondary data include: government and European Union (EU) statistics;
publishers of reports and directories on markets, countries and industries; trade
associations; banks; and newspapers, magazines and journals.
The internet provides access to rich sources of secondary information.
Websites like Trendwatching (www.trendwatching.com) specialize in
identifying emerging global consumer and marketing trends. Some online
sources are free to access, others are paid-for services. For example, IDC,
Gartner and Experian have an internet presence and provide both free and
paid-for resources. Research firms specializing in providing secondary
information also provide electronic content either by subscription or by selling
individual reports. For example, a visit to the website of Mintel–the world’s
leading market intelligence agency (www.mintel.com)–can provide hundredsof industry reports from the very specific, such as on innovations in German
barbecues, to broader subjects such as personal health and beauty care. A word
of caution when using online resources (especially free information):
remember to verify the authenticity of the data; be critical of the findings and
establish the origin of the data.
In the EU, there are many secondary sources of data. Examples include:
Euromonitor–industry reports (www.euromonitor.com), Kompass–competitor
information (http://gb.kompass.com) and European statistics
(http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat). These and other resources can supply
information for specific industries, details of market competitors and economic
trend statistics.
Secondary research should be carried out before primary research. Without
the former, an expensive primary research survey might be commissioned to
provide information that is already available from secondary sources.
Primary research methods
Each ad hoc marketing research project may be different. This is to fit the
particular requirements and resources of various clients. For example, one
study may focus on qualitative research using small numbers of respondents,
while another may be largely quantitative research, involving the interviewing
of hundreds or thousands of consumers. Therefore, it is important to take care
to ensure that the data-collection method is suitable and best able to meet the
objectives of the market research activity.
Qualitative research
Qualitative research has been defined as ‘the analysis and understanding of
patterned conduct and social process of society’ (Denzin and Lincoln 2000).
The main forms of qualitative research used in market research, which help us
to understand the complex patterns of human behaviour, are group discussions,
and in-depth interviews and ethnography, which involve bringing together
personal encounters, life events and understandings into a more meaningful
context (Tedlock 2000). Qualitative research aims to establish customers’
attitudes, values, behaviour and beliefs, and to understand consumers in a way
that traditional methods of interviewing people using questionnaires cannot.
Qualitative research seeks to understand the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of consumerpage 229
behaviour (Clegg 2001). The key differences between qualitative and
quantitative research are explored later in this chapter.
Focus groups involve unstructured or semi-structured discussions between
a moderator, or group leader, who is often a psychologist, and a group of
consumers. The moderator has a list of areas to cover within the topic, but
allows the group considerable freedom to discuss the issues that are important
to them. The topics might be organic foods, men’s cosmetics, motor sports or
activity holiday pursuits. By arranging groups of 6–12 people to discuss their
beliefs, attitudes, motivation, behaviour and preferences, a good deal of
knowledge may be gained about the consumer. This can be helpful when
planning questionnaires, which can then be designed to focus on what is
important to the respondent (as opposed to the researcher) and worded in
language that the respondent uses and understands.
A further advantage of the focus group is that the findings may provide
rich insights into consumer motivations and behaviour because of the group
dynamics where group members ‘feed off’ one another and reveal ideas that
would not have arisen on a one-to-one basis. Such findings may be used as
food for thought for marketers, without the need for quantitative follow-up.
The weaknesses of the focus group are that interpretation of the results is
highly subjective, the quality of the results depends heavily on the skills of the
moderator, sample size is usually small, making generalization to wider
populations difficult, and there exists the danger that the results
might be biased by the presence of ‘research groupies’, who
enjoy taking part in focus groups and return again and again. Such people
sometimes take on different identities, skewing survey results, and have led the
Association of Qualitative Research Practitioners to introduce a rule which
says that focus group participants must provide proof of identity each time
they attend a group (Flack 2002).
Technology is impacting on such face-to-face discussion settings and high￾tech labs can be used which allow participants to be observed through two-way
glass, enabling the client organization to view the focus group session live.
Online focus groups are also becoming popular, and this method can reduce
costs and create more opportunities to interact with customer groups. Also,
research has found that, in some cases, participants are more honest in online
discussions than face to face.
Online communities and social media sites can provide access to
‘communities of interests’, which can take the form of chat rooms or websites
dedicated to specific interests or issues. These are useful forums forconducting focus groups, or at least identifying suitable participants. Questions
can be posed to participants who are not under time pressure to respond. This
can lead to richer insights since they can think deeply about questions put to
them online. Another advantage is that they can comprise people located all
over the world at minimal cost.
In-depth interviews involve the interviewing of consumers individually for
perhaps one or two hours about a topic. The aims are broadly similar to those
of group discussion but are used when the presence of other people could
inhibit honest answers and viewpoints, when the topic requires individual
treatment, as when discussing an individual’s decision-making process, and
where the organization of a group is not feasible (e.g. it might prove
impossible to arrange for six busy purchasing managers to come together for a
group discussion).
Care should be taken when interpreting the results of qualitative research
in that the findings are usually based on small sample sizes, and the more
interesting or surprising viewpoints may be disproportionately reported. This is
particularly significant when qualitative research is not followed by a
quantitative study.
Consultation with experts
Qualitative research is based on discussions and interviews with actual and
potential buyers of a brand or service. However, consultation with experts
involves interviewing people who may not form part of the target market, but
who, nevertheless, can provide important marketing-related insights. Many
industries have their experts in universities, financial institutions and the press,
who may be willing to share their knowledge. They can provide invaluable
background information and can be useful for predicting future trends and
developments.
Observation
Observation can also help in exploratory research when the product field is
unfamiliar. For example, watching people buy wine in a supermarket or paint
in a DIY store may provide useful background knowledge when planning a
survey in these markets. Another form of observational research that focuses
on employee performance is mystery shopping. The ‘shopper’ acts like any
other customer in visiting a store, but is trained to ask particular questions andpage 230
to assess performance on such criteria as service time, friendliness and product
knowledge. The objective is to identify service weaknesses and strengths, and
to provide input into staff training.
Ethnography Ethnography is a form of observation that involves detailed
and prolonged observation of (in the context of this book) consumers. Its
origins are in social anthropology, where researchers live in a studied society
for months or years. Consumer researchers usually make their observations
more quickly and use a range of methods, including direct observations,
interviews, and video and audio recordings (Peter et al. 1999).
This method of data collection has become popular as it connects
important personal experiences to specific contexts (Tedlock 2000), and
enables researchers to get closer to consumers in order to understand their
behaviour in new and more detailed ways. Such research investigates how
people behave in their own environment and interact with the world around
them. Unlike focus groups, where consumers are brought to the researcher,
ethnography takes the researcher to the consumer. Advocates of this form of
research argue that focus groups provide only part of the story and do not yield
the kinds of ‘consumer insights’ that ethnography can.
Procter & Gamble has embraced ethnographic research and improved
understanding of customers. Using a panel of families in the UK and Italy, the
FMCG manufacturer studied people who buy Procter & Gamble products such
as Max Factor cosmetics, Ariel washing powder and Pampers nappies, to gain
valuable insights into people’s habits. The findings had implications for
product design, packaging and promotion. For example, it was ethnographic
research that revealed the nappy was not as important as Procter & Gamble
had previously thought. New mothers were more interested in information and
knowledge than nappies. Using these consumer insights, Procter & Gamble
launched Pampers.com, an online community for mothers that attracts more
than 650,000 users across Europe. It has also used ethnographic research in
China, where it observed low-income consumers doing their washing and
found that they were prepared to do the extra hand washing needed to
compensate for water hardness. Procter & Gamble’s response was to launch a
cut-price version of its China Tide detergent without water softener (ESOMAR
2005). A Procter & Gamble spokesperson pointed out that ethnography willnot replace other forms of research and those ethical issues concerning privacy
are dealt with by getting full permission beforehand and giving the families
complete editorial control over what is eventually shown to the marketing
team.
The objective of ethnographic research is to bridge the gap between what
people say they do and what they actually do. The Ford Motor Company used
ethnographic research, whereby researchers lived and travelled with drivers to
discover what customers wanted in their cars (Peterson 2015). Now read
Marketing in Action 6.2 to discover how digital mobile ethnography has been
used to find out the emotional roles that mothers play in family lives.
MARKETING IN ACTION 6.2
Mobile Ethnography Reveals Motherhood is Not a Job
Mobile technology has brought innovation to ethnographic research and enables research
teams to get even closer to people’s lives by observing their actions in real time. For
example, Mumsnet and Saatchi & Saatchi teamed up to study mothers to find out more
about the roles they play in the family, the relationships they have with their children and the
implications for marketing. The mobile ethnographic study was conducted over a week with
a representative sample of 1,022 mothers in the UK. The aim was to gain in-depth
understanding about the mother’s role, and her home and personal environment.Source: Bakhtiar Zein/Shutterstock
The study revealed eight emotional roles that mothers assume when caring for their
families. These roles were created from 35 emotions that were identified in the ethnographic
study (examples of which are shown in Table 6.1).
TABLE 6.1 Emotional roles adopted by mothers in their daily lives

herself and her family
The marketing implications for the research are that, if brands find ways to enable mothers
to spend more time with their families, this is seen as an important potential benefit. Another
finding from the study is that mothers would like to spend more time having fun with their
children rather than just being providers of entertainment. While mothers are primary carers
in the family unit, with 58 per cent saying they take on the majority of the parenting role,
they would like more time to ‘break the rules’, and to have the freedom to let go and have
fun. Further research has revealed price-cutting can increase engagement with brands. But
mums are more likely to return if there is an element of gamification of their brand
experiences, which works by capturing shoppers’ attention.
Based on: Burrows (2014); Saatchi & Saatchi (2015); Vince (2015)
The objective of the exploratory research stage in the marketing research
process is not to form conclusions but to get better acquainted with the market
and its customers. This allows the researcher to base the next stage, which
involves wider data collection, on informed assumptions rather than
guesswork.
The main data-collection stage
Following careful exploratory research, the design of the main data-collection
procedures will be made.
In Figure 6.5, the assumption is quantitative research methods are the most
appropriate. However, in some situations, it may be better to extend the use of
qualitative research methods at the exploratory stage of a project. In either case
it is important to select the data-collection methods most likely to achieve the
research objectives.page 232
FIGURE 6.5
Types of quantitative data-collection
At the main data-collection stage, two alternative approaches are
descriptive research and experimental research.
Assuming the main data-collection stage requires interviewing, the
research design will be based on the following factors:
who and how many people to interview (the sampling process)
how to interview them (the survey method)
what questions to ask (questionnaire design).
Figure 6.5 displays the two types of approach and the three research design
methods associated with the main quantitative data-collection stage.
These research approaches and methods will now be examined.
Descriptive research
Descriptive research may be undertaken to describe consumers’ beliefs,
attitudes, preferences, behaviour, etc. For example, a survey into advertising
effectiveness might measure awareness of the brand, recall of the
advertisement and knowledge about its content.Experimental research
The aim of experimental research is to establish cause and effect. Experimental
research involves setting up control procedures to isolate the impact of a factor
(e.g. a money-off sales promotion) on a dependent variable (e.g. sales).
The key to successful experimental design is the elimination of other
explanations of changes in the dependent variable. One way of doing this is to
use random sampling. For example, the sales promotion might be applied in a
random selection of stores, with the remaining stores selling the brand without
the money-off offer. Statistical significance testing can be used to test whether
differences in sales are likely to be caused by the sales promotion or are simply
random variations. The effects of other influences on sales are assumed to
impact randomly on both the sales promotion and the no-promotion
alternatives.
The sampling process
Figure 6.6 outlines the sampling process, beginning with defining the
population–that is, the group forming the subject of study in a particular
survey. The survey objective will be to provide results that are representative
of this group. Sampling planners, for example, must ask questions like: ‘Do we
interview all people over the age of 18 or restrict it to those of the population
aged 18–60?’ and ‘Do we interview purchasing managers in all textile
companies or only those that employ more than 200 people?’
FIGURE 6.6
The sampling processpage 233
Once the population is defined, the next step is to search for a sampling
frame–that is, a list or other records of the chosen population from which a
sample can be selected. Examples include a register of electors or the Kompass
directory of companies. The result determines whether a random
or non-random sample can be chosen. A random sample requires
an accurate sampling frame; without one, the researcher is restricted to non￾random methods.
Three major sampling methods are simple random sampling, stratified
random sampling and quota sampling. It is also important to determine sample
size.
With simple random sampling, each individual (or company) in the
sampling frame is given a number, and numbers are drawn at random (by
chance) until the sample is complete. The sample is random because
everyone on the list has an equal chance of selection.
With stratified random sampling, the population is broken down into groups
(e.g. by company size or industry) and a random sample is drawn (as above)
for each group. This ensures that each group is represented in the sample.
With quota sampling, a sampling frame does not exist but the percentage of
the population that falls in various groupings (e.g. gender, social class, age)
is known. The sample is constructed by asking interviewers to select
individuals on the basis of these percentages, for example roughly 50:50
females to males. This is a non-random method since not everyone has an
equal chance of selection, but it is much less expensive than random
methods when the population is widely dispersed.Sample size is a further key consideration when attempting to generate a
representative sample. Clearly, the larger the sample size the more likely it
is that it will represent the population. Statistical theory allows the
calculation of sampling error (i.e. the error caused by not interviewing
everyone in the population) for various sample sizes. In practice, the number
of people interviewed is based on a balance between sampling error and cost
considerations. Fortunately, sample sizes of around 1,000 (or fewer) can
provide measurements with tolerable error levels when representing
populations counted in their millions.
Data-collection methods: interviews and surveys
There are two basic methods of gathering data: personal interviews and non￾personal surveys. Personal interviews, where there is direct contact between
interviewer and interviewee, may be face to face, by telephone or through
online video. Non-personal survey contact is through impersonal media–
online, mail/email or mobile phone. Each method has different techniques,
with particular strengths and limitations.
Face-to-face and video interviews
A major advantage of face-to-face interviews is response rates are generally
higher than for telephone interviews (Yu and Cooper 1983). Seemingly, the
personal element in the contact makes refusal less likely, which is an important
factor when considering the representativeness of the sample population. Face￾to-face interviews are more versatile than telephone, for example visual aids
(e.g. a drawing of a new product concept) can be used, where clearly they
cannot in the case of a telephone interview. The use of many open-ended
questions can be effective when interviewing, although time restrictions for a
telephone interview can limit their use. Probing is easier with face-to-face
interviews. Two types of probes are clarifying probes (e.g. ‘Can you explain
what you mean by …?’), which help the interviewer understand exactly what
the interviewee is saying, and exploratory probes, which stimulate the
interviewee to give a full answer (e.g. ‘Are there any other reasons why …?’).
A certain degree of probing can be achieved with a telephone interview, but
time pressure and the less personalized situation will inevitably limit its use.
Limitations of face-to-face interviews are they are more expensive than
telephone and mail questionnaires. Telephone interviews are cheaper as thepage 234
cost of contacting respondents is less expensive, unless the population is very
concentrated (face-to-face interviewing of students on a business studies
course, for instance, would be relatively inexpensive). The presence of an
interviewer can cause bias (e.g. socially desirable answers) and lead to the
misreporting of sensitive information.
In some ways telephone interviews are a halfway house between face-to￾face and mail surveys. Telephone interviews generally have a higher response
rate than mail questionnaires, but lower than face-to-face interviews; their cost
is usually less than face-to-face, but higher than for mail surveys; and allow a
degree of flexibility when interviewing. However, there are limits to the
number of questions that can be asked before respondents either terminate the
interview or give quick (invalid) answers to speed up the process. The use of
computer-aided telephone interviewing (CATI) is common, as is automated
computer telephone interviewing (ACTI). Centrally located interviewers read
questions from a computer monitor and input answers via a keyboard. Routing
through the questionnaire is computer-controlled, helping the process of
interviewing. B2B International is a full-service MR firm that
uses CATI for many of its studies for clients around the globe,
such as Envirotainer, a transportation company, wanting to find out about
desirable new features for its storage containers. The firm was pleased with the
results of the telephone interviews carried out by B2B International in 20
countries using nine different languages as they enabled it to introduce
innovative and groundbreaking features to its Releye containers (B2B
International 2022).
Online video interviews via the web offer a solution to get over some of the
issues of face-to-face and telephone interviews and focus groups. Clients can
set research objectives and then view the results, which can gather detailed
behavioural data. Companies like Virgin America, Dell and Microsoft have
used this form of interviewing to gain deep insight into their customers’ needs
when developing new products.
Online and mobile surveys
Digital data gathering is increasing in popularity. Surveys represent a lower￾cost option than interviewing, can be used to reach a widely dispersed
population, and can be delivered in a variety of ways, for example via the web
and by email and mobile phone. However, the major problem is the potentialfor low response rates and the accompanying danger of an unrepresentative
sample.
Digital platforms (web and mobile) are increasingly used to conduct survey
research. With digital surveys, the questionnaire is administered through a
virtual platform by registering key words, or it appears in banner advertising
on search engines such as Yahoo! or Google, which drive people to the
questionnaire. Mobile devices can also be used. Digital surveys have grown in
popularity to such an extent that they now account for a significant proportion
of all the quantitative data collected in Europe and the US. There are now
many bespoke online survey and poll companies, for example Survey Monkey
(www.surveymonkey.com) and eSurveysPro (www.esurveyspro.com), which
provide survey tools and methods of analysis.
Major advantages of digital marketing research platforms are:
flexibility of content–visual aids such as video and graphics can be used, as
well as audio input
reach–there are no geographical limitations
speed of delivery
automated digital data collection–data sets are readily available in digital
format for analysis
potential cost savings.
However, the more complex the survey–for example, when it includes
video and interactive experiments–the higher the cost of production. So, while
these digital techniques can be highly flexible, the size of the survey should be
taken into consideration when evaluating the relative cost. Sampling problems
are a potential disadvantage, as they can arise from the skewed nature of
internet users (if the online target populations are from younger and more
affluent groups in society), although this issue is becoming less important as
the global internet user population increases.
In summary, it is suggested that digital surveys are faster, easier, cheaper
and better. However, research has found that the benefits do not come in equal
quantities when compared with other survey tools. For example:
Digital surveys are faster to distribute than mail surveys, but telephone
surveys can provide the most instantaneous response.
Digital surveys may be easier to compile and use, but this will be subjective
as it depends on the technological literacy of those involved.
Digital surveys may be cheaper in terms of sample size, as the larger the
sample the greater the cost of the other methods of data collection, but therepage 235
can be significant up-front costs involved in setting up a digital survey and
accessing the desired target respondents.
To be better than other survey tools, digital surveys need to ensure the
validity of response.
An absence of accurate contact lists remains a problem when using email
to survey populations. Even when lists can be found, researchers need to tread
very carefully, as ‘spamming’–sending junk mail–is seen as very offensive by
most email users and messages may be blocked by firewalls and therefore
never get to the recipient’s mailbox. A possible way to reap the benefits and
counter the problems associated with digital surveys is to use a mixed-method
approach that allows for different modes of data collection to be used, to
address validity issues. The use of two methods will, however, slow the survey
process and increase costs, but should ensure greater validity in the findings,
which is one of the fundamentals when using survey data to make strategic and
tactical marketing decisions (Gigliotti 2011).
Questionnaire design
Three conditions are necessary to get a true response to a question:
1. Respondents must understand the question.
2. Respondents must be able to provide the information.
3. Respondents must be willing to answer.
Researchers must remember these conditions when designing
questionnaires. Questions need to be phrased in a language the respondent
understands and is able to interpret. Equally, researchers must not ask about
issues that respondents cannot remember or that are outside their experience.
For example, it would be invalid to ask about attitudes towards a brand of
which the respondent is unaware. Finally, researchers need to consider the best
way to elicit sensitive or personal information. As we have already seen,
willingness to provide such information depends on the survey method
employed.
Figure 6.7 shows the three stages in the development of the questionnaire:
planning, design and pilot.FIGURE 6.7
Stages in the development of a questionnaire
Source: Kotler et al. (1977)
The planning stage provides a firm foundation for designing a
questionnaire that will deliver relevant information for the marketing problem
that is being addressed.
The design stage involves several interrelated issues:
Ordering of topics: an effective questionnaire has a logical flow. Start with
easy-to-answer questions. This helps to build the confidence of respondents
and allows them to relax. Respondents are often anxious at the beginning of
an interview, concerned about showing their ignorance. Other rules of
thumb are simply common sense, for example ask awareness questions
before attitude measurement questions, and not vice versa. Unaided
awareness questions must be asked before aided ones. Classificatory
questions that ask for personal information such as age and occupation are
usually asked last.page 236
Types of question: closed questions specify the range of answers to be
recorded. If there are only two possible answers (e.g. ‘Did you visit a
cinema within the last seven days?’ YES/NO) the question is dichotomous
(either/or). If there are more than two possible answers, then the question is
multiple choice (e.g. ‘Which, if any, of the following cinemas have you
visited within the last seven days?’ Odeon, Vue, Cineworld, None). Open￾ended questions allow respondents to answer the question in their own
words (e.g. ‘What did you like about the cinema you visited?’). The
interviewer then writes the answer in a space on the questionnaire.
Wording and instructions: great care needs to be taken in the wording of
questions. Questionnaire designers need to guard against ambiguity, leading
questions, asking two questions in one and using unfamiliar words. Table
6.2 gives some examples of poorly worded questions and suggests remedies.
Instructions should be printed in capital letters or underlined so that they are
easily distinguishable from questions.
Layout: the questionnaire should not appear cluttered. In mail
questionnaires, it is a mistake to squeeze too many questions onto
one page to shorten the questionnaire length (in pages). Response is likely to
be lower if the questionnaire appears heavy than if its page length is
extended (Jobber 1985).
Scaling: careful exploratory research may allow attitudes and beliefs to be
measured by means of scales. Respondents are given lists of statements (e.g.
‘My company’s marketing information system allows me to make better
decisions’) followed by a choice of five positions on a scale ranging from
‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’. Furthermore, computer advances are
enabling the measurement of emotions using avatars (pictorial
representations of people).
Probes and prompts: probes seek to explore or clarify what a respondent has
said. Following a question about awareness of brand names, the exploratory
probe ‘Any others?’ would seek to identify further names. Sometimes
respondents use vague words or phrases like, ‘I like going on holiday
because it is nice.’A clarifying probe such as, ‘In what way is it nice?’
would seek a more meaningful response. Prompts, on the other hand, aid
responses to a question. For example, in an aided-recall question, a list of
brand names would be provided for the respondent.
Coding: by using closed questions the interviewer merely has to draw a ring
around the code number next to the respondent’s choice of answer. In
computer-assisted telephone interviewing, and with the increasing use oflaptop computers for face-to-face interviewing, the appropriate code number
can be keyed directly into the computer’s memory. Such questionnaires are
pre-coded, making the process of interviewing and data analysis much
simpler. Open-ended questions, however, require the interviewer to write
down the answer verbatim. This necessitates post-coding, whereby answers
are categorized after the interview. This can be a time-consuming and
laborious task.
TABLE 6.2 Poorly worded questions and how to avoid them
Question Problem and solution
What type of wine do you
prefer?
‘Type’ is ambiguous; respondents could say ‘French’, ‘red’,
‘claret’, depending on their interpretation. Showing the
respondent a list and asking ‘from this list …’ would avoid the
problem.
Do you think that prices are
cheaper at Asda than at
Aldi?
Leading question favouring Asda; a better question would be
‘Do you think that prices at Asda are higher, lower or about the
same as at Aldi?’ Names should be reversed for half of the
sample.
Which is more powerful and
kind to your hands: Ariel or
Bold?
Two questions in one: Ariel may be more powerful, but Bold
may be kinder to the hands. Ask the two questions separately.
Do you find it paradoxical
that X lasts longer and yet
is cheaper than Y?
Unfamiliar word: a study has shown that less than a quarter of
the population understand such words as ‘paradoxical’,
‘chronological’ and ‘facility’. Test understanding before use.
Once the preliminary questionnaire has been designed, it should be piloted
with a representative subsample to test for faults. The pilot stage is not the
same as exploratory research. Exploratory research helps to decide upon the
research design, whereas piloting tests the questionnaire design and helps to
estimate costs. Face-to-face piloting, where respondents are asked to answer
questions and comment on any problems concerning a questionnaire read out
by an interviewer, is preferable to impersonal piloting, where the questionnaire
is given to respondents for self-completion and they are asked to write down
any problems found (Reynolds and Diamantopoulos 1998). If desired, several
kinds of question on the same topic can be asked to assess the effects of the
wording on respondents (Sigman 2001). Once the pilot work proves
satisfactory, the final questionnaire can be administered to the chosen sample.page 237
Digital technology is now widely used in the research process but, as
discussed throughout this chapter, the difference is big data is collected
automatically and used to provide companies with business intelligence
informing marketing decision-making. Now read Marketing in Action 6.3 to
find out how GSK uses big data to inform decision-making.
MARKETING IN ACTION 6.3
What is Big Data? GSK Shares Its Big Data
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is a company making use of big data from end-to-end of the supply
chain by sharing its data with the world. This multinational pharmaceutical firm has a
portfolio of brands stretching from prescription medicines like Amoxil and Betnovate cream
to consumer healthcare brands including Aquafresh, Beechams and Sensodyne. Marketing
research comes in many forms because of the nature of the business–carrying out clinical
trials and research associated with bringing healthcare products to the market. However,
when it comes to the analysis of consumer data, GSK has invested in its marketing
research operation to ensure collection and dissemination of findings happen at a company￾wide level. The company has experts in every area of the business who
concentrate on specific marketing research problems. It has taken the very
bold step of sharing its data with outsiders, and has posted more than 450 studies online.
This transparency and openness is a strategic move that aims to benefit the industry and
humankind by enabling faster innovations through collaboration.

In the organization, it is felt that the most useful information is generated when experts work
together on common goals, gathering data from large, complex data sources, includinginternal data and online sources, and from weblogs, social media, web and smartphone
analytics, through which consumers provide signals about what they are thinking at a given
point in time. GSK works with companies providing data management services to help its
clients reach a better understanding of their own customers. Ultimately, GSK aims to build
relationships with more than a million of its customers through social media, and to use
these relationships as a base for market research and for multichannel marketing. Data
collection takes place when customers are directed to targeted offers and promotions for
brand websites, where external data are integrated with existing internal data. The process
involves tracking a brand and analysing what customers are saying and thinking specifically
about it. The process also involves looking at everything else the customers are talking
about (in areas of public access) to build a consumer profile. GSK then employs internal
data management and processing analysts to make sense of the data, and uses the
information to inform its marketing strategy and planning at both strategic and tactical
levels.
Capacity to analyse and use data is constantly developing and GSK is using artificial
intelligence (AI) systems to deliver transformational changes to the way it does things and
bring new products to market much faster.

Report writing, presentation and visualization
The key elements in a research report are:
1. title page
2. list of contents
3. preface (outline of agreed brief, statement of objectives, scope and methods
of research)
4. summary of conclusions and recommendations
5. previous related research (how previous research has had a bearing on this
research)
6. research method
7. research findings
8. conclusions
9. appendices.
Sections 1–4 provide a concise description of the nature and outcomes of
the research for busy managers. Sections 5–9 provide the level of detail
necessary if any particular issue (e.g. the basis of a finding or the analytical
technique used) needs checking. The report should be written in language the
reader will understand; jargon should be avoided.page 238
Visualization software packages such as PowerPoint considerably ease the
production of pie charts, histograms, graphs, and so on, for use in the report or
for presentational purposes (such as the production of acetates for overhead
projection). Clients are increasingly asking for live discussions in which ideas
are thought about and the implications for marketing decisions discussed.
Some agencies recommend the use of workshops following the presentation of
results, to encourage this kind of discussion (Dye 2008) (see Figure 6.8).

Ethical Issues in Marketing Research,
Analytics and Customer Insightspage 239
Good ethical practices are important for business success, maintaining trusted
long-term relationships with customers and retaining brand reputations.
Despite good intentions, sometimes firms get things wrong, and doing the
‘right thing’ is becoming increasingly difficult with more widespread use of
human collaboration with digital technologies. As firms automate marketing
practices, using AI and related technologies to remain competitive, it is
important to find ways to avoid ethical issues that misuse data and information
(Behera et al. 2022). Ethical issues to consider in the context of data analytics
and marketing research include the following.
Data privacy
Data privacy is a high priority for online shoppers and so firms must be aware
of concerns if they are to develop trusting relationships with customers (Wang
et al. 2020). Many consumers recognize the positive role marketing research
plays in the provision of goods and services, but some resent the intrusive
nature of marketing research surveys. While most surveys ask respondents to
indicate an age and income band rather than requesting specific figures, some
people feel that this is an invasion of their privacy. Others object to receiving
unsolicited telephone calls, dislike being stopped in the street to be asked to
complete a face-to-face survey, and resent online surveys and email
questionnaires.
The right of individuals to privacy is incorporated in the guidelines of
many research associations. For example, a code of conduct of the European
Society for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR 2018) states ‘No
information which could be used to identify informants, either directly or
indirectly, shall be revealed other than to research personnel within the
researchers’ own organization who require this knowledge for the
administration and checking of interviews and data processing.’
Facebook, Best Buy and other brands have suffered from ethical
infringements relating to data privacy. Facebook was fined by the Federal
Trade Commission for improperly obtaining data from millions of users of its
social media platform and then selling the data to another firm. This was not an
isolated incident as other firms had extracted personal data from
the social media platform’s infrastructure without authorization.
The events were considered a ‘breach of trust’ by users, so there was financial
loss in the shape of fines, as well as reputational damage for Facebook
(Baraniuk 2019).Collaborations, partnerships and contracted-out services that use and
exchange personal customer data are potential sources of data privacy
breaches, and secure data management is required to protect data. Best Buy
uses live chat via phone, computer and tablet to enhance its customer service
experience, but contracts a third-party intermediary to handle this part of its
service. However, problems arose when the contracted company suffered an
attack from hackers, who illegally harvested Best Buy’s customers’ payment
and credit card information.
Personalization
Combining digital technology and personal information to generate tailored
messages is a widespread practice in modern marketing. While, on the one
hand, getting the messaging close to an individual’s interests, needs and wants
sounds ideal, on the other hand when does this data-driven type of marketing
overstep the mark? Some health insurance firms calculate individual risk
scores based on each individual’s specific behaviour, generated from collecting
behavioural and continuous data using smartphone apps (Meyers and Van
Hoyweghen 2018). Continuous driving data is gathered by devices on-board
cars, and used to set the rate of driver insurance (Barry and Charpentier 2020).
The dark side of customer analytics
Marketers increasingly gather data using digital tools, emails, online surveys
and social media, with the aim of better understanding customers and to
increase the efficiency of their marketing spend (Guttmann 2019). Customer
analytics are used to increase response rates, strengthen customer loyalty,
boost sales and identify unsatisfied customers (who can then be targeted with
marketing messages). But consumers are often unaware of what data are being
collected, how their data are used and who is collecting the data (Goi 2021).
Facebook and Google use personalized algorithms to reduce information
overload, but operate without the knowledge or control of the end user whose
data is collected and manipulated. Cloud computing services enable the
outsourcing of computer storage and data centres, which moves data further
out of reach of the user who originally generated it (Timmermans et al. 2011).
Misuse of market research findingspage 240
When market research findings are to be used in an advertising campaign or as
part of a sales pitch, the results could be manipulated to show a bias in favour
of the desired outcome. Respondents could be chosen who are more likely to
give a favourable response. For example, a study comparing a domestic versus
foreign brand of car could be biased by choosing only people that own
domestic-made cars.
Another potential source of bias in the use of marketing research findings
is where the client explicitly or implicitly communicates to the researcher the
preferred research result. Most market researchers, however, accept the need
for objective studies where there is room for more than one interpretation of
the findings.
In the long term, it is in everyone’s interest to produce accurate findings,
as these are likely to be used for marketing planning decision-making. Using
misinformation can prove very risky.
Selling under the guise of marketing research
This practice, commonly known as ‘sugging’, is a real danger to the reputation
of marketing research, despite being the practice of unscrupulous firms that
use marketing research as a means of gaining compliance with their requests to
ask people questions, rather than of bona fide marketing research agencies.
Usually, questions begin innocently enough but quickly move on to the real
purpose of the exercise. Often this is to qualify leads and ask whether they
would be interested in buying the product or having a salesperson call.
‘Fruging’–fundraising under the guise of marketing research–is a similar
practice.
In Europe, ESOMAR encourages research agencies to adopt codes of
practice to prevent this sort of behaviour, and national bodies such as the
Market Research Society in the UK draw up strict guidelines. However, the
problem remains, and firms and organizations using sugging are unlikely to be
members of such bodies.
A fake or scam survey may drop into your mailbox, appear on your phone
or pop up when you visit a website. Fraudsters often create competitions or
sweepstakes, offering prizes or a coupon in return for your personal data. Theresult of completing an online survey that is a scam can result in many
negative outcomes, such as loss of money, identify theft, compromised
accounts and loss of personal data (see Exhibit 6.4).

Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapterpage 241
 Detailed Review
1. Use of big data for marketing decision-making
Access to vast sources of data generated by interactions between individual, firms
and technology is fundamentally reshaping marketing decision-making. Marketers
use big data to inform decision-making, set organization goals, and measure and
monitor performance.
2. Marketing analytics, goal-setting and performance measurement
Marketing analytics are tools, technologies and systems that are used to reveal
insights; they play a significant role in measuring performance and demonstrating
how marketing activities translate into revenue.
Previously, marketing information systems were a means of gathering, storing,
analysing and distributing information across organizations. Use of such systems
is now widespread and more sophisticated than in the past.
Planning analytics and performance measurement requires marketers to consider
four key questions:What do we want to achieve?
What is happening?
Why (is it happening)?
What actions should we take to ensure correction (if required) and control?
3. Different types of data sources
Data are the most basic form of knowledge, and become meaningful when
translated into information.
Information is a combination of data that provides decision-relevant knowledge.
Data can be found in different forms within a firm and beyond: internal and
continuous data; internal ad hoc data; data generated from environmental
scanning; market research data.
4. Customer insights and data-driven marketing
Digital marketing techniques and big data analytics are enabling precision
marketing.
Data-driven marketing facilitates the tailoring of products and services to better
meet the needs of the end customer.
Mapping the customer journey, and identifying media and channel touch points
aids precision marketing.
5. Scope of market and marketing research
Market research and marketing research are two terms used interchangeably. The
former leans towards looking at trends in the marketing activities of consumers,
firms and society, which have implications for practical and commercial marketing
activities. Marketing research has a wider and more academic scope.
6. The distinguishing features of qualitative and quantitative research
Qualitative research usually precedes quantitative research.
Qualitative research can provide rich, in-depth insights into consumer behaviour,
whereas the purpose of quantitative research tends to be to provide information
that can be generalized across the study population.
7. Stages in the marketing research process
The stages in the marketing research process are research planning (research
brief and proposal), exploratory research (secondary research, qualitative
research, consultation with experts and observation), the main (quantitative) data￾collection stage (descriptive and experimental research, sampling, survey method,
questionnaire design), data analysis and interpretation, and report writing and
presentation.
8. The nature and role of exploratory research
Exploratory research involves the preliminary exploration of a research area prior
to the quantitative data-collection stage. Its major purpose is to avoid the sins of
omission and admission. By providing an understanding of the people who are to
be interviewed later, the quantitative survey is more likely to collect valid and
reliable information.page 242
Exploratory research comprises secondary research, qualitative research,
consultation with experts and observation.
9. How to prepare a research brief and proposal
A research brief should explain the marketing problem and outline the
research objectives. Other useful information is background information, possible
sources of information, the proposed scale of the project and a timetable.
A research proposal should provide a statement of objectives, what will be done
(research design), a timetable and costs.
10. Quantitative research design decisions: sampling, survey method and
questionnaire design issues
Sampling decisions cover who and how many people to interview. The stages are
population definition, sampling frame search, sampling method specification,
sample size determination and sample selection.
Survey method decisions relate to how to interview people. The options are face￾to-face, by telephone or mail, and over the internet.
Questionnaire design decisions cover what questions to ask. Questionnaires
should be planned, designed and piloted before being administered to the main
sample.
11. Analysis and interpretation of data
Qualitative and quantitative analysis can be facilitated by using specialist software
packages.
Care should be taken when interpreting marketing research results. One common
failing is inferring cause and effect when only association has been established.
12. Report writing and presentation
The contents of a marketing research report should be title page, list of contents,
preface, summary, previous related research, research method, research findings,
conclusions and appendices.
Software packages such as PowerPoint can be used to make professional
presentations.
Research means: focus groups or depth interviews versus structured
questionnaires.
Operation: high flexibility in data collection versus low flexibility in data collection.
Data capture: audio recording requiring post-coding versus pre-coded response
categories on a structured questionnaire.
Sampling: small samples versus large samples.
Analysis: content analysis of respondent statements from audio recording versus
statistical analysis of pre-coded responses from a structured questionnaire.
Reporting: underlying themes illustrated by quotes from respondents and
summary statements versus statistical.
13. Ethical issues in marketing research analytics and customer insights
These are potential problems relating to data privacy, personalization, the dark
side of data analytics, misuse of marketing research findings and selling under the
guise of marketing research.page 243

ACCELERATING MARKET
RESEARCH: HARLEY￾DAVIDSON TURNS TO
ALBERT
Introduction
Harley-Davidson Motor Company was founded in 1903 by William Harley and Arthur Davidson,
with its headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The company quickly expanded to become a
global success in the heavyweight motorcycles segment. Distinct and innovative design helped
the company make Harley motorcycles popular across the world. Today it has manufacturing
facilities in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Missouri, and subsidiaries in Germany, the UK,
Benelux, France and Japan. Harley-Davidson has been singled out as one of the strongest
brand names, in an exclusive circle of cult brands that includes Apple and Mini. In 2022, the
company brand was valued at US$4.62 billion (Macrotrends 2022).
Although the last decade has been turbulent, a key driver of the company’s success is its use of
data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to refocus its marketing strategy.
Challenges for Harley-Davidson
Dwindling market share: despite a promising start, the road to success wasn’t always
straight for Harley as it faced significant challenges in the global market. US motorcycle
sales peaked at over 1.1 million in 2005, then plummeted during the global recession,
leaving Harley-Davidson facing extinction. The brand value dropped 43 per cent in 2009,
with a 66 per cent drop in company profits in 2008 (Penhollow 2014). In 2010, Harley￾Davidson shed hundreds of jobs in the US and saw a decline in shipments worldwide
(Forbes 2017).
Loss of market positioning: while Harley bikes were hugely popular with the baby boomer
generation, this segment was now ageing and Harley was struggling to replenish its corepage 247
customer base. The brand had also become associated with biker gangs, notably Hells
Angels, and was perceived as old-fashioned and outdated. Younger generations were
reluctant to embrace the brand, as ‘millennials’ were typically more price-conscious, risk
averse and tended to hold off on making discretionary expenditures (Hanbury 2017). In
addition, the millennial generation had strong opinions regarding the environmental impact
of the automotive industry, which posed a significant challenge for the fuel-guzzler Harley
product line. Younger riders typically choose two-wheeled vehicles for their convenience
and low environmental impact, rather than for recreation or brand owner prestige (Pafitis
2020). Finally, Harley-Davidson was characterized as having a more ‘male’ identity, with the
brand selling to a predominantly male, white middle-class market (Khulbe 2016).
Intense competition: in Europe, despite having a typical market share of 6–12 per cent in
the past few years, Harley continued to trail behind its main competitors (BMW, Triumph,
Yamaha, Suzuki, Honda and Kawasaki) (The Statistics Portal 2017). These competitors
focus their efforts on producing quality motorcycles that are affordable, to attract a wider
customer base. Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha and Kawasaki are sportier bikes with relatively
lower prices compared with Harleys (Khulbe 2016).

So, the challenges for Harley-Davidson were many, not least to fend off competition and grow
its share of a slowing market. The company was forced to take a hard look at every facet of its
marketing strategy. A radical plan for recovery and growth was introduced. Central to this plan
was Harley’s AI-driven market analytics and intelligence. Harley needed to gain insights into the
factors responsible for attracting consumers to buy motorcycles, as well as influences on
consumer satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The company wanted to know about the attitudes of
young adults (aged 18 to 34), especially women. It aimed to discover the features consumers
find most useful when buying a motorcycle and whether these features vary depending on their
age, gender and global location. The company needed to learn how the Harley-Davidson brand
was positioned in the minds of its customers compared with its competitors.
AI-driven Market IntelligenceHarley-Davidson knew that, to increase its market share, it had to reach as many people as
possible. In 2016, it deployed an AI system, ‘Albert’, that could discover trending behaviour at a
pace only a machine can handle. Albert has several distinct beneficial features. First, Albert can
identify and automatically target new audiences based on online social behaviours. Using
existing customer data, Albert can detect the characteristics of existing customers and build an
online profile for ‘lookalike customers’ who have similar demographic and behavioural profiles.
After the AI system identifies the lookalikes and their behavioural patterns, it learns what these
individuals do and don’t respond to, enabling the company to tailor interactions. Albert also
identifies customers who spend one to two minutes on the Harley website, and begins targeting
them and customizing responses, knowing that they’re engaged prospects. It can also
disregard visitors who leave the site within 15 seconds because that indicates a lack of interest
in the product.
In addition, Albert provides feedback about when and where Harley should display content on
its website or banner ads and how that content is performing (de Jesus 2019). For example,
Albert identified that, by changing wording used in advertising content, sales leads would
increase–telling potential customers to ‘call now’ rather than ‘buy now’ created a substantial
sales increase. This was achieved by running test campaigns and analysing the outcomes. In
addition to analysing the performance of word combinations, Albert identified the most
compelling colour combinations to be used for particular market segments. This allows Harley
to identify the highest-impact combinations of creative design and marketing messages. It also
enables it to automatically identify high-performance advertisements and discontinue poor
performers. Critically, Albert enables Harley to dynamically update its pricing and budget
allocation across all digital channels, enabling ‘on the fly’ marketing mix modelling (Albert.ai
2017).
Harley leverages its virtual community ‘HOG’ (Harley Owners Group) to gather substantial data
to feed its AI system. Although HOG was born in 1983 as a way for the brand’s highly
passionate consumers to connect as a group, Harley harnesses the power of Web 2.0
technology to expand the global reach of the community. The virtual community provides the
firm with access to invaluable information about members’ behaviours and lifestyles. It also
provides opportunities for Harley-Davidson to tailor offerings to the specific needs of its
customers.
The Results
To date, Harley’s AI-assisted marketing research has uncovered several critical results.
Findings showed that under-35s, particularly in Europe, liked less-chromed, lighter, faster and
smaller bikes. As a result, the company added a product line ‘Dark Custom’, including the
1200CX Roadster (Masurekar 2016). Company officials said that the new model’s design was
optimal for more challenging European driving conditions.
Findings of the work with Albert revealed that, in order to appeal to the female market, the
brand had to diversify its offerings. Although the brand was already positioned as a ‘lifestyle
brand’, research showed that Harley must emphasize its brand extensions such as clothing,
accessories and perfumes (for example, L’Oréal licensed the name Harley-Davidson for a line
of perfumes and colognes). The company also added Harley-Davidson branded gear and
apparel to its product line specifically designed for women (Thompson 2017).
Additionally, research showed a requirement from the HOG community for the provision of
specialized services and products. These include official Harley-Davidson insurance, financial
services, Harley-Davidson apparel, touring guides and member recognition rewards (de Jesus
2019).page 248
Albert also revealed a market desire for cleaner, more efficient vehicles that emulate the sound
and feel of riding a Harley. As a result, the company launched its first electric motorcycle, the
Harley-Davidson LiveWire, in 2020. LiveWire is said to be suitable for customers looking for a
fresh riding experience since it offers ‘rapid acceleration paired with sophisticated technology’
(Pafitis 2020). Listening to millennial demands, Harley’s latest technology foray
sees the launch of the second-generation Harley Serial 1 E-Bike range, which is
fully integrated with Google Cloud and provides enhanced safety, security, innovations and
route planning (Miot 2022).
Recent findings show that the pandemic triggered consumers to reassess their values, lifestyles
and goals. Many consumers are eager to break out of their confines and explore and embrace
novel experiences in the virtual and ‘real’ physical world (Mintel 2022). In addition, rising fuel
prices support a higher demand for motorcycles. This prompted Harley to refocus its marketing
around its core target group: patriotic, thrill-seeking, adventurous individuals with the drive to
experience the most out of life. In 2022, Harley informed its dealers of a new strategic
approach: fewer models appealing to bikers of premium-priced brands who are ‘Lookin’ for
adventure’ (Nigam 2022).
The company credits 40 per cent of motorcycle sales to Albert. Based on the success of this AI
deployment, multiple Harley outlets are rolling out AI solutions to drive business (Kaput 2021).
Continuing the Journey
In the future, Harley will continue to listen to the market and embrace change through the
implementation of new techniques to capture consumer data. In another AI-driven insightful
move, during the summer of 2018, the company ran its first 12-week #FindYourFreedom
internship, which allowed students to ride Harleys across the US, and get paid to explore and
discover ‘motorcycle culture’ (O’Donnell 2018). Trainees learned how to ride a motorcycle and,
in collaboration with Harley-Davidson’s marketing team, helped create content for the
company’s social media accounts.
Additionally, Harley recently launched a mobile app targeting the millennial market so as to
empower this group to share their experience online. This also enabled the firm to harness
customer innovation and insights. These highly engaged customers, in terms of their levels of
participation and commitment, are an important source of new product ideas for the brand.
Finally, as part of its post-Covid strategy, following extensive market research, Harley’s board
pushed to refocus on the traditional customer base, to retain the traditional models and to
reduce the number of models available in showrooms, in order to promote exclusivity. The
company also encouraged used bike sales in its showrooms, which was a first for Harley. In
addition, acknowledging the need to show sustainability for today’s customers, the company
launched the LiveWire Experience. This involved the rebranding of the ‘Harley Davidson
LiveWire’ to ‘LiveWire One’ in a bid to offer a thrilling riding experience in a variety of
environments, both urban and beyond (Hyatt 2022). As part of this new product line, the all-new
Del Mar was introduced, a midweight lower-cost electric vehicle (EV) that uses the new in￾house-designed Arrow EV architecture, which is considered a more scalable technology,
featuring an energy-dense battery that can be air or liquid cooled (Purvis 2022). The company
highlights that its long-term goal is to become a broader lifestyle brand, but its core message
will remain essentially the same: ‘Only Harley-Davidson delivers the fantasy of complete
freedom on the road and the comradeship of kindred spirits to avid cyclists.’page 249

CASE 12HUBSPOT: HARNESSING
THE POWER OF
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
FOR MARKETING
Introduction
HubSpot was founded in 2006, by two MIT graduate students, Brian Halligan and Dharmesh
Shah. The company began when its founders noticed how technology was reshaping shopping
behaviour for digitally savvy consumers. These consumers did not want to be disturbed by
marketers or harassed by salespeople; instead they wanted to be helped (HubSpot 2022). This
highlighted the importance of inbound marketing, a strategy that attracts customers by creating
valuable content and experiences tailored to their needs (Demodia 2022). Initially, HubSpot
acted as a resource for marketers, offering tools that helped small companies get started with
inbound marketing. To drive the business forward, HubSpot required a strong showcase for the
power of its platform as it evolved. Schwartz Communications was the example HubSpot
needed to prove its uniqueness. The company achieved substantial results after deploying
HubSpot in 2009, essentially growing its digital services income by 300 per cent in its first year
of use. This highlighted the importance of data and analytics to accelerate business
transformation and growth, recognizing that digital tools such as customer relationship
management (CRM) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help companies enhance the customer
experience and increase customer engagement.

Today, HubSpot has expanded to become a global success, offering cloud-based marketing
and sales software platforms that provide tools for CRM, social media marketing, content
management, lead generation, web analytics, search engine optimization (SEO), live chat andpage 251
customer support. By 2021, HubSpot had surpassed 100,000 paying customers and reached
$1 billion in annual recurring revenue, with a market cap of $14.3 billion (HubSpot 2021).
This case study discusses how HubSpot grew to be a powerhouse of inbound marketing
through the development, acquisition and deployment of AI, machine learning (ML) and chatbot
technologies.
AI-powered Market Research
In 2017, HubSpot announced that it had acquired Kemvi, an AI and ML start-up that helps
marketing teams deepen their relationships with their customers or prospective buyers. At a
fundamental level, AI is technology that can be used to enable machines to simulate human
intelligence. ML enables machines to learn from data, past behaviour or experiences without
being explicitly programmed to do so (JavaTPoint 2022). Essentially, ML provides data that
feeds into decisions made by AI systems. From a HubSpot perspective, these technologies
have a myriad of marketing uses. The technologies, for example, enable the automation of
tasks such as identifying new sales prospects or market segments, enhancing the consumer
experience by analysing hundreds of data points about a single user (including location,
demographics, device, interaction with the website, etc.), and producing personalized content,
giving marketers extra time to focus on more critical tasks. Kemvi also produces detailed
‘knowledge graphs’ that give a nuanced view of a customer’s behaviour and preferences
(Flanagan 2017a).
In 2020, HubSpot invested in Avoma, an AI meeting assistant that automatically transcribes,
summarizes and analyses meetings (Roetzer 2021). Avoma listens in on meetings and uses
learning algorithms to detect and document critical points and follow actions that
may emerge. Avoma’s analytics toolset enables marketers to discover common
themes or trends across multiple conversations (Lindsay 2020). Data analytics also enables
companies to identify direct correlations between key performance indicators (KPIs). For
example, analytics can provide meaningful insights such as customer acquisition cost (CAC) vs
lifetime value of a customer (LVAC), or sales qualified leads (SQL) vs referral traffic (RT)
(Riserbato 2020).
HubSpot leverages AI to automatically detect and capture critical data at every point in the
consumer journey, providing companies with a deeper understanding of their customers’ pain
points, expectations and satisfaction levels. This information helps companies to analyse
prospective sales leads, make SEO recommendations or content suggestions in response to
shifting social media trends, and monitor the performance of content across all digital channels.
AI-enabled Conversations
In 2017, HubSpot acquired a company called Motion AI (Leonard 2018). Motion AI’s product
enables the creation of highly trainable and customizable chatbots that can service almost any
interaction-related scenario, from booking meetings to providing customer support, making
initial sales calls and qualifying sales leads (Flanagan 2017b). A chatbot is an artificial
intelligence program made to simulate natural dialogue with human users, also known as
conversational AI. According to HubSpot’s data, many customers don’t mind whether they are
conversing with a real person or a robot so long as their specific needs are addressed.
Customers are more likely to buy from a company or website that offers live chat; when
HubSpot deployed chatbots to service its own customers and potential clients, they found that
this technology created an 80 per cent increase in its sales team efficiency (Echt-Wilson 2019).The Future
Empowered by advanced technologies, this world-class organization is poised to grow further.
In the future, HubSpot will continue to listen to the market and embrace change through the
implementation of new techniques to capture consumer data. HubSpot stated in 2020 that it will
be creating a content management system (CMS) that will be fully integrated with all of
HubSpot’s features and functions (Nicastro 2020). Digital material for the web, such as mobile
apps and social media, is created using a CMS. A CRM-powered content management system
is an intriguing view into the future of digital marketing as it integrates technology that can
select the most relevant content to display on a per-user basis or one with deep search engine
optimization capabilities.

HubSpot is also releasing tools like ‘custom behavioural events’ that let companies monitor
their customers’ online activities and use that data to develop dynamic profiles that can be used
to serve material that is tailored specifically to their needs (Hawthorne 2022). Additionally, ML
applied to aid AI technologies in predicting future behaviours based on past, learned, and
inferred events and information will be a significant technical advancement for HubSpot.
Questions
1. What do you think are other areas of marketing that might benefit from the technologies
discussed in this case?
2. How do you think AI technology will reinvent the stages in the marketing research process?
3. Research the term ‘ethical AI’ and discuss its implications for systems such as those
deployed by HubSpot.

ew products or services satisfy all customers. Even Google with its two
billion users, has only approaching 50 per cent of all internet users across
the globe (Internet World Stats 2018). Nevertheless, what makes Google so
widely used is its utility: its search facility will help you find what you are
looking for (arguably) and this is a free service (so long as you don’t mind
being digitally tracked). Google uses what it knows about us to serve up
organic results to our questions and sponsored advertising links, which aregenerated based on search behaviour and location. If you sign in to your
Google account and look at ad settings, you can see the profile Google has
built based on your search history and your profile: age, gender, interests,
shopping behaviour, location (Burgess 2018).
This type of knowledge is important–it forms the basis for market
segmentation, targeting and positioning, and aids the implementation of the
marketing concept by satisfying customer needs, as product and service
offerings can be tailored to meet the diverse requirements of different customer
groups. Marketers use personal profile information to get to grips with the
diverse nature of markets and this technique is called market segmentation.
Market segmentation may be defined as ‘the identification of individuals or
organizations with similar characteristics that have significant implications for
the determination of marketing strategy’. Market segmentation involves
dividing a diverse market into several smaller, more similar, submarkets. The
objective is to identify groups of customers with similar requirements so that
they can be served effectively while being of a sufficient size for the product or
service to be supplied efficiently. Usually, in consumer markets, it is not
possible to create a marketing mix that satisfies every individual’s
requirements exactly but, as the example of Google has shown online, high
levels of personalization are increasingly possible (see Chapters 6 and 15 for
further discussion of new trends and techniques for using digital analytics).
Grouping together customers with similar needs provides a commercially
viable method of serving customers in the chosen target market and gives
focus to how to position the market offer. This is at the heart of strategic
marketing and these three techniques are the subject of this chapter.
Why Bother to Segment Markets?
Why go to the trouble of segmenting markets? What are the gains to be made?
Figure 7.1 identifies four benefits.
FIGURE 7.1
The benefits of market segmentationTarget market selection
Market segmentation provides the basis for the selection of target markets. A
target market is a chosen segment of market that a company has decided to
serve. As customers in the target market segment have similar characteristics, a
single marketing mix strategy can be developed to match those requirements.
Creative approaches towards segmentation may result in the identification of
new segments that have not been served adequately and may form attractive
target markets. For example, Google regularly introduces new product offers to
serve the functional needs of different target markets, such as Google Pay for
shoppers who want to buy Google Nest Cam, a home security system with
sophisticated AI that can recognize human and animal faces; Google TV,
which is aiming to give viewers the option to bring all their online streaming
entertainment to one device; and Google Maps for smartphone users (Nagar
2022).
Tailored marketing mix
Market segmentation allows the grouping of customers based upon similarities
(e.g. benefits sought) that are important when designing marketing strategies.
Consequently, this allows marketers to understand in-depth the requirements of
a segment and tailor a marketing mix package that meets its needs. This is a
fundamental step in the implementation of the marketing concept;
segmentation promotes the notion of customer satisfaction by viewing markets
as diverse sets of needs marketers must understand and meet.page 255
For example, BMW has introduced the BMWi3, a high-performance but
low-emission saloon car, to serve a target market that wants a more sustainable
mode of transport than a conventional carbon-fuel car. BMW uses
segmentation to focus its product portfolio on the ‘right’ customers:
psychographic segmentation focusing on lifestyle variables helps the firm
target customers for the BMW i3; income, age and lifestyle for the BMW 6
Series range; geographic, age and behavioural variables for the Mini ranges
(see Exhibit 7.1).

Differentiation
Market segmentation allows the development of differential marketing
strategies. By breaking a market into its constituent subsegments, a firm may
differentiate its offerings between segments (if it chooses to target multiple
segments) and, within each segment, it can differentiate its offering from that
of the competition. By creating a differential advantage over the competition, a
firm is giving the customer a reason to buy from it rather than the competition.
For example, Apple created the smartphone market with the launch of its first
iPhone in 2007. Bundling a new set of applications and functionality into its
mobile handset gave the iPhone the difference needed to attract a new
generation of mobile users. Apple has led the way, but competition in thismarket is intense. Nearest rival Samsung sells smartphones technically similar,
as does Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi. These firms compete on design, price
and technical features to differentiate their offer. Read Marketing in Action 7.1
to find out how Fyndiq is differentiating its business from internet giants
Amazon and eBay.
MARKETING IN ACTION 7.1
Start-up Business Fyndiq Creates a Marketplace With
a Difference
Fyndiq is a Swedish start-up business launched in 2010, which has created an e-commerce
platform for online retailers and shoppers specifically targeting 18 to 27 year olds. The
marketplace is differentiated from its competitors by focusing on bargain products. It targets
bargain hunters and positions the business online as ‘The Bargain Superstore’. The items
on sale are end-of-lines and slow-selling products that are heavily discounted. Sellers are
currently allowed to list their products free of charge and then pay a fee of just 5 per cent
once the items are sold. Currently, there are more than 1,700 merchants selling to 2 million
unique visitors to the online platform each month and the company is expanding to serve
markets across Europe. CEO Dinesh Nayar and co-founder Fredrik Norberg aim for Fyndiq
to become ‘Amazon for bargain products’. Says Norberg, ‘We continue to own the bargain
position’ (2020).

Opportunities and threats
Market segmentation is useful when attempting to spot opportunities and
threats. Markets are rarely static. As customers become more affluent, seek
new experiences and develop new values, new segments emerge. The company
that first spots a new and underserved market segment, and meets its needs
better than the competition, can benefit from increasing sales and profit
growth. Zara is a fashion brand built on a market opportunity: to
supply fashionable clothing to the market quickly. Zara pioneered the
concept of fast fashion, which means that new designs are available in weeks
rather than the fashion industry standard of six months. Spotting this
opportunity has enabled Zara to develop into one of the world’s largest fashion
brands.
Similarly, the neglect of a market segment can pose a threat if competition
uses it as a gateway to market entry. US fashion brand Gap opened in the UK
in 1987. The rival to Zara failed to spot the changing trends among fashion￾conscious shoppers, so as Gap’s core target market aged, the brand failed to
attract younger fashion-hungry consumers and lost its market lead to Zara. Gap
was slow to develop its online offer in Europe and lack of investment meant it
lagged behind competing online fashion retailers like ASOS. Eventually Gap
closed all its high-street stores in the UK (Timmins 2021).
Market segments need to be protected from competitors if firms are to
avoid threats from new entrants gaining a foothold and growing market share
in poorly served areas where they are not meeting the needs of the market
segment.
The Process of Market Segmentation
and Target Marketing
The selection of a target market or markets is a three-step process (see Figure
7.2):
1. Understand the requirements and characteristics of the individuals and/or
organizations that comprise the market. Marketing research can be used
here.2. Divide the market, according to these requirements and characteristics, into
segments that have implications for developing marketing strategies. Note: a
market can be segmented in various ways depending on the choice of
criteria. For example, the market for cars could be segmented by type of
buyer (individual or organizational), major benefit sought in a car (e.g.
functionality or status) and family size (empty-nester vs family with
children). There are no rules about how a market should be segmented.
Using a new criterion or using a combination of well-known criteria in a
novel way may give fresh insights into a market. For example, TomTom
changed the way drivers navigate with the launch of its satellite navigation
device TomTom Go and the firm constantly innovates its products; the Go
Discover, for example, includes live traffic, speed cameras, fuel pricing and
off-street parking, to give drivers the ultimate package in driving
information.
3. Choose market segment(s) to target. A marketing mix can then be
developed, based on a deep understanding of target market customers’ needs
and values. The aim is to design a mix that is distinctive from competitors’
offerings. This theme of creating a differential advantage will be discussed
in more detail later in this chapter when we examine how to position a
product in the marketplace.
FIGURE 7.2
The process of market segmentation and target marketingpage 257
Segmenting Consumer Markets
Markets can be segmented in many ways. Segmentation variables are the
criteria that are used for dividing a market into segments.
When examining criteria, the marketer is trying to identify good predictors
of differences in buyer behaviour. There is an array of options and no single
prescribed way of segmenting a market (Wind 1978). Now we look at possible
ways of segmenting consumer markets.
There are three broad groups of consumer segmentation criteria:
behavioural, psychographic and profile variables. Since the purpose of
segmentation is to identify differences in behaviour that have implications for
marketing decisions, behavioural variables such as buying patterns and
benefits sought from the product may be considered the basis for
segmentation. PizzaExpress has developed a loyalty scheme based on
customer behaviour to give the brand a refresh and new market position. Pizza
eaters are passionate about the brand, so its PizzaExpress Club loyalty scheme
rewards members every time they eat at one of its restaurants, while Pizza
Stamps are awarded to customers using delivery and collection services and
scanning codes on supermarket-bought PizzaExpress products (Houston 2022)
(see Exhibit 7.2).
EXHIBIT 7.2

Psychographic variables are used when researchers believe purchasing
behaviour is correlated with the personality or lifestyle of consumers;
consumers with different personalities or lifestyles have varying product or
service preferences, and may respond differently to marketing mix offerings.
Having found these differences, the marketer needs to describe and identify the
individuals; this can be done using profile variables such as socio-economic
group or geographic location. For example, a marketer may see whether there
are groups of people who value low calories in soft drinks, and attempt to
profile them in terms of their age, socio-economic groupings and so on.
In practice, segmentation may not follow this logical sequence. Often,
profile variables will be identified first and then the segments so described will
be examined to see if they show different behavioural responses. Age or
income groups are frequently used as a basis for identifying market segments,
and marketing managers examine groups of individuals to see if they show
different attitudes and requirements towards particular products and initiatives.
Figure 7.3 shows the major segmentation variables used in consumer markets
and Table 7.1 describes each of these variables in greater detail.

Behavioural segmentation
In behavioural segmentation, the key behavioural bases for segmenting
consumer markets are benefits sought, purchase occasion, purchase behaviour,
usage, and perceptions, attitudes, beliefs and values. Each will now be
discussed.
Benefits sought
This segmentation criterion can be applied when the people in a market seek
different benefits from a product. For example, the fruit drink market could bepage 259
segmented by benefits sought. Table 7.2 shows such a breakdown, with
examples of the brands targeting each segment.

Low calorie, less sugar Half Naked fruit smoothie, PLJ lemon juice cordial,
Tropicana lean
Convenience Capri-Sun orange sachets, Innocent Kids, Fruit Shoot
Benefit segmentation provides an understanding of why people buy, and
aids the identification of market opportunities. For example, the LEGO Group
used to focus on making toys for boys, with its packs of building bricks
designed to assemble helicopters, trains and rockets, and ‘warrior-themed’
product ranges. However, after four years of research into how girls play, the
firm introduced a range called LEGO Friends, aimed at 6- to 12-year-old girls.
Now, both boys and girls playing with LEGO bricks can enjoy the product’s
educational benefits, for example developing spatial awareness, and
mathematical and fine motor skills through play (Wieners 2011; Wachman
2012).
Many markets are segmented on price sensitivity. Often a market is
characterized by a segment of customers who value the benefit of low price,
and another that values high quality or service and is prepared to pay more for
a particular benefit. In the UK grocery market, supermarket brands use price to
develop ranges for different market segments. Tesco develops product ranges
targeting different price points–Everyday Value, Exclusively at Tesco, Tesco
Finest–but remains focused on delivering value. By monitoring the cost of the
weekly shop, changes in inflation and the cost of living, and providingcompetitive advantage through the Tesco Clubcard, the supermarket chain
aims to keep ahead of all its competitors, including limited-range discounters
like Aldi and Lidl. With the Aldi Price Match initiative Tesco sought to
position the supermarket in its customers minds as offering great value at low
prices (Jefferson 2022).
Benefit segmentation is a fundamental method of segmentation, because
the objective of marketing is to provide customers with benefits they value.
Knowing the various benefits people value is therefore a basic prerequisite of
understanding markets. Benefit segmentation provides the framework for
classifying individuals based upon this knowledge. Profile analyses can then
be performed to identify the type of people (e.g. by age, gender, socio￾economic grouping) in each benefit segment so that targeting can take place.

HIDDEN GEM 7.1
Alpro Gives You Plant Power
Background
Alpro is the pioneer of plant-based products. The firm started making products using soya
and, since 1980, has found ways to produce alternatives to dairy products using plants.
From its base at Wevelgem in Belgium, the firm manufactured products made from 100 per
cent soya, before expanding to France under the name Sojinal, with a factory in Issenheim,
and then to the Kettering in the UK. By 2005, the brand had launched Alpro in Germany and
the Netherlands, where it set up its new corporate offices in Ghent, and then in 2009
became sister company to WhiteWave in the US, which was eventually bought out by
French FMCG food manufacturer Danone in 2017.page 260
Source: DenisMArt/Shutterstock
The Alpro Foundation
Established in 1996, the Alpro Foundation is an independent institute whose aims are to
promote research and development into plant-based nutrition, change government policy
behaviour, impact on food consumption to reduce the production of nitrogen, and promote
healthier diets and lifestyles. By understanding the impact of a plant-based diet on people’s
health and well-being, the Foundation constantly seeks ways to feed human populations
that are sustainable in the longer term. Scientists have discovered 29 per cent of calories in
western diets come from meat but livestock production methods are less efficient compared
to production of plant-based proteins. The land footprint needed to produce a meat-based
diet is, at its highest level, 5,161 square metres per person, whereas for a vegan diet the
area needed is 1,057 square metres. A shift from a meat-rich to a low-meat diet could
significantly reduce carbon emissions, and improve natural pollination and freshwater
supply.
Plant-based alternatives
The target market for plant-based alternatives has grown from a small niche of consumers
to a much wider customer base, including vegans (who avoid all animal products–foodstuffs
‘with feathers and leather’), vegetarians (who exclude meat, fish and eggs but eats dairy),
pescatarians (vegetarians who occasionally eat fish) and flexitarians (people who
occasionally eat meat, dairy and eggs). Alpro targets these segments, and has entered the
mainstream with drinks made from nuts and milk, cream desserts and yoghurts made from
plants. The market for plant-based alternatives has grown rapidly since 2018, and more
than a third of millennials have expressed a preference for these types of products. In 40
years Alpro has moved into the mainstream and its products are widely available on
supermarket shelves.
Barista for coffee loversAlpro keeps a keen focus on market trends and in response to the increased ownership of
home coffee machines, it realized there was a market for a plant-based alternative to milk
that could be ‘perfect for foaming or pouring straight from the carton’. To serve this, it
launched its Barista range of soya, oat and almond plant-based milks.
The future
Alpro has been doing good things for many years. The brand is in touch with the needs and
wants of its target segment, and its products have good environmental credentials.
However, ownership by Danone is controversial, as Groupe Danone holds a 24 per cent
share of the global fresh dairy product market and, despite claims that it is moving towards
sustainability, many of Alpro’s loyal customers see this as cause for complaint. Something
for the brand to address in future as it expands to more diverse target markets.

Purchase occasion
Customers can be distinguished according to when they purchase a product.
For example, a product (e.g. washing machine) or service (e.g. plumbing) may
be purchased as a result of an emergency or as a routine unpressurized buy.
Price sensitivity, for example, is likely to be much lower in an emergency
buying situation. Some products (e.g. mobile phones) may be bought as gifts
or as self-purchases. These different occasions can have implications for
marketing mix and targeting decisions. If it is found that the gift market is
concentrated at Christmas, advertising budgets will be concentrated in the pre￾Christmas period. Package design may differ for the gift versus personal-buy
segment also. Many brands of chocolate are targeted at the gift segment of the
confectionery market, for example Hotel Chocolat (UK), Bonnat (France) and
Ritter Sport (Germany) (see Exhibit 7.3). Often, special occasions such as
Easter and Christmas are associated with higher prices. However, prices fall
rapidly after the occasion, for example chocolate eggs are discounted after
Easter Sunday.

Purchase behaviour
Differences in purchase behaviour can be based on the time of purchase
relative to the launch of the product or on patterns of purchase. When a new
product is launched, a key task is to identify the innovator segment of the
market. These people (or organizations) may have distinct characteristics that
allow communication to be targeted specifically at them (e.g. young, middle
class). Innovators are more likely to be willing to buy the product soon after
launch. Other segments of the market may need more time to assess
the benefits, and delay purchase until after the innovators have taken
the early risks of purchase. Only when the credentials have been established
among these ‘innovators’ is the brand moved to a wider target audience. For
example, the number of electric cars is still relatively low and prices are
typically high, and as yet this type of car still has to appeal to a wide audience
as a foundation for future market growth (product and market diffusion are
discussed in detail in Chapter 9).
The degree of brand loyalty in a market may also be a useful basis for
segmenting customers. Solus buyers are totally brand loyal, buying only one
brand in the product group, such as a person who buys only Ariel laundry
liquids. However, most customers brand-switch: some buyers of Ariel laundry
products may also buy two or three other brands (e.g. Persil, Fairy), while
others might show no loyalty to any individual brand but switch brands on the
basis of special offers (e.g. money off) or because they are variety-seekers who
look to buy a different brand each time. By profiling the characteristics of each
group, a company can target each segment accordingly. By knowing the typeof person (e.g. by age, socio-economic group, media habits) who is brand
loyal, a company can channel persuasive communications to defend this
segment. By knowing the characteristics and shopping habits of offer-seekers,
sales promotions can be targeted correctly.
In the consumer durables market, brand loyalty can be used as a segment
variable to good purpose. For example, Volkswagen has divided its customers
into first-time buyers, replacement buyers (model-loyal replacers and
company-loyal replacers) and switch buyers. These segments are used to
measure performance and market trends, and for forecasting purposes (Hooley
et al. 2012).
A recent trend in consumer services sectors has been towards biographics.
This is the linking of actual purchase behaviour to individuals. The growth in
retailer loyalty schemes has provided a mechanism for gathering behavioural
data. Customers are given cards that are swiped through an electronic machine
at the checkout so that points can be accumulated towards discounts and
vouchers. The more loyal the shopper, the higher the number of points gained.
The retailer benefits by knowing the purchasing behaviour of named
individuals. Online behavioural targeting and browser fingerprinting are
discussed in Chapters 14 and 15.
Usage
Customers can also be segmented on the basis of heavy users, light users and
non-users of a product category. The profiling of heavy users allows this group
to receive most marketing attention (particularly promotion efforts) on the
assumption that creating brand loyalty among these people will pay heavy
dividends. Sometimes the 80:20 rule applies, where about 80 per cent of a
product’s sales come from 20 per cent of its customers.
However, information technology has increased access to and knowledge
of niche markets, and the ‘long tail’ is a term used to reflect the increase in
interest in niche products by marketers (Brynjolfsson et al. 2011). Brands are
increasingly developed to target niche market segments. For example, as
populations are ageing, there is more demand for specialist healthcare
products, and car manufacturers like Ford and BMW are adding healthcare
technology to their cars so they can access niche segments, for example
detecting Covid-19, electrocardiogram (ECG) seats that measure the heart rate
of the driver automatically, air purifying systems (Irwin 2022).page 262
Marketing managers need to be aware selecting heavy-user segments can
deliver benefits in terms of volume of potential sales, but analysing the light￾user segments can provide insights that can deliver advantages over the
competition. Target Group Index (TGI) Europa is a good source of information
on consumer product and brand usage, and media consumption motivations
belief and behaviours, and provides actionable marketing information across
market segments (Kantar Media 2022). An important point: while use may
prove helpful for identifying buyers of products, it may not necessarily give
insight into an individual’s ‘shopping basket’ of items. For example, luxury
foods and drinks may be purchased for a special event like a birthday, but
value groceries may be selected for everyday use.
The key issue to remember is market segmentation concerns the grouping
of individuals or organizations with similar characteristics that have
implications for the determination of marketing strategy.
Perceptions, attitudes, beliefs and values
The final behavioural base for segmenting consumer markets is by studying
perceptions, attitudes, beliefs and values. This is classified as a behaviour
variable because perceptions, attitudes, beliefs and values are often strongly
linked to behaviour. Consumers are grouped by identifying those individuals
who view the products in a market in a similar way (perceptual segmentation)
and have similar beliefs (belief segmentation). These kinds of segmentation
analyses provide an understanding of how groups of customers view the
marketplace. To the extent that the groups’ perceptions and beliefs
are different, opportunities to target specific groups more effectively
may arise.
Attitudes towards products and services can prove fruitful as a basis for
segmenting a market. Car manufacturers use belief segmentation to divide the
market and target specific groups, for example Toyota aimed to attract a new
generation of car buyers in Europe with its Yaris model. In targeting 20–30
year olds, Toyota used direct marketing to persuade this group that these cars
are fun, entertaining and enjoyable to own. New models have features deemed
attractive to the target market, such as Bluetooth phone and audio streaming,
adaptive cruise control, driver assist technologies, night-time pedestrian
detection, and the myT app to help with booking car services and planning
journeys (Toyota 2022).Behavioural segmentation online
Aligning customer needs with product and service offers through segmentation
enables marketers to create messages and design suitable products and services
for specific groups. Online behavioural targeting considers browsing histories,
search patterns and time frames to connect consumers and their interests.
Marketers can use such data to precisely profile potential target customers.
This type of targeting reveals deep insights into customer preferences and,
when linked to digital media usage, can lead to highly directed targeting of
marketing messages. Behavioural targeting works as it can increase the
relevance of communication messaging. Researchers (Yu et al. 2017) found
behavioural targeting to be effective in the marketing of luxury brands, in
shifting attitudes to become more positive, and increasing engagement with
websites and social media used by the brand. However, they found culture
played an important role in the effectiveness of this form of targeting, for
example in the Netherlands, where people tend to be highly individualistic, it
worked very well, but in China, where people share their personal information
less freely, behavioural targeting did not produce the same level of results.
Therefore, it is important to consider the cultural orientation of target markets.
Evolving segmentation variables, online and social
According to research (Doherty and Ellis-Chadwick 2010), online consumer
markets can be identified using demographic, behavioural and psychographic
variables in much the same way as offline markets. There are similarities with
categories of variables in the virtual world, for example personal profiles (age,
gender, education, income, and so on), which mean internet shoppers are like
their offline counterparts (Jayawardhena et al. 2007). Furthermore,
demographic variables that have significant implications for online targeting
are those found to remain static or evolve slowly over time throughout an
individual’s lifetime, such as age, race (Hoffman et al. 2003) and gender
(Slyke et al. 2002).
Psychographic and behavioural variables are those shaping perceptions,
beliefs and attitudes that influence consumers’ online behaviour, and their
intention to shop or engage with an online offer. Online behavioural
characteristics, such as knowledge, attitude, innovativeness and risk aversion,
have been found to have significant implications when segmenting online
markets and when considering a consumer’s likelihood to shop online. For
example, consumers who are primarily motivated by convenience are morepage 263
likely to make purchases online, while those who value physical social
interactions are less interested (Swaminathan et al. 1999; Kukar-Kinney et al.
2009). Moreover, a study of internet shoppers from six countries (developing
and developed) found a surprisingly high degree of homogeneity in the
characteristics and habits (Brashear et al. 2009) of internet shoppers, who
share a ‘desire for convenience, are more impulsive, have more favourable
attitudes towards direct marketing and advertising, are wealthier, and are
heavier users of both email and the internet’.
There are negative consequences of effective online targeting. For
example, online is a favourite channel for the compulsive shopper, as they can
‘buy unobserved’, ‘without contact with other shoppers’, and, in so doing,
‘experience strong positive feelings during the purchase episode’.
Consequently, online shopping can become an addiction (Manchiraju et al.
2017).
Social media are different to e-commerce platforms and websites, which
can be perceived as virtual destinations similar to physical stores, as it enables
the sharing of user-generated content (UGC) and peer-to-peer networking.
Nevertheless, social media comprise an important digital channel where
market messages are shared. Developing an understanding of consumer
motivations and behaviour, and how to access segments is vital. Social media
segmentation is perhaps best understood by looking at how consumers behave
when they interact with social networks, for example do people find social
media platforms easy and convenient to use, enjoy browsing, feel they offer a
good way to research a product or brand, or offer a way to learn
useful things? Campbell et al. (2014) looked at this type of
behaviour and found five segments of social media users:
1. Active–highest achievers on social media platforms, interacting with
marketing messages is seen as vital to product and service decision-making.
Highly motivated shoppers, tend to be younger and female.
2. Talkers–high level of brand engagement and purchase intention, responsive
to marketing messages and word of mouth; can be influenced by marketing
messages on social media but focus on informational messages.
3. Passives–unlikely to respond to social media marketing messages, mainly
male, send few referrals.
4. Hesitants–low levels of brand and social media engagement, rarely respond
to social media adverts, tend to be older males.5. Averse–not impacted by social media marketing, more likely to be
individuals who shop in stores rather than online.
Behavioural segmentation offers much opportunity to identify potential
customers to target. The next section considers the way we live and how our
personalities might be used for segmenting markets.
Psychographic segmentation
Psychographic segmentation involves grouping people according to their
lifestyle and personality characteristics. To do this successfully requires an
understanding of the impact of lifestyle segmentation on purchase intention in
relation to perception of the value of a brand (Akkaya 2021).
Lifestyle
This form of segmentation attempts to group people according to their way of
living as reflected in their activities, interests and opinions. The Values and
Lifestyles framework (VALS) makes use of the principles and values people
use, to judge what is important in their lives. VALS is a global segmentation
system that can provide consumer insights with implications for marketing
strategy and planning (SBI 2018). It was developed by SBI International as an
innovative market research tool to determine the motivations that underpin
consumer purchasing decision-making (SBI International 2021). However,
recent research has questioned the effect of lifestyle on brand purchase
intentions (Akkaya 2021). The study considered different product categories–
smartphones, sports shoes, tissues and chocolate bars–and found lifestyle had a
limited direct effect, although it did have an indirect effect on brand purchase
intentions. This supports a long-standing question with regard to lifestyle
segmentation, which is the extent to which general lifestyle patterns are
predictive of purchasing behaviour in specific markets. This study reinforced
that marketing practitioners should use lifestyle segmentation alongside other
dimensions of consumer behaviour, and be aware that perceived value shaped
by lifestyle is a more important measure than lifestyle alone (Akkaya 2021).
Despite this research, lifestyle segmentation has proved popular among
advertising agencies, which have attempted to relate brands (e.g. Hugo Boss)
to a particular lifestyle (e.g. aspirational). In television, Sky has used lifestyle
segmentation to target special interest groups, including sports enthusiasts
(Sky Sports), film lovers (Sky Movies) and news followers (Sky News).page 264
Personality
The idea that brand choice may be related to personality is intuitively
appealing. However, the usefulness of personality as a segmentation variable is
likely to depend on the product category. Buyer and brand personalities are
likely to match where brand choice is a direct manifestation of personal values,
but for most fast-moving consumer goods (e.g. detergents, tea, cereals) the
reality is that people buy a repertoire of brands (Lannon 1991). Personality
(and lifestyle) segmentation is more likely to work when brand choice is a
reflection of self-expression; the brand becomes a badge that makes public an
aspect of personality: ‘I choose this brand to say this about me and this is how
I would like you to see me.’ For example, Mercedes’ brand personality is all
about the brand’s assertiveness, and is reflected in its strapline, ‘the best or
nothing’, whereas BMW uses the phrase ‘the ultimate driving machine’ to
reflect the desirable aspects of its more sensuous personality (Millward Brown
2015). Tesla, currently the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer,
has not used advertising to achieve its market-leading position, but its vehicles
are recognized for having the characteristics of excitement and sophistication,
and its buyers are very brand loyal.
Profile segmentation
Profile segmentation variables allow consumer groups to be classified in such
a way that they can be reached by communications media (e.g. advertising,
internet communications). Even if behaviour and/or psychographic
segmentation have successfully distinguished between buyer preferences, there
is often a need to analyse the resulting segments in terms of profile
variables such as age and socio-economic group to communicate to
them. The reason is that readership and viewership profiles of newspapers,
magazines and television programmes tend to be expressed in that way.
We shall now examine demographic, socio-economic and geographic
segmentation variables.
Demographic variables
The demographic variables we shall look at are age, gender and lifecycle.
Age has been used to segment consumer markets for many years (Tynan
and Drayton 1987). For example, children receive their own TV programmes;cereals, computer games and confectionery are other examples of markets
where products are formulated with children in mind. The sweeter tooth of
children is reflected in sugared cereal brands targeted at children (e.g.
Kellogg’s Rice Krispies and Coco Pops). It should be noted that recent
pressure to reduce sugar consumption has led to manufacturers lowering the
amount of sugar in their brands. L’Oréal targets the over-50s with its Age
Perfect and Revitalift brands, while Vodafone targets 35–55 year olds with an
easy-to-use, no-frills mobile phone that offers the uncomplicated functionality
that many in this segment group value (Simms 2005). See Exhibit 7.4 for how
Fanny Karst views fashion and age.
EXHIBIT 7.4

Age is widely used for segmenting products as well as services. The
holiday market is often segmented by age, gender, family size and income,
with offerings targeted at different groups depending on travel motivations and
needs. Age is important as it generally has an influence on whether a
holidaymaker is looking for relaxation, adventure or nature exploration.
Marital status is another factor affecting travel decisions. Couples tend to have
family obligations and to choose vacations that will please many in the group.page 265
Families travelling with teenage children will tend to take longer breaks and
look for sporting and other activities at their chosen destinations, whereas
single traveller’s prefer shorter and more frequent journeys such as city breaks
and exotic leisure destinations (Kara and Mkwizu 2020).
Despite the latest challenges raised by using age as a segmentation
variable, many companies covet the youth segment, which comprises the
major purchasers of items such as clothing, consumer electronics, drinks,
personal care products and magazines. One popular way to communicate with
these segments is through digital media communications. Marketing in Action
7.2 explores some of the issues related to understanding these key market
segments.
MARKETING IN ACTION 7.2
The A–Z of Digital Generations
During the last two decades, a generation of digitally informed new consumers has been
born to shop online. But they are not the only generation that has learned how to function in
the technology-enhanced world: others, too, are learning how to become digital natives.
Marketers need to understand and be able to identify these consumers, to engage with the
generations. Here are just a few of the digitally able generations:
A is for Generation Alpha: millennials’ children born since 2010, this generation have
grown up in an increasingly technology-enabled world. Their lives are dominated by
smartphones, tablets and digital devices, which fulfil the needs of every aspect of their lives.
They tend to have accessed and experienced every aspect of the digital world at first hand.
By 2030, they will have become primary household decision-makers.
B is for baby boomers: those born between 1946 and 1964, who have no intention of
opting for a quiet life. People in this group tend to be both mentally and physically active,
and as a segment are likely to drive future growth in retail spending; they are high online
spenders but spend a smaller percentage of their income online than do millennials. They
are tech-savvy consumers and have taken to mobile commerce, with 85 per cent likely to
research a product online before making a purchase.
C is for content: Generation C are the group of customers who, rather than being
consumers of content, are in fact the creators of content, or prosumers as they have been
called. Highly sophisticated digital devices enable consumers to produce content such as
images, videos and audio tracks. These are individuals of all ages and backgrounds, so age
is not a useful segmentation variable in this case. For marketers, the commercial advantage
of consumer-generated content is that it reveals hidden preferences. For example, the risepage 266
in popularity of ‘unboxing’, where a person films the unwrapping and initial operation of a
new purchase (invariably a newly released piece of technology), and films that demonstrate
things about a particular product the buyer finds difficult or that they enjoy. Increasingly,
marketers are engaging consumers in the product development process, working together
to produce finely tuned market offerings.
D is for digital natives: a broad term coined in 2001 to capture the group of people who
were ‘born digital’. The term has come to mean those born after 1980, who have been
exposed to computer technology and digital communications since birth.
M is for millennials: a key target group of online consumers because they spend more
money online than any other group. Millennials were born between 1981 and 1996. Their
attitudes vary, seeing them labelled the ‘me, me, me generation’, but also the ‘nice
generation’. Arguably, those in this generation have grown up with more structure in their
lives, and family values are important to them. During their early years, there was a
downturn in violence against children and an increase in child-friendly gadgets to promote
their safe upbringing. Millennials are risk averse, aspire to stable careers and are less likely
to have a credit card than are Gen Xers (see below). Online reviews are important to this
generation and they are more likely to shop online than any other.
S is for silent generation: born between 1928 and 1945, this generation started out life in
turbulent economic times. The Great Depression and Second World War both had an
influence in making a generation that took no chances and kept quiet about things.
X is for Generation Xers: born between 1965 and 1980, this is a generation of extremes–
during childhood, they tended to experience indulgent parenting styles from their baby
boomer parents, but, as they got older, divorce, poor schooling and other social factors led
to this group being called the ‘baby bust generation’. The Gen Xers were hit hard by the
2008 recession, and tended to downsize and live a DIY lifestyle. This generation will use
digital media but like it to be easy to use and straightforward.
Y is for Generation Y: at the younger end of the millennials cohort, Gen Y have unique
product preferences and different attitudes to brands; multichannel shopping particularly
appeals to this group. Like millennials in general, they are accused of being selfish and love
spending time online.
Z is for Generation Z: this group spends the largest percentage of time online, 58 per cent
cannot go more than four hours without internet access. Born between 1997 and 2012, with
many still in their teens, they have grown up in a world of political and financial turmoil. They
care about the world they live in and see education as a thing to be treasured. They are
more likely to volunteer than are their Gen X parents and millennials. More likely to interact
with social media messaging than any other generation, they expect digital marketers to
know their likes, wants and interests.

Wallop (2014); Lavelle (2019); Jones (2022); Stokes (2022)
Gender also offers much for a marketing manager planning a segmentation
strategy. The different tastes and customs of men and women are reflected inspecialist products aimed at these market segments. Magazines, clothing,
hairdressing and cosmetics are product categories that have used segmentation
based on gender.
The classic family lifecycle stages offer opportunities to segment by a
range of related variables, such as disposable income, family responsibilities,
and consumption patterns based on family circumstances (e.g. single, married,
divorced, living with or without children). Lifecycle stages are discussed in
detail in Chapter 4.
Based upon population census data, ‘People UK’ is arranged in eight life
stages: starting out, young with toddlers, young families, singles/couples/no
kids, middle-aged families, empty-nesters, retired couples, and older singles.
Produced by CACI, the system is particularly useful for targeted mailing,
because it can be applied to everyone on the UK electoral roll (CACI 2022).
People are classified according to the neighbourhood in which they live
(Chisnall 2005). The methodology is described a little later in this section,
when we discuss CACI’s ACORN and Experian’s Mosaic geodemographic
systems. Now read Marketing in Action 7.3 on digital personas.
MARKETING IN ACTION 7.3
Digital Personas
Source: Hugethank/Shutterstock
According to Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick (2022), digital personas are created using fictional
profiles to represents an online target audience. Segmentation variables are used to build apage 267
profile and then other considerations can be included like buying motivations, buying
scenarios, preferred digital media channels, barriers and success factors. As the persona
develops, more facets are added and may include a customer journey map, which
anticipates where the fictional character might first become aware of a marketing offer,
where they will go to evaluate alternatives before making a buying decision, where the final
decision will take place and where advocacy might occur.
Leading digital marketer Dave Chaffey is a fan of personas but cautions the problem is
making sure they are accurate and represent a firm’s target markets (Chaffey, in Allen
2018). He suggests personas are useful for building a customer-centric view of a website
and gives the example of Dulux paint, which developed six different personas to identify
specific target markets. Thinking through who the customers were and how they would
interact with the firm’s online offer helped to drive sales.
Based on: Allen (2018); Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick (2022)
Socio-economic variables
Socio-economic variables include social class, terminal education age and
income. Here we shall look at social class as a predictor of buyer behaviour.
Social class is measured in varying ways and in European countries there
is debate over the best measures. A study in Sweden found occupational
complexity is more related to earnings than social class, and suggested skill
requirement and productivity as a better way to explain social stratification
(Tåhlin 2011; Darin-Mattsson et al. 2017). The European Socio￾economic Classification (ESeC) system shows how societies are
stratified, and is an indicator of the life chances of individuals and their
families and social inequalities (Rose and Harrison 2007). In the UK there
were two social economic classifications used for official statistics and
academic research (ONS 2022)–social class based on occupations, and socio￾economic groups–but these were replaced by the new National Statistics
Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) system. The NS-SEC measures
employment relations and occupations, to show the structure of society and
social behaviour (see Table 7.3). Social class measures tend to remain stable in
mature age segments and are comparable across countries (Barone et al. 2022).
TABLE 7.3 NS-SEC categories
1 Higher managerial, administrative and professional occupations:
 1.1 Large employers and higher managerial and administrative occupations
 1.2 Higher professional occupations
2 Lower managerial, administrative, and professional occupations3 Intermediate occupations
4 Small employers and own account workers
5 Lower supervisory and technical occupations
6 Semi-routine occupations
7 Routine occupations
8 Never worked and long-term unemployed
Source: ONS (2022)
Like the demographic variables, social class is relatively easy to determine
using occupations, and is widely used in marketing research for creating media
readership and viewership profiles, and for target marketing.
But you should be aware that people who hold similar occupations can
have very dissimilar lifestyles, values and purchasing patterns.
Terminal education age: according to research, inequalities in educational
achievement prevail into adult life, but an individual’s home location,
neighbourhood and peer environment will also impact on their lifetime
achievements (Thomson 2018). A UK study also found educational
achievement to be related to health, whereby men with no qualifications had
the lowest life expectancy and those with degree-level qualifications on
average lived 7.2 years longer (Ingleby et al. 2021). Using terminal
educational age and academic achievement is potentially relevant to
segmentation, as it is a predictor of income levels, health and well-being, but it
is a complex variable and there are many nuances to consider.
Income is a straightforward measure and suggests the level of disposable
resources available to an individual or household. Income measures represent
an important variable, which is also widely used in marketing research as a
determinant of life chances, focusing on monetary values rather than other
potentially conflicting variables, such as behavioural and psychographic
factors (Barone et al. 2022).
Geographic variables
The final set of segmentation variables is based on geographic differences. A
marketer can use pure geographic segmentation or a hybrid of geographic and
demographic variables called geodemographics.page 268
The geographic segmentation method is useful where there are geographic
locational differences in consumption patterns and preferences. For example,
variations in food preferences may form the basis of geographic segments;
differences in national advertising expectations may also form geographic
segments for communication purposes. Germans expect information in their
advertisements more than do French or British audiences. In the competitive
Asian car market, both Honda and Toyota launched ‘Asia-specific’ cars,
designed and marketed solely for Asian consumers, but they face emerging
competitors, such as Tata Motors in India, which manufactures cars
specifically for the home market (e.g. Nano, a small, affordable, reliable car
for Indian families) (Tata Motors 2009).
Geodemographics: in countries that produce population census data, the
potential for classifying consumers on the combined basis of location and
certain demographic (and socio-economic) information exists. Households are
classified into groups according to a wide range of factors, depending on what
is asked for on census returns.
In the UK, variables such as age, social status, family size, ethnic
background, joint income, type of housing and car ownership are used to group
small geographic areas (known as enumeration districts) into segments that
share similar characteristics. The two best-known geodemographic systems in
the UK are ACORN and Mosaic. Both use census data and postcodes to
produce categorizations of the population in the UK. See Table 7.4 for details
of the Mosaic system of classification. Research companies are also combining
lifestyle- and values-based segmentation schemes with geodemographic data.
For example, CACI’s system classifies segments using lifestyle and
geodemographic data. To find out more, visit www.caci.co.uk/about-caci.

ACORN is a powerful consumer classification that segments the UK
population. By analysing demographic data, social factors, population and
consumer behaviour, it provides precise information and an understanding of
different types of people (CACI 2022).
Mosaic is a classification system that provides insight into
geodemographics and lifestyles in more than 190 countries. In the UK, the
system classifies individuals, households and/or postcodes into homogeneous
consumer segments, and enables personalized multichannel targeting online
and offline. There are 141 Mosaic person types, which can be aggregated into
67 household types and 15 groups. The classification system can then be
overlaid onto a map of an area to show the areas in relation to the person types,
household types and groups (Experian 2022).
A major strength of geodemographic systems for marketers is their
capacity to link buyer behaviour to customer groups and locations. There is a
wide range of variables available to segment consumer markets. Often a
combination of variables will be used to identify groups of consumers that
respond in the same way to marketing mix strategies.
Further discussion of digital technology and social media can be found in
Chapter 15. Before looking at market positioning, we examine segmentation in

An important distinction between B2C and B2B segmentation is how markets
are segmented. In consumer markets targets are grouped using marketing￾relevant profiles. In B2B markets segmentation is based on two major
categories: macrosegmentation and microsegmentation (Plank 1985).
Macrosegmentation focuses on the characteristics of the buying
organization, such as size, industry and geographic location (see Figure 7.4).
Microsegmentation requires a more detailed level of market knowledge, as it
concerns the characteristics of decision-making within each macrosegment,
based on such factors as choice criteria, decision-making unit structure,
decision-making process, buy class, purchasing organization and
organizational innovativeness. Often B2B markets are first grouped on a
macrosegment basis and then finer subsegments are identified through
microsegmentation (Wind and Cardozo 1974).
FIGURE 7.4
Macrosegmentation and microsegmentation of B2B markets
Figure 7.4 shows how this two-stage process works. The choice of the
appropriate macrosegmentation and microsegmentation criteria is based on thepage 270
marketer’s evaluation of which criteria are most useful in predicting buyer
behaviour differences that have implications for developing marketing
strategies. Figure 7.5 shows how choice criteria can be used.
FIGURE 7.5
Segmenting B2B markets
Macrosegmentation
The key macrosegmentation criteria of organizational size, industry and
geographic location will now be discussed.
Organizational size
The size of buying organizations may be used to segment markets. Large
organizations differ from medium-sized and small organizations in having
greater order potential, more formalized buying and management processes,
increased specialization of function and special needs (e.g. quantity discounts).
The result is that they may form important target market segments
and require tailored marketing mix strategies. For example, the sales
force may need to be organized on a key account basis, where a dedicated salesteam is used to service important industrial accounts. List pricing of products
and services may need to consider the inevitable demand for volume discounts
from large purchasers, and the sales force team need to be well versed in the
art of negotiation.
Industry
Another common macrosegmentation variable is industry sector. Different
industries may have unique requirements from products. For example,
software application suppliers like Oracle and SAP can market their products
to various sectors, such as banking, manufacturing, healthcare and education,
each having unique needs in terms of software programs, servicing, price and
purchasing practices. By understanding each industry’s needs in depth, a more
effective marketing mix can be designed. In some instances, further
segmentation may be required. For example, the education sector may be
further divided into primary, secondary and further education, as the product
and service requirements of each may differ.
Geographic location
Regional variations in purchasing practice and needs may imply the use of
geographic location as a basis for differentiating marketing strategies. The
purchasing practices and expectations of companies in central and eastern
Europe are likely to differ markedly from those in western Europe. Their more
bureaucratic structures may imply a fundamentally different approach to doing
business that needs to be recognized by companies attempting to enter these
emerging B2B markets. In Chapter 2, we saw how different cultural factors
affect the purchasing practices in European countries. Cultural differences
should be reflected in marketing strategies targeting such segments.
Microsegmentation
Marketers may find it useful to divide each macrosegment into smaller
microsegments based on the buyer’s choice criteria, decision-making unit
structure, decision-making process, buy class, purchasing organization and
organizational innovativeness.
Choice criteriapage 271
B2B market segmentation is based on the key choice criteria used by buyers
when evaluating supplier offering. One group of customers may rate price as
the key choice criterion, another segment may favour productivity, while a
third may be service orientated. These varying preferences mean that
marketing and sales strategies need to be adapted to cater for each segment’s
needs. Three different marketing mixes would be needed to cover the three
segments, and salespeople would have to emphasize different benefits when
talking to customers in each segment. Variations in key choice criteria can be
powerful predictors of buyer behaviour. An important choice criterion for
business customers is value analysis, which considers not only price but also
other costs.
Michelin introduced CrossClimate 2 tyres to improve safety and year￾round driving. Princebuild, a UK construction and property firm, started fitting
these tyres on its company cars and vans. Fleet managers say ‘CrossClimate
tyres perform fantastically in the dry and wet, and in the event we get snow or
ice our drivers can keep mobile. They really notice the improved grip’ (Fleet
News 2021). See Exhibit 7.5 on the Michelin CrossClimate tyre.

Decision-making unit structure
Another way of segmenting B2B markets is based on decision-making unit
(DMU) composition: members of the DMU and its size may vary
between buying organizations. As discussed earlier in the chapter, theDMU consists of all those people in a buying organization who influence
supplier choice. One segment might be characterized by the influence of top
management on the decision, another by the role played by engineers, and a
third might comprise organizations where the purchasing manager plays the
key role. DMU size can also vary considerably: one segment might feature
large, complex units, while another might comprise single members.
Decision-making process
The decision-making process can take a long time or be relatively short. The
length of time is often correlated with DMU composition. Long processes are
associated with large DMUs. Where the decision time is long, high levels of
marketing expenditure may be needed, with considerable effort placed on
personal selling. Much less effort is needed when the buy process is relatively
short and where, perhaps, only the purchasing manager is involved.
Buy class
B2B purchases can be categorized into straight rebuy, modified rebuy and new
task. The buy class affects the length of the decision-making process, the
complexity of the DMU and the number of choice criteria that are used in
supplier selection. It can therefore be used as a predictor of different forms of
buyer behaviour, and hence is useful as a segmentation variable.
Purchasing organization
Decentralized versus centralized purchasing is another microsegmentation
variable because of its influence on the purchase decision (McCue and Pitzer
2000). Centralized purchasing involves purchasing specialists who become
experts in buying a range of products. Specialization means they are more
familiar with cost factors, and strengths and weaknesses of suppliers, than
decentralized generalists. Centralized volume buying means a stronger power
base to demand price concessions in negotiation with suppliers. Also there is
greater power within the DMU in terms of technical people like engineers than
there is with decentralized buyers, who often lack the specialist expertise and
status to challenge their preferences. In addition, a centralized purchasing
segment could be served by a national account sales force, whereas a
decentralized purchasing segment might be covered by territory
representatives. Decentralized purchasing does also have strengths, such asgreater flexibility as departments can purchase items, lower investment
required, increased range of production options can be considered, quicker
delivery of smaller quantities of products, can adapt to localized cultural
variations.
Organizational innovativeness
A key segmentation variable when launching new products is the degree of
innovativeness of potential buyers. In Chapter 11 we discuss the characteristics
of innovator firms. Marketers need to identify the specific characteristics of the
innovator segment, since these companies should be targeted first when new
products are launched. Follower firms may be willing to buy the product, but
only after the innovators have approved it. Although categorized here as a
microsegmentation variable, it should be borne in mind that organizational size
(a macrosegmentation variable) may be a predictor of innovativeness too.
Table 7.5 summarizes the methods of segmenting B2B markets, and
provides examples of how each variable can be used to form segments.

Target Marketing
Market segmentation is a means to an end: target marketing. This is the
choice of specific segments to serve and is a key element in marketing
strategy. A firm needs to evaluate segments, and decide which ones to serve
and how to access each market. For example, US Cable News Network (CNN)
targets its news programmes at what are known as ‘influentials’, and provides
firms with access to highly valuable, segmented and targeted audiences in the
travel, business and finance, sport, technology, luxury goods and auto
industries (CNN 2022).
Premium mixer drinks brand Fever-Tree worked with a Dutch creative
agency to create an advertising campaign that targeted gin drinkers (see
Exhibit 7.6). Focusing on the summer season, the campaign’s ‘pairing wheel’
brought together dozens of gin brands with Fever-Tree’s top tonic brands
(Feeley 2019). Read Marketing in Action 7.4 to discover how Coca-Cola
benefited from very precise target marketing.

MARKETING IN ACTION 7.4
Create a Global Target Market Campaign, Share-a-Coke and Bridge a Racial Divide
Coca-Cola created a groundbreaking campaign that (with spin-off projects) ran for more
than 10 years. The Share-a-Coke campaign started as Project Connect, targeting young
adult Australians. The campaign focused on ‘sharing moments of happiness’, and the brand
name on the bottle was replaced with individual personal names, to give very precise target
marketing. In the first summer of the campaign, more than 250 million named bottles of
Coke were sold. There was overwhelming demand for personalized bottles of Coke and its
success was due to giving ‘consumers the opportunity to express themselves through a
bottle [of Coke]’ (Moye 2016). The campaign then added online messaging with
#ShareaCoke, which boosted sales even further. By 2021, the campaign had reached 70-
plus countries and spread across the globe. In South Africa, Coke’s marketing team found a
particular challenge: there are over 11 official languages and many individuals cannot
pronounce one another’s names. Coke’s campaign team identified targeted markets of
people who had experienced racial segregation, aged 13–19 and 20–29. The campaign
was about social cohesion and respect. Radio adverts broadcast stories about
mispronunciation of names, Coke became a ‘teacher and change-maker’, and found a way
to bridge the language divide. The highly successful campaign increased brand
consumption by 27 per cent and saw a 5.4 per cent growth in Coca-Cola sales in the region.

The Share-a-Coke campaign demonstrates how careful and precise targeting can generate
global success, with scope to tailor marketing messages for local markets.

Entering markets can be costly, especially when products need to be
altered, so it is important to take care in selecting target markets that will meet
marketing objectives. We first examine how to evaluate potential market
segments and then consider how to make a balanced choice about which
markets to serve.page 273
Evaluating market segments
When evaluating market segments, a company should examine two broad
issues: market attractiveness and the company’s capability to compete in the
segment. Market attractiveness can be assessed by looking at market
factors, competitive factors, and political, social and environmental
factors (Hooley et al. 2012). Figures 7.6 and 7.7 illustrate the factors that need
to be examined when evaluating market segments.
FIGURE 7.6
Factors used to assess market attractivenesspage 274
FIGURE 7.7
Factors used to assess the company’s capability to compete
Market factors
Segment size: generally, large-sized segments are more attractive than small
ones, since sales potential is greater and the chance of achieving economies of
scale is improved. However, large segments are highly sought after and can be
very competitive, so firms need extensive resources. Smaller firms may not
have the resources to compete in large segments and so may find smaller
segments more attractive.
Segment growth rate: growing segments are more attractive than stagnant
or declining segments, as new business opportunities will be greater. Chinese
firms LONGi Solar, JinkoSolar and JA Solar are competing in the rapidly
expanding solar energy systems market. Climate change, net-zero emissions
targets, rapidly rising energy prices and political unrest in Europe are
macroenvironmental factors contributing to the boom in renewable energies.
Therefore, analysis of growth rate should always be accompanied by an
examination of the state of competition and the factors driving growth.
Segment profitability: the potential to make profits is an important factor in
market attractiveness.
Price sensitivity: in segments where customers are price sensitive, there is
a danger of profit margins being eroded by price competition. Low price-sensitive segments are usually more attractive since margins can be
maintained. Competition may be based more on quality and other non-price
factors.
Bargaining power of customers: both end and intermediate customers (e.g.
distributors) can reduce the attraction of a market segment if they can exert
high bargaining pressure on suppliers. The result is usually a reduction in
profit margins as customers (e.g. supermarket chains) negotiate lower prices in
return for placing large orders.
Bargaining power of suppliers: a firm must assess not only the negotiating
muscle of its customers but also its potential suppliers in the new segment.
Where supply is in the hands of a few dominant companies, the segment will
be less attractive than when served by many competing suppliers.
Barriers to market segment entry: for companies considering entering a
new segment there may be substantial entry barriers that reduce its
attractiveness. Barriers can take the form of the high marketing expenditures
necessary to compete, patents or high switching costs for customers. However,
if a company judges that it can afford or overcome barriers to entry, its
existence may raise segment attractiveness if the company judges that the
barriers will deter new rivals from entering.
Barriers to market segment exit: a segment may be regarded as less
attractive if there are high barriers to exit. Exit barriers may take the form of
specialized production facilities that cannot easily be liquidated, or agreements
to provide spare parts to customers. Their presence may make exit extremely
expensive and therefore segment entry riskier.
Competitive factors
Nature of competition: segments characterized by strong aggressive
competition are less attractive than where competition is weak. The weakness
of European and North American car manufacturers made Japanese entry into
a seemingly highly competitive (in terms of number of manufacturers) market
segment relatively easy. The quality of the competition is far more significant
than the number of companies operating in a market segment.
New entrants: a segment may seem superficially attractive because of the
lack of current competition, but care must be taken to assess the dynamics of
the market. A judgement must be made regarding the likelihood of new
entrants, possibly with new technology, which might change the rules of thepage 275
competitive game (e.g. Google changed the rules in the online advertising
market with the introduction of Google Ads).
Competitive differentiation: segments will be more attractive if there is a
real probability of creating a differentiated market position. This judgement is
dependent on identifying unserved customer requirements and the capability of
the company to meet the value requirements of the customers. As digital
technologies develop, and environmental factors become more important,
values are changing and there are many emerging market opportunities. In the
electric vehicle (EV) market, battery life and reliable distance travelled are
valued key success factors. Existing and new market entrants vie for position
in a market initially dominated by Tesla, which released its first car in 2008; in
test conditions its Roadster travelled 245 miles on a single
charge. Projections suggest demand for EVs will grow from 4.8
million to more than 40 million by 2026. Government regulations, consumer
behaviour and technology are factors driving this growth, and Tesla is coming
under pressure from three types of competitors: existing auto manufacturers
(Ford, VW, Toyota), EV new market entrants (NIO, Lucid, Rivian) and big
tech (Apple, Amazon) (Anon 2022). As the market grows, competition
intensifies and opportunities to differentiate become increasingly sparse.
Political, social, environmental and technological factors
Political issues: political forces can open new market segments. Across the
world government plans focus on reducing carbon emissions in response to
climate change. In the UK, the government’s plan to ‘Build Back Greener’ is
designed to tackle climate change, stabilize energy prices, ensure cleaner and
more efficient use of energy, and promote recovery from the Covid-19
pandemic (HM Government 2021). This plan impacts on travel and
transportation, building regulations, how we heat our homes, and power
manufacturing. According to research (Allas et al. 2021), resulting areas of
opportunity for business are:
Reducing emissions: firms operating in agriculture, raw material extraction,
mining, heavy manufacturing and transport industries can make a significant
impact on overall emissions if they reduce the negative outputs from their
operations. There are likely to be high initial costs, so gains in these sectors
must be considered as longer-term investment in environmental benefits and
business sustainability.Selling green goods and services: business opportunities providing net-zero
solutions (e.g. machinery, electronics) are predicted to grow globally as
construction, services, transport, technology industries and more seek low￾carbon solutions. In the UK, offshore wind farms and greening of transport
systems have already shown potential and expertise in financial, profession,
scientific, information technology, pharmaceuticals and aerospace areas
identified for future growth.
Helping others in the value chain to reduce emissions: key opportunities
exist in B2B markets. Sustainable brands in FMCG, apparel and beauty
industries are creating new profitable value propositions. Consumers are
increasingly looking for sustainably packaged, delivered and marketed
goods.
Other considerations are that the attraction of entering new geographic
segments may be reduced if political instability exists or is forecast, for
example unrest in Ukraine and Russia has impacted on travel and tourism.
Globally, the travel industry had been starting to benefit from the relaxation of
Covid-19 pandemic travel restrictions, but this new uncertainty is again
disrupting travel markets, especially in eastern Europe. In 2019, Hungary and
Poland saw about 900,000 visitors to their regions, but this has reduced to a
third of that number, and the growth in visitors from China that had been seen
before the pandemic has collapsed. Such uncertainties as war and threats to
personal health, rising travel costs and rises in cost of living are stalling the
return to growth for travel industries in eastern Europe (Muller 2022).
Social trends: changes in society need to be assessed to measure their
likely impact on the market segment. Changes can give rise to latent market
segments, underserved by current products and services. For example,
changing perceptions of gender roles means reviewing who is the main income
earner in a household (traditionally male) and who is responsible for childcare
(traditionally women). These changing patterns of family life mean that
women are working more, and men are more likely to be actively involved in
parenting. Fathers are often overlooked as a target market, but they are
increasingly influencing brand choices. New dads are taking responsibility for
decisions in the home, and tend to look for healthier and more environmentally
friendly products. Behavioural science research suggests it is important for
marketers to strike a balance between dad as a parent and as a man (Fleck
2018), but also to be aware that gender stereotyping should be avoided
(Friedmann 2018).page 276
Environmental issues: the trend towards more environmentally friendly
products has affected market attractiveness both positively and negatively. The
Body Shop took the opportunity afforded by the movement against animal
testing of cosmetics and toiletries; conversely, the market for
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has declined in the face of scientific evidence
linking their emission with depletion of the ozone layer. Unilever relaunched
its popular laundry brand Persil with a 100 per cent recyclable container, plant￾based stain removers and biodegradable ingredients (Unilever 2022).
Technology issues: digital technologies are now ubiquitous and part of
almost every aspect of modern life. These technologies are affecting how we
consume, what we consume, and when and where we consume goods and
services, and should not be overlooked as new market segments are constantly
emerging and big gains can be made by first entrants. For example, during the
Covid-19 pandemic, Zoom sparked a battle in the videoconferencing
communications market, taking a lead with consumers, which saw the firm
grow significantly and establish a dominant market position. Following the
pandemic and as workers return to the office, Zoom faces competitive
challenges from large established tech companies, such as Cisco Systems and
Microsoft Teams, which have gained prominence with professional and large
enterprises.
Capability
Against the market attractiveness factors must be placed the company’s
capability to serve the market segment. The market segment may be attractive
but outside the resources of the company. Capability may be assessed by
analysing exploitable marketing assets, cost advantages, technological edge,
and managerial capabilities and commitment.
Exploitable marketing assets: does the market segment allow the firm to
exploit its current marketing strengths? For example, is segment entry
consonant with the image of its brands or does it provide distribution
synergies? However, where new segment entry is inconsistent with image, a
new brand name may be created. For example, Toyota developed the Lexus
model name when entering the upper-middle-class executive car segment.Cost advantages: companies can exploit cheaper material, labour or
technological cost advantages to achieve a low-cost position compared with
the competition, which may put them in a strong position, particularly if the
segment is price sensitive.
Technological edge: strength may also be derived by superior technology,
which is the source of differential advantage in the market segment. Patent
protection (e.g. in pharmaceuticals) can form the basis of a strong defensible
position, leading to high profitability. During the pandemic, some changes
occurred to this type of protection. AstraZeneca, for example, lifted patent
restrictions for its Covid-19 vaccines to enable more widespread production of
vital vaccines, which were made under licence by collaborations such as that
between Serum Institute of India and Oxford/AstraZeneca (David 2021). For
some firms, segment entry may be deferred if they do not possess the resources
to invest in technological leadership.
Managerial capabilities and commitment: a segment may look attractive,
but a realistic assessment of managerial capabilities and skills may lead to
rejection of entry. The technical and judgement skills of management may be
insufficient to compete against strong competitors. Furthermore, the segment
needs to be assessed from the viewpoint of managerial objectives. Successful
marketing depends on implementation. Without the commitment of
management, segment entry will fail on the altar of neglect.
Target marketing strategies
The purpose of evaluating market segments is to choose one or more segments
to enter. Target market selection is the choice of which and how many market
segments to compete in. There are four generic target marketing strategies
from which to choose: undifferentiated marketing, differentiated marketing,
focused marketing and customized marketing (see Figure 7.8). Each option
will now be examined.
FIGURE 7.8
Target marketing strategiespage 277
Undifferentiated marketing
Occasionally, a market analysis will show no strong differences in customer
characteristics that have implications for marketing strategy. Alternatively, the
cost of developing a separate market mix for separate segments may outweigh
the potential gains of meeting customer needs more exactly. Under these
circumstances, a firm may decide to develop a single marketing mix for the
whole market. This absence of segmentation is called undifferentiated
marketing or a mass marketing approach. This strategy can occur by default.
For example, firms lacking a market orientation may practise undifferentiated
marketing through lack of customer knowledge, but such firms may struggle to
survive in the longer term. FMCG brands, commodities, fuel and dairy
products are often cited as pursuing undifferentiated marketing strategies, but
this is rather confusing. Coca-Cola has a global brand position (mass market)
but specifically targets local markets, sometimes adapting advertising (see
Marketing in Action 7.4), packaging and communication channels but not
generally the product (geographically differentiated).Proactively taking a mass-market approach can be beneficial, bringing cost
savings, and giving market reach and widespread brand recognition. Brightly
coloured chocolate candies M&M’s have customers around the globe talking
about the brand and its characters. Mars, which owns the M&M’s brand, uses
distinctive mass marketing to promote the candy (see Exhibit 7.7). However,
customer loyalty can be low, with customers easily brand-switching, creating
opportunities for competing brands.
EXHIBIT 7.7

The process of market segmentation is normally the motivator to move
such companies from practising undifferentiated marketing to one of the next
three target marketing strategies.
Differentiated marketing
When market segmentation reveals several potential targets, specific marketing
mixes can be developed to appeal to all or some of the segments. This is called
differentiated marketing. For example, airlines design different marketing
mixes for first-class and economy passengers, including varying prices, service
levels, quality of food, in-cabin comfort and waiting areas at airports. A
differentiated target marketing strategy exploits the differences between
marketing segments by designing a specific marketing mix for each segment.
One potential disadvantage of a differentiated compared with an
undifferentiated marketing strategy is the loss of cost economies. However, the
use of flexible manufacturing systems can minimize such problems.page 278
Focused marketing
The identification of several segments in a market does not imply a company
should serve all of them. Some may be unattractive or out of line with business
strengths. Perhaps the most sensible route is to serve just one of the market
segments. When a company develops a single marketing mix aimed at one
target market (niche) it is practising focused marketing.
This strategy is particularly appropriate for companies with limited
resources. Small companies may stretch their resources too far by competing
in more than one segment. Focused marketing allows research and
development expenditure to be concentrated on meeting the needs of one set of
customers, and managerial activities can be devoted to understanding and
catering for their needs. Large organizations may not be interested in serving
the needs of this one segment, or their energies may be so dissipated across the
whole market that they pay insufficient attention to their requirements.
An example of focused marketing in the consumer market is given by
Bang & Olufsen (B&O), the Danish audio electronics firm. It targets upmarket
consumers, who value self-development, pleasure and open-mindedness, with
its stylish TV and music systems. B&O describes its positioning as ‘high
quality but we are not Rolls-Royce–more BMW’. The company places
emphasis on distinctive design, good quality and simplicity of use. Focused
targeting means that B&O defies the conventional wisdom that a small
manufacturer could not make profits marketing consumer electronics in
Denmark (Bang & Olufsen 2018).
One form of focused marketing is to concentrate efforts on the relatively
small percentage of customers that account for a disproportionately large share
of sales of a product (the heavy buyers). For example, in some markets, 20 per
cent of customers account for 80 per cent of sales. Some companies aim at
such a segment because it is so superficially attractive. Unfortunately, though,
they may be falling victim to the ‘majority fallacy’ (Zikmund and D’Amico
1999). The majority fallacy is the name given to the blind pursuit of the
largest, most easily identified, market segment. It is a fallacy because that
segment is the one everyone in the past has recognized as the best segment
and, therefore, it attracts the most intense competition. The result is likely to be
high marketing expenditures, price-cutting and low profitability. A moresensible strategy may be to target a small, seemingly less attractive, segment
rather than choose the same customers that everyone else is after.
Customized marketing
Customized marketing refers more specifically to organizational target
market. In some industrial markets, the requirements of individual customers
are unique and their purchasing power sufficient to make designing a separate
marketing mix for each customer viable. Segmentation at this disaggregated
level leads to the use of customized marketing. Many service providers, such
as advertising and marketing research agencies, architects and solicitors, and
IT solutions providers, vary their offerings on a customer-to-customer basis.
They will discuss face to face with each customer their requirements and tailor
their services accordingly. Customized marketing is also found within
organizational markets, because of the high value of orders and the special
needs of customers.
As the world changes and the digital products, services, channels, media
and platforms become integrated into a firm’s activity, the focus of marketing
activities are changing and providing new opportunities for target marketing.
Now read Mini Case 7.1, which considers a paradigm shift from target
marketing to customer-based ecosystems.
MINI CASE 7.1
Digital Ecosystems, Communities and Tribes
In consumer and industrial markets, value is often expressed through the impact of a
product or service on an individual’s lifestyle or business performance. Competitive success
is achieved by connecting desired values with delivered products and/or services to meet
customer needs. Since much of the world’s business activity has gone digital, the speed of
change in product and service innovations has increased rapidly, concomitantly increasing
every customer’s expectations. To constantly create differentiated customer value, firms
need to move beyond traditional value chain systems and work with a network of firms and
customers (Wang 2021). Business ecosystems are developing that enable brands to build a
consolidated group of customers. Digital brands (e.g. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet,
Alibaba) have established the most successful and powerful ecosystems. Firms using more
traditional marketing approaches will need to shift their thinking about customers if they are
to build successful ecosystems. There are two key considerations:
1. look at customers from end-to-end of a customer journeypage 279
2. identify touchpoints along the customer journey.
Then ecosystem creators need to find exclusive partners, provide incentives and build a
system that adds value across the journey and at key touchpoints, for example Uber (ride￾sharing platform) partnered with GoBank to give drivers in the US bank accounts, and
partnered with Holvi in Finland to make it easier for drivers to manage their finances and run
their businesses. The banks thus gained access to a many new customers and the platform
(Uber) earned revenue by connecting these parties.
Ecosystems encourage consideration of different types of customers, moving away from
targeting carefully researched and crafted segments to more organic groups of online
customers.
Online brand communities
Online social networks have facilitated the growth of brand communities, which are
becoming an increasingly important marketing phenomenon. These digital forums provide a
perfect place for like-minded consumers to congregate and co-produce shared value.
Interestingly, such communities have gained power in their relationship with brands and are
somewhat empowered, almost to the extent that they manage the brands by producing their
own interpretations of a brand, its value and market position. At the technological extremes,
online communities are creating their own brands and products, for example Linux (open
source operating system) and geocaching (a global treasure hunt, followed and created by
its treasure-hunting users). There is also a darker side marketers should be
aware of: if strong online communities become dissatisfied with a brand–they
may even feel exploited by pricing policies and value offers–they may rebel by boycotting
the brand, openly criticizing it and supporting competitor brands.
Tribes
The concept of tribal marketing offers a new way of thinking about segmentation and target
markets. From a marketing viewpoint, a tribe is made up of a network of individuals who are
linked together by shared beliefs about a brand. A tribe can offer an innovative way to
identify customers and to cut through the increasingly fragmented nature of society. Tribes
are different to segments in that members share feelings, passions and beliefs rather than
similar demographic variables. They form groups similar to ‘clans’, and these groupings are
not defined by age or other demographic variables. Brand tribes can be built around a
strong association with a product.
Research in the UK found 71 per cent of the population said they were middle class, but this
very large section of the population represented a wide spectrum of incomes, wealth and
attitudes. Six distinct tribes were identified, showing different attitudes towards brand
preferences. For example, ‘squeezed strugglers’ liked Gillette and ITV but disliked the
National Trust and Sainsbury’s; ‘bargain hunters’ liked eBay and Müller but disliked John
Lewis; ‘Daily Mail disciplinarians’ liked British Airways but disliked L’Oréal and Channel 4;
‘comfortable greens’ liked Fairtrade and Green & Black’s but disliked Asda and Coca-Cola
(Chorley and Rentoul 2011). There is however more to being part of a tribe than liking or
disliking a particular brand.
Unilever used the concept of tribalism and the medium of social media to create a tribe
called the Marmarati–a group of consumers who were so passionate about Marmite XO
(especially strong) that they were prepared to publicly demonstrate their love of the product
through Facebook and Twitter. The approach created excitement around the product both
online and offline.
Games Workshop has built its global business by connecting Warhammer gaming fanatics,
who recreate battles and conflicts with its fantasy figures. Warhammer gamers are apassionate tribe, committed to their war game hobby. At Warhammer World in Lenton,
Nottingham, where the brand originated, there is an event centre that attracts tribe
members from across the world. Gamers devote time and money, and have a lot to say
about what they expect from the brand by working together. Games Workshop now
produces regular releases of new products, which are showcased on play tables in-stores,
where staff give lessons in game strategy and practical advice on painting the models, all of
which creates value for the tribe of customers.
To create a successful tribe, marketers need to identify what it is that brings these
individuals together. Tribes are not homogeneous like segments; they are linked by passion
for a brand and are capable of collective action. Tribes are fuzzy, more like societal sparkle
than socio-economic certainty, and so can be difficult to identify, but technology is helping
expand online communities.
Questions:
1. Discuss the potential significance of online brand communities for a new brand.
2. Explain how tribal marketing differs from segmentation and target marketing.
3. Choose a brand and suggest how you would create a tribe for it.

Positioning
So far, we have discussed market segmentation and target market selection.
The next step in developing an effective marketing strategy is to clearly
position a product or service offering in the marketplace. Figure 7.9
summarizes the key tasks involved and shows where positioning fits into the
process. Positioning is the choice of:
target market–where we want to compete
differential advantage–how we wish to compete.
FIGURE 7.9
Key tasks in positioningpage 280
Both elements of positioning should be considered in conjunction with
customer needs. The objective is to create and maintain a distinctive place in
the market for a company and/or its products.
Target market selection has accomplished part of the positioning job
already. But to compete successfully in a target market involves providing the
customer with a differential advantage (see Exhibit 7.8, which describes how
Glacéau Water is positioned as a problem-solver). This requires giving the
target customer something better than the competition. Creating a differential
advantage is discussed in detail in Chapter 18. Briefly, it involves using the
marketing mix to create something special for the customer. Product
differentiation may result from added features that give customers benefits
rivals cannot match. Promotional differentiation may stem from unique, valued
images created by advertising, or superior service provided by salespeople.
EXHIBIT 7.8

providing solutions that match their preferencesSource: The Image Party/Shutterstock
Distribution differentiation may arise through making the buy situation
more convenient for customers. Finally, price differentiation may involve
giving superior value for money through lower prices.
A landmark book by Ries and Trout (2001) suggested that marketers are
involved in a battle for the minds of target customers. Successful positioning is
often associated with products possessing favourable connotations in the
minds of customers. For example, Apple Inc. is associated with high
technology, innovative design, reliable and fashionable mobile phones, tablets,
watches and more. These add up to a differential advantage in the minds of its
target customers, whether they are in London, Amsterdam or New York.
Similarly, the success of FMCG brand Cillit Bang has been based on its
positioning as the most powerful and versatile household cleaner on the
market. Such positioning is hard won and relies on four factors, as shown in
Figure 7.10 and listed below.
1. Clarity: the positioning idea must be clear in terms of both target market and
differential advantage. Complicated positioning statements are unlikely to
be remembered. Simple messages such as Walmart’s ‘always low prices’ and
Stella Artois’ ‘reassuringly expensive’ are clear and memorable.
2. Consistency: people are bombarded with messages daily. To break through
this noise, a consistent message is required. Confusion will arise if the
position is based on ‘quality of service’ then changed to ‘superior product
performance’. Some brands establish enduring market positions based on
consistency of message. L’Oréal maintained the consistency of its
messaging and celebrated 50 years of its ‘because you’re worth it’. Thepage 281
brand claims this is not just a slogan but a mission for the brand (L’Oréal
2022). Another example of a brand benefiting from communicating a
consistent message for 30 years is Gillette (razors), which always aims to
provide the best products, and used the slogan ‘the best a man can get’ to
communicate with its target audience. However, the brand ended up at the
centre of a controversy when changing the slogan to ‘the best men can be’,
with the aim of making a social comment and holding men accountable for
their negative actions (Baggs 2019). This change of position of the brand’s
marketing communication messaging, introducing a societal stance, was
arguably a tactical marketing failure and there was much negative reaction,
especially across social media platforms where likes very quickly turned
into dislikes. This was an expensive mistake in terms of both the opportunity
cost of advertising spend and reputational damage (Ritson 2019). Both
L’Oréal and Gillette receive high recall when consumers are
researched because of the consistent use of a simple message over
many years, despite Gillette’s mistake.
3. Credibility: the differential advantage that is chosen must be credible in the
mind of the target customer. The extent to which a brand is trusted largely
determines customer loyalty and satisfaction, so to retain credibility brands
should seek to be honest, open and respectful, and identify with positive
human traits. Some of the most trusted brands include Pampers (baby care),
Visa (payments), Microsoft (technology solutions) and FedEx (logistics)
(Kantar 2020).
4. Competitiveness: the differential advantage should have a competitive edge.
It should offer something of value to the customer that the competition is
failing to supply (see discussion of competitive factors above and in Chapter
18). For example, Fever-Tree’s range of mixer drinks has become a market￾leading and award-winning brand, which filled a gap in the market for
premium-quality tonic to accompany the growing number of premium
brands of gin, whisky, vodka and other spirits.
FIGURE 7.10
Keys to successful positioning: the 4-Cs frameworkPerceptual mapping
A useful tool for determining the position of a brand in the marketplace is the
perceptual map–a visual representation of consumer perceptions of the brand
and its competitors using attributes (dimensions) that are important to
consumers. The key steps in developing a perceptual map are as follows:
1. Identify a set of competing brands.
2. Identify important attributes that consumers use when choosing between
brands, using qualitative research (e.g. group discussions).
3. Conduct quantitative marketing research where consumers score each brand
on all key attributes.
4. Plot brands on a two-dimensional map(s).
Figure 7.11 shows a perceptual map for seven supermarket chains.
Qualitative marketing research has shown that consumers evaluate
supermarkets on two key dimensions: price and width of product range.
Quantitative marketing research is then carried out using scales that measure
consumers’ perceptions of each supermarket on these dimensions. Average
scores are then plotted on a perceptual map.
FIGURE 7.11
A perceptual map of supermarket chainsThe results in Figure 7.11 show the supermarkets are grouped into two
clusters: the high price, wide product range group, and the low price, narrow
product range group. These are indicative of two market segments and show
that supermarkets C and D are close rivals, as measured by consumer
perceptions, and have very distinct perceptual positions in the marketplace
compared with E, F and G.
Perceptual maps are useful in considering strategic moves. For example, an
opportunity may exist to create a differential advantage based on a
combination of wide product range and low prices (as shown by the theoretical
position at X).
Perceptual maps can also be valuable in identifying the strengths and
weaknesses of brands as perceived by consumers. Such findings can be very
revealing to managers, whose own perceptions may differ markedly from those
of consumers. Consumers can also be asked to score their ideal position on
each of the attributes so that actual and ideal positions can be compared.
Spidergram analysis
An alternative approach to perceptual mapping for understanding the position
of a brand in the marketplace is spidergram analysis, which provides analysis
with a visual representation of consumer perceptions of the brand and its
competitors using attributes (dimensions) that are important to consumers
when evaluating those brands. However, this analysis also asks consumers topage 282
rate the importance of the attributes, and the relative importance of these is
then represented visually by the length of the spoke on the spidergram.
The key steps are as follows:
1. Identify a set of competing brands.
2. Identify important attributes that consumers use when choosing between
brands, using qualitative research (e.g. group discussions).
3. Conduct quantitative marketing research in which consumers:
a) rate the importance of each attribute in their choice between brands on a
10-point scale
b) score each brand on all key attributes on a 10-point scale.
4. Plot brands on a spidergram.
Figure 7.12 shows a spidergram positioning map for the robotic systems
market. The length of each spoke is proportional to the importance ratings of
each attribute. Functionality is considered an essential attribute and has
received a score of 10; the least important attribute is financing, scoring only
3. Each spoke is divided into 10 sections and each brand’s score is plotted on
each attribute. Our brand has received higher perceptual scores than its nearest
competitor for functionality, customization, crisis help and delivery. Our brand
and its nearest competitor are similarly rated for after-sales service, but for
installation, price and financing, our nearest competitor is rated more highly.
Since our company is rated more highly on those attributes that are more
important to consumers, it is likely that our brand has a larger market share
than its nearest competitor.
FIGURE 7.12
A spidergram positioning map for the robotic systems marketLike a perceptual map, spidergram analysis is valuable in identifying how
consumers (as opposed to managers) perceive the strengths and weaknesses of
competing brands. It provides a visual portrayal of the positions of brands
along multiple dimensions.
Repositioning
Occasionally a product or service will need to be repositioned because of
changing customer tastes or poor sales performance. Repositioning involves
changing the target markets, the differential advantage, or both.
A useful framework for analysing repositioning options is given in Figure
7.13. Using product differentiation and target market as the key variables, four
generic repositioning strategies are shown.
FIGURE 7.13
Repositioning strategiespage 283
Image repositioning
The first option is to keep product and target market the same, but change the
image of the product. In markets where products act as a form of self￾expression, the product may be acceptable in functional terms but fail because
it lacks the required image. Many organizations–from McDonald’s to low-cost
airlines like Ryanair to giant industrial corporations like BASF, the German
chemical company–have changed their image by altering business practices to
be perceived as sustainable, environmentally friendly and better able to meet
the needs of the target audience (Eletheriou-Smith 2011). Britvic invested in its
marketing spend to improve its digital marketing activity, to find new market
growth opportunities, and to ensure the correct positioning for all of its popular
soft drinks brands. Rockstar, its energy drink, repositioned to move away from
its immature image and digital asset to help boost sales. The energy drinks
sector is worth more than £1.4 billion and growing (Pham 2021), so Britvic’s
CEO saw this as an ideal marketing investment.
Product repositioning
With this strategy, the product is changed while the target market remains the
same. Responding to changing tastes, consumer preferences and climate
change, Starbucks committed to repositioning the brand to a ‘plant
positive’ future. To achieve the firm’s goals, it has committed to
‘giving back more than it takes from the planet’, which means reducing waste,
making reusable cups more accessible, introducing electric vehicles to move
supplies, and more. Changes to the product offer, too, with more plant-based
alternatives, are encouraging its existing customers to consume fewer dairy
products (Starbucks 2022).
Intangible repositioning
This strategy involves targeting a different market segment with the same
product. Cadbury’s chocolate is a British heritage brand with a history
stretching back over 200 years. In its recent marketing history, the brand has
been defined as ‘providing moments of joy’, with iconic campaigns like that
featuring a drum-playing gorilla, but the ‘joy’ positioning has lost its edge–and
customers. In 2018, Cadbury developed a new market position for its well￾established products, which focused on ‘genuine acts of kindness and
generosity’ and targeted gift-buying markets. The brand’s marketingexecutives wanted the market position to be more human, more real and to
make connections with the chocolate manufacturer’s roots. Founder John
Cadbury was philanthropist and known for his kindness. The new position was
underpinned by a multimedia campaign using TV, digital channels, social
media, PR and sales promotions (Roderick 2018).
Tangible repositioning
When both product and target market are changed, a company is practising
tangible repositioning. For example, a company may decide to move upmarket
or downmarket by introducing a new range of products to meet the needs of
the new target customers.
Successful tangible repositioning was undertaken by Samsung Electronics,
from selling undifferentiated TVs and microwaves to all age groups, to a
premium-priced range of consumer technologies (e.g. flat-screen TVs and
mobile handsets). Looking to the future, the brand is changing its products and
its target market to an ‘everyday sustainable’ market position producing eco￾conscious products: solar cells. The technology manufacturer will also ensure
all of its TVs are packed using recycled materials and its technology products
are recycled (Samsung 2022).
Building an Effective Marketing Mix
Once the strategic work is complete on segmentation, targeting and
positioning, the outputs can inform the tactical actions needed to implement
marketing initiatives. There are four hallmarks for developing an effective
marketing mix (see Figure 7.14).
FIGURE 7.14
Hallmarks of an effective marketing mixpage 284
The marketing mix matches customer needs
Sensible marketing mix decisions can be made only when the target customer
is identified and understood. Once the target market(s) is identified, marketing
management needs to understand how customers choose between rival
offerings so they can develop a market position. Managers should consider the
product or service through customers’ eyes and consider segmentation
variables and choice criteria (discussed in Chapter 4), which inform how
individuals and firms in the market might behave.
Figure 7.15 illustrates the link between customer choice criteria and the
marketing mix. The starting point is the realization that customers evaluate
products on economic and psychological criteria. Economic criteria include
factors such as performance, availability, reliability, durability and productivity
gains to be made by using the product. Examples of psychological criteria are
self-image, a desire for a quiet life, pleasure, convenience and
risk reduction (see Chapter 4). The important point at this stage is
to note that an analysis of customer choice criteria reveals a set of key
customer requirements that must be met to succeed in the marketplace.
Meeting or exceeding these requirements better than the competition leads to
the creation of a competitive advantage.
FIGURE 7.15
Matching the marketing mix to individual customer needsThe marketing mix creates a competitive
advantage
A competitive advantage is the achievement of superior performance through
differentiation to provide superior customer value or by managing to achieve
lowest delivered cost. Competitive advantage can be derived from decisions
about the Four-Ps and the extended service mix. For example:
Product: Apple Inc. is known for delivering superior quality products, which
incorporate innovative designs and new technologies (e.g. iPhone, iTunes,
MacBook, Apple Watch).
Price: Lidl and Aldi, German supermarket chains, achieve a competitive
advantage by severely controlling costs, limiting the range of products
available and using minimum staffing, allowing them to make profits even
though their prices are low, a strategy attractive to price-sensitive shoppers.
Promotion: the strategy of using advertising as a tool for competitive
advantage is often employed when product benefits are particularly
subjective and amorphous in nature. Advertising for perfumes like those by
Chanel, Givenchy, Hermès and Marc Jacobs is critical in preserving the
exclusive image established by such brands.
Place: distribution decisions need to be made with the customer in mind,
not only in terms of availability but also with respect to service levels,
image and customer convenience. The Radisson SAS hotel at Manchester
Airport creates competitive advantage through customer convenience. It is
situated 5 minutes’ walk from the airport terminals, which are reached by
covered walkways, while guests at rival hotels must rely on taxis or transit
buses to reach the airport.
People: Disney is in the entertainment business, and its stores, theme parks,
cruise ships and hotels focus on providing the best customer service, to givepage 285
customers magical experiences. The brand wins many industry awards in
recognition of its customer experience excellence (e.g. Live Entertainment
Excellence Award, IAAPA 2021).
Process: fast-food restaurants need efficient processing systems to allow
customers to enjoy speedy service. Taco Bell, Burger King, McDonald’s,
Starbucks and more brands have introduced drive-through lanes and
automated pickup (in-store) to enable this to happen. Chipotle went one step
further, naming its drive-throughs ‘Chipotlanes’, which proved highly
successful in differentiating the brand.
Physical evidence: legroom, seat width and location of seat in cabin are
considerations for airline travellers. Over the decades airline seats have
occupied less and less space, and if travellers want more room they must
pay to upgrade. Singapore Airlines, known for great customer experience, is
constantly seeking ways to update its planes for all traveller classes. In
economy class, passengers can enjoy roomy seating with additional features,
such as touchscreen entertainment monitors, reading lights, coat hooks and
plenty of space to sit comfortably. This physical evidence enables the airline
to create competitive advantage and be the world’s most awarded airline
(Singapore Airlines 2022).
The marketing mix should be well blended
The third characteristic of an effective marketing mix for all elements–product,
price, promotion and place, people, process and physical evidence–should be
well blended to form a consistent theme (Kotler 2011). If a product or service
gives superior benefits to customers, price, which may send cues to customers
regarding quality, should reflect those extra benefits to offer great value. The
entire promotional mix should be designed with the objective of
communicating a consistent message to the target audience about these
benefits, and distribution decisions should be consistent with the overall
strategic position of the product in the marketplace. The use of exclusive
outlets for upmarket fashion and cosmetics brands (e.g. Armani, Christian
Dior, Calvin Klein) is consistent with their strategic position. Levels of
customer service should be commensurate with the positioning of the brand
and integrated with other chosen elements of a brand’s mix. While a brandstands out with one or two elements of the mix, the rounded offer will include
most of the other elements. Amazon offers the world’s largest range of
products at highly competitive prices, but its competitive advantage is derived
from an ‘integrative business model’ that links together all of the elements of
the extended mix across its business platforms: Amazon Marketplace, Amazon
Fulfilment, Amazon Web Services (Aversa et al. 2021). See Exhibit 7.9 for
Amazon’s physical evidence supporting it business strategy on climate change.

The marketing mix should match corporate
resources
The choice of marketing mix strategy may ultimately be down to the available
financial resources of the company. For example, Amazon was able to
establish its global presence only by massive financial investment in online
advertising. Certain media–for example, TV advertising–require a minimum
threshold investment before they are regarded as feasible. In the UK, a rule of
thumb is that at least £5 million per year is required to achieve impact in a
national advertising campaign. Clearly, those brands that cannot afford such a
promotional budget must use other, less expensive media (e.g. digital
marketing, posters or sales promotion) to attract and hold customers.
A second internal resource constraint may be the internal competences of
the company. A marketing mix strategy may be too ambitious for the limited
marketing skills of personnel to implement effectively. While an objective maypage 286
be to reduce or eliminate this problem in the medium to long term, in the short
term marketing management may have to heed the fact that strategy must take
account of competences.
Each of the elements of the marketing mix is covered in detail in later
chapters, in Parts 2 and 3.
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapterpage 287
 Detailed review
1. The concepts of market segmentation and target marketing, and their use in
developing marketing strategy
Market segmentation is the identification of individuals or organizations with similar
characteristics that have significant implications for the determination of marketing
strategy.
Its use aids target market selection, the ability to design a tailored marketing mix,
the development of differential marketing strategies, and the identification of
opportunities and threats.
Target marketing is the choice of specific segment(s) to serve. It concerns the
decision of where to compete.
Its use is focusing company resources on those segments that it is best able to
serve in terms of company resources and segment attractiveness. Once chosen, a
tailored marketing mix that creates a differential advantage can be designed based
on an in-depth understanding of target customers.
2. The methods of segmenting consumers
Segmentation involves looking at the characteristics of the disaggregated market
and then dividing this market into meaningful segments. Consumer segmentation
can use many different variables as the basis for identifying a market. There are
three broad categories of variables that a marketer might use: behavioural,
psychographic and profile variables.
3. The rise of business ecosystems, online communities and tribal marketing
Tribal marketing offers a new way of thinking about identifying target markets.
Tribal clans are self-selecting, and are formed by mutual interest in a brand,
product or service.
Online communities formed through social media networks can be very powerful,
and may have the capacity to influence the development of a brand and its value.
Tribal markets tend to be more about co-creation of value than traditional
marketing segmentation.
4. The factors that can be used to evaluate market segments
Two broad issues should be used: market attractiveness and the company’s
capability to compete.
Market attractiveness can be assessed by examining market factors (segment
size, segment growth rate, price sensitivity, bargaining power of customers,
bargaining power of suppliers, barriers to market segment entry and barriers to
market segment exit), competitive factors (nature of competition, the likelihood ofpage 288
new entrants and competitive differentiation) and political, social, environmental
and technological factors (political issues, social trends, environmental issues and
technology issues).
Capability to compete can be assessed by analysing exploitable marketing assets,
cost advantages, technological edge, and managerial capabilities and
commitments.
5. The four target market strategies: undifferentiated, differentiated, focused and
customized marketing
Undifferentiated marketing occurs when a company does not segment but applies
a single marketing mix to the whole market.
Differentiated marketing occurs when a company segments the market and
applies separate marketing mixes to appeal to all or some of the segments (target
markets).
Focused marketing occurs when a company segments the market and develops
one specific marketing mix for one segment (target market).
Customized marketing occurs when a company designs a separate marketing mix
for each customer.
6. The concept of positioning and the keys to successful positioning
There are two aspects of positioning: the choice of target market (where to
compete) and the creation of a differential advantage (how to compete).
The objective is to create and maintain a distinctive place in the market for a
company and/or its products.
The four keys to successful positioning are: clarity, consistency, credibility and
competitiveness.
7. Positioning and repositioning strategies
A useful tool for determining the position of a brand in the
marketplace is the perceptual map.
Positioning strategy should be formulated on a clear choice of target market,
based on market segment attractiveness and company capability, and the creation
of a differential advantage (based on an understanding of the attributes–choice
criteria–that consumers use when choosing between brands).
Repositioning strategies can be based on changes to the product and/or target
market. Four strategies are: image repositioning, product repositioning, intangible
repositioning and tangible repositioning.
8. The characteristics of developing an effective marketing mix
Once the strategic work is complete on segmentation, targeting and positioning,
the outputs can inform the tactical actions needed to implement marketing
initiatives. An effective mix:
matches the customer’s needs
creates competitive advantage
is well blended
matches corporate resources.
9. Segmenting B2B marketingpage 289
Segmenting B2B markets is a way of identifying potential customers using
macrosegmentation and microsegmentation techniques.
Macrosegmentation involves reviewing organization size, industry and geography
to identify clusters of similar businesses.
Microsegmentation involves reviewing the choice criteria, structure of the DMU,
the way purchasing is organized, the buy-class and the innovativeness of the
organization.
Key Terms
behavioural segmentation the targeting of consumers via their browsing histories,
search patterns and time frames to connect consumers and their interests; marketers
can use such data to precisely profile potential target customers
benefit segmentation the grouping of people based on the different benefits they seek
from a product
customized marketing the market coverage strategy where a company decides to
target individual customers and develops separate marketing mixes for each
differential marketing strategies market coverage strategies where a company decides
to target several market segments and develops separate marketing mixes for each
focused marketing a market coverage strategy where a company decides to target one
market segment with a single marketing mix
lifestyle segmentation the grouping of people according to their pattern of living as
expressed in their activities, interests and opinions
market segmentation the process of identifying individuals or organizations with similar
characteristics that have significant implications for the determination of marketing
strategy
positioning the choice of target market (where the company wishes to compete) and
differential advantage (how the company wishes to compete)
profile segmentation the grouping of people in terms of profile variables, such as age
and socio-economic group, so that marketers can communicate to them
psychographic segmentation the grouping of people according to their lifestyle and
personality characteristics
repositioning changing the target market or differential advantage, or both
target marketing the choice of which market segment(s) to serve with a tailored
marketing mix
undifferentiated marketing a market coverage strategy where a company decides to
ignore market segment differences and develops a single marketing mix for the whole
marketStudy Questions

CASE 13
UNLEASHING THE POWER
OF NABLABS
Introduction
Around the world, beer consumption patterns have changed as consumers’ needs have
evolved. Growth in conventional beer sales is stalling, as an increasing number of people
become more focused on health and well-being (EUCAM 2018). A growing push among
consumers to live healthier lives has completely refocused the food and drinks industry over the
last few years. Consumers shop differently, cook differently, eat differently and drink differently.
The shift towards health and wellness has shaken up the alcohol sector, and resulted in rising
demand for no-alcohol beers and low-alcohol beers (NABLABs) (Kowitt 2017). No-alcohol
beers are generally considered as those under 0.5 per cent ABV, while low-alcohol beers are
considered as those between 0.5 per cent and 3 per cent ABV. ABV refers to ‘alcohol by
volume’ and is a standard measure of how much alcohol (ethanol) is contained in a given
volume of an alcoholic beverage (expressed as a volume percentage) (Arthur 2016).Source: Monkey Business Images/Shutterstock
A Growing Segment
The global beer market is set to increase by US$88.70 billion between 2020 and 2025,
progressing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.45 per cent during the forecast
period (Technavio 2022). According to Nielsen, NABLAB is a big and fast-growing beer
category, having increased by 147 per cent since 2015–that’s a 30 per cent uplift year on year
(Anonymous 2020). And the future looks bright for NABLABs as it is predicted that the non￾alcohol beer category alone will grow annually by 8.7 per cent between 2021 and 2025 (IBEC
2022). This rate of growth has made the category a major priority for big brewers. The industry
had little choice but to act, as increasing demand for these products is pushing the brewers into
action. Currently, alcohol-free beer accounts for about 2.4 per cent of overall beer consumption,
but despite such a low base it is expected the move towards health will make NABLABs one of
the fastest-growing categories of beers (The Economist 2021). Zero-alcohol and low-alcohol
beers may be a niche market for leading global brands like Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch
InBev, Heineken and Carlsberg, but these big brewers have introduced zero-alcohol and low￾alcohol beer brands to appeal to wider markets. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the biggest of the
brewers, aims to make a fifth of its sales from low-alcohol and no-alcohol beers by 2025,
investing in new products such as Budweiser Zero, the alcohol-free version of its famous brand
(EUCAM 2018). Meanwhile, lots of well-known beer brands, such as Heineken, Carlsberg,page 294
Brew Dog, Peroni, Stella Artois, San Miguel and many more, have recently introduced low￾alcohol and no-alcohol versions of their classic beers (Jeffreys 2022). There is growing
evidence that the industry is taking this category seriously as the first major European trade
event dedicated to no-alcohol and low-alcohol beverages is scheduled to take place in 2023.
The two-day event promoting healthy living and the mindful consumption of alcohol will take
place on 3 and 4 April 2023 at the Taets Art and Event Park in Amsterdam, and it’s expected
most of the big global brewers will be present (Bayley 2022).
According to Global Market Insights, the global non-alcoholic beer market is projected to
surpass US$25 billion by 2024 (Anonymous 2018). Europe represents almost three-quarters of
non-alcoholic beer drunk worldwide, with Spain making up 13 per cent of zero-alcohol sales. In
Japan, where nearly 5 per cent of beer sales contain no alcohol, brewers are launching new
brands and forecasting steep growth. However, the United States is almost virgin territory, with
zero alcohol’s market share just 0.5 per cent, according to Euromonitor (Ahern 2021).
Drivers of Growth
Designated drivers, pregnant women, nursing women and those who abstain from alcohol for
religious reasons are all target groups for the category. These beers are ideal for occasions
when people want a great-tasting beer, but either cannot or do not wish to consume more or
any alcohol. However, experts believe that health-conscious millennials are increasingly driving
demand for NABLABs as they begin to recognize the impact alcohol has on their body and
mental health. Millennials are becoming increasingly health-conscious and are aware of long￾term effects of alcohol, and they are now consuming much less than previous generations.
Gym membership is up among millennials and they don’t want alcohol to undo all their efforts.
More and more millennials are embracing sobriety and may be reacting against the ‘laissez
faire’ attitude shown by the boozier older generation (Donnelly 2018). According to Alcohol
Change UK, the overall amount of alcohol consumed per person in the UK has risen and fallen
repeatedly. Since reaching a peak in the mid-2000s, consumption has been falling steadily,
particularly among young people. Around 20 per cent of the UK population don’t drink alcohol at
all and this figure is increasing among young people in particular (Alcohol Change UK 2022).
The drinks industry is responding to trends and to the growing success of movements like Dry
January (the month-long abstinence campaign launched by Alcohol Concern in 2013). The
growing success of Dry January has also resulted in other networks springing up, such as One
Year No Beer, Go Sober for October and Club Soda (a group that encourages ‘mindful
drinking’), to champion the mindful drinking movement. This has led to spin-off events (such as
the Club Soda Mindful Drinking Festival and the opening of the first alcohol-free off-licence in
London in 2022), and to a rash of recently published books (e.g. Mindful Drinking, The Sober
Diaries and The 28 Day Alcohol-Free Challenge). Mindful drinking, a modern-day temperance
movement, is becoming increasingly fashionable among millennials who are looking to
moderate their alcohol intake, embrace periods of sobriety or even become fully teetotal (Hurst
2017). Some believe that the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated this trend and helped the
movement towards mindful alcohol consumption. It may have accelerated caution when it
comes to drinking, as more consumers are tuned in to their health and wellness goals (Just
Drinks 2021).page 295
As millennials spend more time interacting with friends online rather than in person, they are
increasingly shaping their personal identity around the feedback and the popularity of the
content they share on their social media channels. Young users of social media are extremely
image aware, carefully curating content and sharing purchases that in some way enhance their
personal brands on their channels (Wood and Brennan 2017). Interestingly, some millennials
are choosing to drink NABLABs because of the fear of being documented in an
uncompromising state. There is a concern that with a constant stream of live videos and photos
shared online for all to see, pictures of them drunk will be seen by family, friends and potential
employers. They are very attuned to social media, and very conscious that being seen drunk on
social media does not look good (Van de Sande 2022).
Challenges
As zero-alcohol and low-alcohol beers are relatively new, stimulating market growth has meant
overcoming a number of challenges for leading brewers: negative consumer perceptions of the
beers and their taste; defining a competitive market position for the beers; working out how to
differentiate NABLABs from existing products, and from other competing low-alcohol and no￾alcohol products. Additionally, many smaller craft brewers are introducing new low-alcohol and
alcohol-free beers. There is also the threat of substitution by other non-alcoholic soft drinks,
which continue to be popular and pose a major challenge for NABLABs looking to gain share in
the drinks market. However, recent research has shown that within the NABLAB beer segment,
there are substantial opportunities for new entrants to solidify a place as a major supplier. At the
end of 2019, the top three brands within the segment accounted for a 60 per cent
share, and by the end of 2021 this had grown to only 70 per cent–making this
segment significantly less competitive than other segments within the lower-alcohol space
(Dingwall 2022).
Persuading consumers to try the new beers and choose them on a regular basis has been
challenging as this segment has traditionally suffered from taste and image problems. For
example, the category has been associated with weaker flavours and poor quality. NABLABs
face the challenge of trying to make their beers appealing to both men and women, and moving
away from outdated views. Traditionally, beer companies have mainly focused on males, but a
real opportunity exists to target both genders (Roderick 2017). Yet another challenge facing
brewers of these NABLABs is that there is a perception that these products are a ‘distress
purchase’. Consumers have often felt forced to choose products from this category because
they were the designated driver or were watching their weight, therefore creating an association
with sacrifice or a negative (Huddleston 2022). Finally, the future of the NABLAB segment is still
uncertain. While this segment is experiencing more growth compared to the overall beer sector,
this is coming from a small base. The big question remains: does this category have real
growth potential, or will it never be more than a niche add-on to standard beer?
Questions
1. Suggest what to consider when marketing NABLABs to millennials.
2. Discuss the main challenges facing brewers in the NABLAB segment. What can companies
and brands do to overcome these challenges?page 296
3. Choose any one no-alcohol beer or low-alcohol beer that you are familiar with. Identify the
positioning of this beer, i.e. its target market and differential advantage. How is the beer’s
positioning communicated?
4. NABLABs often suffer from negative public perceptions regarding their image and taste.
Suggest how these beers can be repositioned to make them more appealing to consumers.

CASE 14
BOOTS: MANAGING OWN￾LABEL PRODUCTS AND
THEIR POSITIONING
WITHIN A CHANGING
ENVIRONMENT AND
DYNAMIC MARKET(S)Influencing and Developing the Positioning of
Boots UK
Boots UK has retailed products under the ‘Boots’ brand since the inception of the company
more than 180 years ago. Its founder, Jesse Boot, was purpose driven and brought healthcare
to the masses–which was necessary as the combination of access to doctors and apothecaries
and the cost of remedies put them beyond most people, regardless of need. Jesse was an early
adopter of advertising and, following campaigns that promoted healthcare for a shilling (a small
sum in the pre-decimal British monetary system), the company led the way in providing
affordable medicines that were tested for quality and safety before this was a requirement.
Boots provided advice and support from qualified nurses and pharmacists as part of the
solution it offered. Making its medicines available via mail order during the First World War and
extending its opening hours during the flu epidemic of 1919 helped cement its reputation
further. Along with his wife Florence, Jesse also introduced advances and innovations in
retailing, and Boots extended its product range beyond medicines too. If that was not enough,
Florence and Jesse also advocated improvements in worker education and conditions, and the
five-day working week. These were all groundbreaking actions, underpinned by the company’s
values and implemented by Boots.

Because of Jesse’s own background, and the desire to enhance access to quality healthcare
for everyone, the initial focus for Boots was on medicines, with a clear strategy to target
individuals and families on lower incomes, not least because the needs of such customers were
not catered for by others. Over time, and underpinned by its values and approach, the Boots
name became known as a mark of higher standards and quality. This enabled the business to
evolve, enhance and extend its offer, and to be a recognized as a trusted provider of market￾leading products and services. Product innovations that supported the development of the
Boots brand included the popular painkiller Ibuprofen, the creation of a range of affordable
cosmetics under the name No7, and its work to devise the five-star UVA rating system for
suncare products. More recently, following its history of operating in a socially responsible way,
the company has joined the Plastics Pact (led by WRAP), and made significant progress in
reducing and eliminating plastics, with benefits for its products, packaging and customers.
From early on, and following some of these innovations and developments, the segments the
company served evolved. Not only did it offer great value healthcare, it also offered cutting￾edge products and services. Slightly more affluent shoppers became a focus for Boots, and apage 298
target for its latest products and developments. For example, the beauty part of the business
developed and grew from the early days due to Jesse’s wife, Florence, and the
market opportunities available. Florence was the driving force behind these
products and approached their launch in a way reminiscent of current practices: drawing
inspiration from celebrities of the day and generating appeal via their preferences. This overall
positioning of the brand, with its broad reach across product ranges and added service,
remains today. Boots UK still offers a large range of own-label products in the value tier, but
with added-value benefits, and applies science, knowledge, trend and innovation led products
and solutions, many of which are differentiated via sustainability features and Boots’ social
purpose, which allows the company to stretch into premium beauty, couture fragrances and
other markets.
Walgreens and the Creation of the Alliance and
Master Brand Strategy
Walgreens started small, with a focus on making lower-cost medicines available to a wider
audience. It commenced trading when, in 1901, Charles R. Walgreen Senior bought the
Chicago drugstore he worked in as a pharmacist. Because of his knowledge and training, to
keep quality high and prices low, and rather than buying in bulk to manage costs, Charles
manufactured his own medicines. Similar to the Boots UK story, Walgreens’ history centres on
the importance of making quality healthcare products available to all, extending its product
ranges within healthcare and beyond, to support its reach and growth. Expansion within and
beyond its Chicago base, to further support the availability of its products, was a key strategy
too. For example, by 1926, Walgreens had 100 drugstores, moved into Mexico in 1946 and
Puerto Rico in 1960, opening its 1,000th store in 1984. With further focus on availability, with
likely operational and cost benefits too, Walgreens co-located and shared staff within grocery
stores and then used a freestanding corner drugstore model in the early 2000s. Stores now
have cutting-edge, experience-driven layouts and designs, and the company often uses a
larger store format with a core pharmacy and a range of other products and departments in one
place. To support this work, Walgreens has clearly focused on physical location and store
design. It led the market with the creation of drive-through and self-service pharmacies, has
launched a comprehensive online pharmacy, and more recently has made available a ‘find your
pharmacist’ tool and become the first US retailer to trial on-demand drone deliveries. Walgreens
has addressed wider issues of accessibility through, for example, its use of multilingual labels
on prescription medicine, and through safety in its use of child-resistant containers for
prescription drugs. Both were market firsts.
After many years of separately innovating and growing, the first step in the strategic partnership
between Boots and Walgreens came in 2012 when Walgreens bought a 45 per cent stake in
Alliance Boots. The move brought together two entities with a similar and complimentary focus,
with a view to creating a global health and well-being enterprise that was pharmacy led. In
2014, the strategic partnership was completed and the Walgreens Boots Alliance was formed.
Today, the two businesses are aligned through their master brand purpose of creating more
joyful lives through better health for all.
Beauty and Personal Care: the Current Market
Context and Demand Factorspage 299
While the UK is among the largest and most innovative beauty and personal care (BPC)
markets around the globe (currently worth about £10 billion), it has seen overall decline in value
since 2018 and a plateauing in the size of most markets since that time, with little change
expected for the foreseeable future (Mintel 2022a). Despite previous increases in income and
households’ confidence in their financial positions, the impact of Covid-19, the rising cost of
resources and related costs, and recent economic uncertainties in the UK (Mintel 2022b) are
leading to impacts on preferences, choices and shifts in spending in the BPC market overall
and markets within (Mintel 2022a). A range of factors (as noted in Mintel 2022a, 2022b, 2022c)
have contributed further to market fragmentation and market dynamics, including:
the ongoing impact of hybrid working and working from home, with legacy impacts on
hygiene habits
a continued focus on beauty routines, and a focus on wellness and well-being and potential
developments
shifts in demographics and society–for example, while there is an overall decline in male￾specific skincare, there is growth in interest in male make-up with, for example, around 15
per cent of males under 45 visiting cosmetics counters
an increase in costs of raw materials for products and their packaging, with some specific
impacts from legal controls and taxes/levies adding further challenges for some, has led to
interest in simplicity, materials, refilling, and so on
changes in consumer preferences and habits–for example, a move to
simplicity and a more natural look while, at the same time, customers are also
seeking out ‘bargains’ or bulk buying to take advantage of discounts
ethical/environmental foundations for innovations with customers are often left to determine
their own priorities in this area as developments by organizations span a range of areas
(e.g. ingredients, packaging)
increasing concern about, and control over, green claims and/or the potential for
greenwashing, and its impact(s) on customer interest, attitudes and purchase behaviour.
Overall, the decline of the beauty category (cosmetics and face, body and foot care) has been
less pronounced than that of personal care (haircare, oral hygiene, soaps, shaving and
deodorants). To counter this overall downward trend, both BPC categories have evidenced
growth in some markets or segments. For example (Mintel 2022a, 2022c):
renewed interest in colour cosmetics and fragrances post-pandemic specifically
value/budget and own brands and products remain of interest (an opportunity and also a
challenge for Boots UK); with this however comes clear attention to the search for value,
with some impacts for loyalty
specialist producers (who often focus on retail experience to underpin and support their
offer) are, overall, on the up, and their approach and ethos can challenge larger-scale and
existing players like Boots UK, despite their brand recognition and positioning
online retailers and direct to customer (D2C) businesses (who regularly maximize the use of
technologies) are of ever-increasing relevance, with the pandemic a specific time of change
and influence for many; there is no doubt online will remain a key factor and influence in the
BPC market dynamic and demand factors moving forward
specific concerns connected to, for example, environmental and ethical issues–with links
here to wider habits and a more ‘natural’ look; this also includes preference for natural
ingredients and a willingness for some groups, such as younger customers, to pay more for
more sustainable and/or ethical BPC products.
In the own-label space, Boots UK is a major player, benefiting from customer trust and
perceptions of its differentiation from others in its markets (Mintel 2022a). This is due to the
range of products and services offered (including Covid vaccinations), how these are made
available (with some online gains during the pandemic), its approach to recognizing andpage 300
rewarding loyalty, and the role of the company’s values in the quality of products and services
offered (including sustainability-related developments and innovations). However, given the
market dynamics and demand factors, Boots UK faces significant challenges, alongside other
‘big player’ specialists like Superdrug, in maintaining and gaining market share. This is due to
the growth of other (and new) own-label products and brands, which now include many fashion
retailers, Amazon, grocery retailers (including Tesco and Sainsbury’s) and also discounters
such as Aldi and Lidl.
In this context, the challenge Boots UK faces is no longer simply about bringing lower-cost
alternatives to national brands. It is about creating products to help build the brand positioning
while, at the same time, recognizing and also seeking to drive industry and market changes.
The latter is important for all sectors but specifically for health and beauty. Boots UK is aiming
to position itself as a brand fit for the future, with clear values and a purpose-driven strategy
that is grounded in an environmental, social, ethical and governance/assurance agenda. The
intention is to attract Gen Z shoppers to its ranges, at a price point that stays true to its heritage
(and loyal, older customer base, who know and love Boots UK), which means it competes with
others on the high street but supported and supplemented by its online offer. The new brand
positioning of ‘Boots, with you, for life’ is how this is expressed to customers.
Current Boots UK Responses and What the
Future May Bring
To counter the challenges it faces, and similar to Walgreens, Boots UK has focused efforts on
its approach to supporting and enhancing the experience of its customers, including the design
and creation of a more appealing and interactive in-store retail environment. This underpins and
potentially enhances existing customer service elements but also recognizes the role of
experiences in relationships and trust, and how this supports the differentiation of Boots UK and
its positioning.
At a product level, Boots UK continues to work hard to innovate and design new products and
redesign its current products and their packaging. Much of this work pre-dates more recent
changes and developments in legislation and regulation, and is grounded by the purpose and
values of Boots UK. Examples include the introduction of the first own-label biodegradable baby
wipe option in the UK, and the removal of plastics from tissue boxes and metallic board from its
dental range, plus a range of other developments. While doing this, Boots UK not
only responded to ongoing market and customer requirements, but also grounded
its approach in its social responsibility and commitment to the Plastics Pact. The move to
biodegradable baby wipes also saved about 200 million tonnes of plastic per year; changes to
packaging make items easier for customers to recycle too (WBA 2021).
In the present dynamic marketplace, Boots UK recognizes that customers are more informed
than ever and, despite the company’s focus on quality and loyalty, and its many successes,
products and changes have not always achieved the outcomes intended. For example, when
reducing the carbon footprint associated with transportation, the ‘flat packing’ of wash bags
meant their actual size could not be easily assessed and visually they appeared creased. They
were, as a result, less appealing to customers.
In addition to the risks associated with new product development and launch, and while well
intentioned, some developments/improvements miss the mark. For example, Boots UK recently
sought to launch a range of value bath and body products that focused on mindfulness to a
newer, younger customer segment. In this instance, and unfortunately, the packaging
specification was too low and the products so cheap they lacked credibility in a space that isconsidered by customers to be more ‘premium’. The product launch suffered challenges too.
The combination of low product desirability and poor execution meant the products lacked
effective positioning and appeal with the target market. This was compounded by a lack of buzz
around the range, meaning there was little positive peer-to-peer discussion about it, which may
have helped to overcome some of the problems faced.
Of further potential challenge, and a specific concern for a scale operator like Boots UK in its
market, is the ongoing and growing threat from smaller niche-market (often D2C) companies.
The approach of these organizations is often underpinned by:
the rise of the Instagram selling model and the role of influencers; see for example the
impact and influence of brands such as BYBI, with post-influencer platforms such as
MyBeautyBrand now taking things a step further to offer peer-to-peer recommendations and
active collaboration too
the potential to tap in to the wider trend for consumers wanting to appear savvy and ‘in the
know’, or wanting to challenge the ‘mainstream’
a razor-sharp focus on the requirements and areas of interest of their customers (and
founders); in doing this, these brands often present an authentic narrative underpinned by
clear values–for example, brands such as Axiology and Five Dot Botanics seek to deliver
better products (and solutions to customer problems), not least because their founders
could not find the products they sought based on their own sustainability and ethical
principles.
While the benefit of perceptions related to differentiation and trust in Boots UK are evident at a
point in time, they can shift quite rapidly within the BPC market as a result of the market
dynamics, trends and factors already identified. The approach of smaller, niche organizations,
and how they create and deliver value, also challenges. This is particularly relevant for Boots
UK when it seeks to attract and develop new customers in newer segments. In this sense, for
example, if existing or new customers prioritize, or see priority in, specific specialist products
and provision, rather than the breadth and range of products offered, this is likely to be
problematic for Boots UK. Not least because many niche producers operate a D2C model that
reflects the overall interest in, and move to, online by younger customers, and other customers
too. The value offered connects with exclusivity (which supports differentiation and appeal),
direct reassurance from owners and influencers (and enhanced levels of trust), convenience
(with benefits for those with busy lives and/or other priorities, and influences on decisions and
choices), and so on.
In this space, larger brands are potentially also at a disadvantage when it comes to production
and product launches that are linked to ‘calendars’ and peak sales periods. This approach is
considerably different to, for example, the unpredictable ‘drops’ of niche and off-the-radar
brands, which can drive a cult following and, in turn, create demand. Take, for example, The
INKEY List, which having launched in September 2018 was already selling a product every 30
seconds in the UK by February 2019, with multiple new products launched to market each
month from that time (many of which are a direct response to customer demand and feedback).
This approach has specific appeal for those who are active beauty shoppers, who seek out the
‘new’, and are not tied or interested in the, potentially, slower product and service development
processes of larger and well-known brands. The risk of new product launches that have not
been effectively tested, and associated impacts on brand/reputation, is also a factor for Boots
UK.
Within the BPC market overall, there are clear benefits for businesses and brands that focus on
lower volumes, and the agility and responsiveness that comes within being a niche operator;
these organizations may appear more ‘fashionable’ and feel like they are ‘better’ plugged in to
customer requirements–for example, as a result of the challenge they bring to the ‘norm’, the
creativity in how they create buzz around their products and what they do, and so on, all ofwhich can appeal to criteria beyond just issues of quality and product performance. page 301
However, it is important for a larger player like Boots UK to also develop and
pursue an appropriate brand and position strategy. In doing so, Boots UK is seeking to build on
its heritage and current brand positioning. It is focusing on driving loyalty through differentiation
and trust, and delivering customer value through quality products, services and experiences at
a mass scale. But, this is not easy. The demands of customers are ever increasing, and
customers are actively seeking ‘great’ value for money while also requiring more sustainable
features and benefits in their assessment of product efficacy. Not only this, every beauty
business is trying to create the next big, cult beauty product that resonates and stands the test
of time for customers who love buying beauty. These customers not only shop for what’s new
but they also readily consume and move with the trends too. It is these customers, who are
highly engaged with both specific and a wider range of BPC products, who are the type of
shopper that Boots UK wants to attract and develop longer-term relationships with. While a
challenge, this may be achieved with a focus on the bedrock of differentiation and trust,
grounded by the breadth of Boots UK’s products, brands and own-brand ranges, and the
provision of all the daily essentials that these customers need and know they can trust from
Boots UK. In doing so, Boots UK recognizes these customers are likely to supplement these
purchases with a portfolio of other products and shopping experiences. Boots UK recognizes
that in meeting the needs of new customers, and nurturing new relationships, it must also
maintain its relationships with its current and loyal customer base.
There is no doubting that the challenges within the BPC market will continue, as will the threat
from other own-label brands. Like others in this market, Boots UK must, therefore, continue to
monitor, recognize and respond to changes in customer requirements–the pace and nature of
change making this job that much harder for all and creating opportunities for many.
Questions
1. What approaches to segmentation and targeting best explain the Boots UK strategy at the
start of its journey, at points in time and over time?
2. Is the history and story of the Boots UK brand, its values and purpose, and well-known
product brands and services, of benefit and importance or a challenge when it comes to the
markets it targets and its positioning?
3. What role do the purpose, values and sustainability oriented developments and innovations
that Boots UK has engaged in play in its positioning and response to the requirements of
selected segments?
4. What are the benefits and disadvantages for smaller niche producers, who appear more
likely to be plugged in to the (new) product requirements of customers than larger
organizations such as Boots UK, when it comes to their segmentation strategy?

arketing success goes beyond merely satisfying customer needs. Brand
manufacturers must consider ways to focus market opportunities, using
their customers’ values. In this chapter we focus on value creation from
the perspective of brands.
The core element in the marketing mix is the firm’s product because this
provides the functional requirements sought by customers. Marketingmanagers develop their products into brands that help to create unique market
positions (see Chapter 7) in the minds of customers. Brand superiority leads to
high sales, the ability to charge price premiums and the power to resist
distributor power. Firms attempt to retain their current customers through
brand loyalty. Loyal customers are typically less price sensitive, and the
presence of a loyal customer base provides the firm with valuable time to
respond to competitive actions (DeKimpe et al. 1997). The management of
products and brands is therefore a key factor in marketing success.
This chapter will explore the nature and importance of branding, how
successful brands are built and how brand equity is created. We also explore a
series of key branding strategy decisions: brand name strategies and choices,
rebranding, brand extension and stretching, and co-branding. Finally, we
explore global and pan-European branding.
Products and Brands
A product is anything capable of satisfying customer needs. For example, a
Belvita breakfast biscuit, Nike trainers, a Nissan Leaf EV or a haircut by Toni
& Guy are all capable of satisfying different needs from hunger, through
clothing and transportation to self-image. However, we often distinguish
between products and services, with products being tangible (e.g. a can of
Heinz soup) and services being mainly intangible (e.g. a manicure).
Consequently, it is logical to include services within the definition of the
product but to be aware there are differences. Hence, there are physical
products (goods) such as a watch, a car or a wind turbine, and service products
such as insurance or financial products like a mortgage, pension or personal
loan.
Products satisfy customer needs. For example, a hamburger satisfies
hunger, a wind turbine provides sustainable power and insurance products
reduce financial risk. The principles discussed in this chapter apply equally to
physical and service products. However, there are special considerations
associated with service products (e.g. intangibility), and as service industries
(e.g. restaurants, tourism, banking, the public sector) are an important and
growing sector in most developed countries, Chapter 11 is dedicated to
examining service products and services marketing in detail.page 307
Branding is the process by which companies distinguish their product
offerings from the competition. By developing a distinctive name, packaging
and design, a brand is created. Most brands are supported by logos – for
example, the Nike ‘swoosh’ and the prancing horse of Ferrari. By developing
an individual identity, branding permits customers to develop associations with
the brand (e.g. prestige, style, low cost) and eases the purchase decision (De
Chernatony 1991). The marketing task is to ensure positive associations
between the chosen positioning objectives (see Chapter 7), the product and the
brand.
Branding affects perceptions. In blind product testing, consumers often fail
to distinguish between brands in each product category and often cannot
correctly identify what they perceive to be their favourite brand. For example,
the Pepsi Challenge used a series of taste tests and blind tests (i.e. the brand
identities were concealed) to determine the preferred brand of cola. The results
showed that, while more people bought Coca-Cola, when blindfolded they
preferred the taste of Pepsi. Advances in neuroscience may go some way to
explaining the results. A recreation of the test during which participants were
wired to a brain scanner produced identical results, although during tasting
those who were blindfolded exhibited a flurry of activity in the part of the
brain stimulated by taste, while in those told which brand they were drinking
the part of the brain associated with higher thinking was activated (Valantine
2009).
The word ‘brand’ is derived from the Old Norse word ‘brandr’, which
means ‘to burn’, as when livestock owners marked their animals to identify
ownership (Keller 2008). This definition remains pertinent today, as modern
branding aims to permanently capture a part of the buyer’s mind (Hegarty
2011), with the aim that they will always choose a particular brand.
The Product Line and Product Mix
Brands are not often developed in isolation but normally fall within a firm’s
product line and mix. A product line is a group of brands closely related in
terms of their functions and the benefits they provide. For example, Unilever’sbeauty brand Dove has washing and bathing product lines, as well as skincare,
haircare and deodorants, and each line includes a range of products. The Dove
promise to its customers is that its products are safe, smell good, are kind to
the body and skin (Dove 2022), and empower women to feel beautiful every
day. The depth of the product line depends on customer requirements, the
products offered by competitors and the firm’s resources (a small firm may
focus on a narrow product line serving only subsegments of the market as this
makes the products commercially viable). Maggi is a global cooking aid brand,
owned by Nestlé, which sells the following product lines: flavourings and
seasonings, snacks, sauces and noodles (which includes pasta and rice). The
brand’s noodle, pasta and rice product line caters for different customer tastes
and lifestyles: 2-Minute noodles are for those in a hurry; On-The-Go are
‘cuppa’ noodles for eating anywhere; Special Masala noodles, and Upma and
Poha express pouches, are for those seeking authentic tastes and aromatic
flavours (see Exhibit 8.1).

A product mix is the total set of brands marketed by a firm: the sum of the
product lines offered. Thus, the width of the product mix can be gauged by the
number of product lines an organization offers. Royal Philips of the
Netherlands has a diversified product mix offer, from healthcare ranges for
business markets to consumer electronics and lighting. But the firm has a
consistent brand message for this diverse range of products, which is ‘improvepeople’s health and well-being through meaningful innovation.’ (Philips 2022).
Other firms have a much narrower product mix, even comprising just one
product line – such as Tesla, which produces premium-priced electronic
vehicles in only four models (Model S, X, Y and 3), although customers can
make individual choices with regards to features and the colour of their
vehicle.
The management of brand portfolios (the product mix) and product lines is
a key element of the marketing mix product strategy. In this chapter we first
examine the major decisions involved in managing brands – the type of brand
(manufacturer versus own-label) – before looking at how to create value
through brands and how to build brands, name selection strategies, brand
extension and stretching, and the brand acquisition decision. Finally, we
discuss global and pan-European branding.
Brand Types
The two alternatives regarding brand type are manufacturer and own-label
brands. Manufacturer brands are created by producers and bear their own
chosen brand name. The responsibility for marketing the brand lies in the
hands of the producer, for example Windows operating system by Microsoft,
Luna Rossa Ocean cologne by Prada, Sensodyne toothpaste by GSK. The
creation of value for the brand also lies with the producer, and by building
major brands producers can gain distribution and customer loyalty.
A fundamental distinction needs to be made between category, brands and
variants (see Figure 8.1). A category (or product field) is divided into brands,
which in turn may be divided into variants based on flavour, formulation or
another feature (East 1997). For example, Heinz Tomato Soup is the tomato
variant of the Heinz brand of the category ‘soup’. In recent years, several
products have emerged that have become category-creating products, for
example Yakult probiotic drinks, Spanx body-shaping underwear and Twitter
(Carter 2011).
FIGURE 8.1
Category, brands and variantspage 308
Own-label brands (sometimes called private-label or distributor brands)
are created and owned by distributors. Own-label branding, if associated with
tight quality control of suppliers, can provide consistent high
value for customers and be a source of retail power as suppliers
vie to fill excess production capacity by manufacturing products for own-label
branding. Own-label food lines are where supermarkets often do battle. The
power of low-price supermarket own-label brands has focused many producers
of manufacturer brands to introduce so-called fighter brands (i.e. their own
low-price alternatives).
Fighter brands are new alternatives developed as part of a competitive
strategy to protect market share from predatory competitors, and in some cases
to win back customers who have switched to lower-priced alternatives (Ritson
2009). Also called ‘flanker brands’, the new brand is launched by the
established brand. International hotelier Accor, for example, consolidated its
economy hotel brands under the Ibis brand name and introduced a new
fighter/flanker brand, Ibis Budget, which was created by refreshing the
existing Etap budget brand.
There are potential challenges for marketers to consider when establishing
this type of brand: cannibalization of the market as customers switch from a
brand’s premium offer to its fighter brand, financial losses, erosion of value in
the market, competition from new market entrants.
A major decision for producers is whether to agree to supply own-label
products for distributors. The danger is, should customers find out, they may
believe there is no difference between the manufacturer’s brand and the own-page 309
label equivalent. Some companies, such as Kellogg’s, refuse to supply own￾label products; indeed, this global food manufacturer has developed secret
recipes for its Special K brand, to fight against the rise of supermarket own
brands (Reynolds 2015). For other producers, supplying own-label goods is a
means of generating income from the high sales volumes contracted with
distributors. Bokomo Foods is a leading cereal maker and produces branded
own-label foods for the UK and Scandinavia. For example, it produces cereals
for Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Morrisons in the UK, and makes Belso exclusively
for Danish stores Netto, Fotex and Bilka (Bokomo Foods Ltd 2015).
Why Strong Brands are Important
Apple, Google, Microsoft, IBM, China Mobile and General Electric are world￾leading brands, the best of which are valued at more than $2 trillion, and each
year they increase their value (Interbrand 2021). Customers are prepared to
pay for the assurances offered when buying a known brand. Interbrand, a
world-leading brand consultancy, developed a methodology for measuring
brand valuations and trust is a key factor when measuring brand strength.
Global sports brand Nike’s marketing campaigns have positioned the firm as in
favour of equality, fairness and sustainability as a way to gain the trust and
commitment of its customers and other stakeholders. According to Enrique
Arribas, head of brand and corporate marketing at Santander Group, ‘There is
a basic ingredient in building trust: credibility.’ This varies in terms of how it is
demonstrated – for example, H&M has committed to include circular economy
principles in its business model, Apple protects customer privacy, and
Santander, leading on green financing, focuses on sustainability (Brujo 2021).
Strong brands, typically product category leaders, are important to both
firms and consumers. Firms benefit because strong brands add value,
positively affect consumer perceptions of brands, act as a barrier to
competition, improve profits and provide a base for brand extension. Strong
brand names also have positive effects on consumer perceptions and
preferences. Read Mini Case 8.1 to discover how Douwe Egberts is more thanjust coffee to its consumers. Consumers gain because strong brands act as a
form of quality certification and create trust. We look at these factors next.
MINI CASE 8.1
Douwe Egberts: No Ordinary Coffee
Egbert Douwes opened his first coffee shop in Joure, Netherlands, in 1753 with his wife
Akke. Together they laid the foundations for what was to become a powerful global mega￾brand. Their mission was simple: to sell products that could deliver ‘the pleasure of daily
living’. As a result, the coffee they produced was very popular and the business continued to
grow. The brand’s strength was built around the taste and functionality of the coffee.
Source: Dutchmen Photography/Shutterstock
The firm was always keen to adapt to the changing needs of its coffee-drinking customers.
For example, in 1954, Douwe Egberts instant coffee was introduced and, later, instant
cappuccino. Then Douwe Egberts started to notice changes in coffee-drinking habits; it
found brewed coffee needed to provide customers with a more personalized, individual and
luxury feel. So it worked with Dutch technology firm Philips to produce a coffee machine that
could be used with their coffee to make an espresso-like foamy coffee in an instant. In 2001,
the launch of the Senseo was a revolution in coffee drinking and provided a way for
individual customers to have freshly brewed coffee. The Senseo received a positive reaction
and was bought by millions of customers around the world.
Despite being a major player in the global coffee market, in 2010 Douwe Egberts was in
danger of falling behind its competitors. As a result, it set about refreshing its identity,
drawing on the heritage of the brand, and using its 250 years of history and craftsmanship
to reinforce the brand’s position and be perceived positively by its customers. This action
significantly boosted the brand’s popularity and sales, enabling further growth. Recently, the
firm joined forces with Mondelèz International in a mega-merger, bringing it together with
the US group’s Carte Noire, Kenco and Tassimo brands. This move meant the newly named
Jacobs Douwe Egberts held a market-leading position in many countries.page 310
Despite the size of this powerful global brand, it constantly aims to be in touch with its
customers and to respond to the ever-changing market environment. In 2014, it partnered
with Prostate Cancer, a charity promoting awareness of men’s health issues, encouraging
customers to drink a cup of its coffee and post a selfie on Facebook showing foamy
moustaches, to raise the profile of the global Movember fundraising campaign. In 2015,
Douwe Egberts joined forces with Actimel yoghurt, Bonne Maman preserves, HP Sauce,
Nestlé cereal and other leading brands in the ‘A Better Breakfast’ campaign, designed to
encourage the population of the UK not to skip breakfast because it is a very important
meal. In 2020, it launched an ad campaign, ‘Something to Share’, which focused on LGBTQ
communities and sharing with family – over a cup of coffee – conversations about individual
sexuality.
Since opening a single store in the Netherlands, Douwe Egberts has built its reputation and
its business around being first in the minds of its customers when they think about drinking
coffee.
Questions:
1. Explain how Douwe Egberts has extended its brand and how this has enabled the
brand to reach more customers.
2. Discuss the extent to which this firm has built customer-based brand equity for its
brand.
3. From a branding perspective, suggest why Douwe Egberts developed the
‘Something to Share’ ad campaign.

Strong branding enhances firm value, and brand makeovers can seriously
affect valuations. When Burger King changed its menus and introduced fresh
ingredients it got a rebrand, with a retro-style logo, a refreshed brand identity,
even new staff uniforms, in a design focused on the fast-food chain’s heritage.
The slogan also changed to ‘Be Your Way’, to be more in sync with
millennials’ attitudes. The impact of the change was an uplift in customer
sentiment towards the brand, billions of impressions online and its share price
rose by a whopping 7.8 per cent (Bous 2021). Disneyland Paris also got a
makeover, for its 30th birthday. The new branding aims to evoke emotional
ties with the past and strengthen connections with returning visitors, who can
enjoy new displays, costumes and shows (see Exhibits 8.2 and 8.3).EXHIBIT 8.2

Brand value
The financial value of companies can be greatly enhanced by the possession of
strong brands. For example, Nestlé paid £2.5 billion for Rowntree, a UK
confectionery manufacturer, a sum six times its balance sheet value. Nestlé
was not so much interested in Rowntree’s manufacturing base as its brands –
such as KitKat, Quality Street, After Eight and Fruit Pastilles – which were
major brands with brand-building potential.
Apple and Amazon vie for top spot in terms of global brand value. Both
are very successful, with each valued at more than $3 trillion (Brand Finance
2022). In emerging markets, TikTok is named the fastest-growing brand, with
its instant entertainment app that tripled in value in just over a year. Benefitingpage 311
from changes in how we consume media – as streaming services continue to
grow in popularity – and Covid-19 restrictions such as stay-at-home orders, the
app spread rapidly across the globe. WeChat is another strong brand, which has
become a part of everyday life in China (Pash 2022).
Brands can also lose market share for various reasons. For example, when
the UK introduced restrictions on promoting and advertising high-fat and high￾sugar products on TV before 9 p.m., soft drinks manufacturer Britvic and US
cereal manufacturer Kellogg’s were faced with either reformulating their
products into healthier options, changing their advertising schedules and
channels, or introducing new low-fat and low-sugar alternatives. Whichever
option is chosen, there are significant costs involved, and brands potentially
pay a heavy price in sales and valuation (Morrison 2021).
There is also the possibility of unknown consequences of brand exposure.
For example, Kärcher sells cleaning devices in both domestic and commercial
markets, but the functional benefits of the firm’s powerful pressure washer
have seen it mentioned in France’s political arena, suggesting the machine
could be used to clean the streets of undesirable elements: Nicolas Sarkozy in
Paris, and more recently presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse, used the
analogy that a Kärcher could be used to clean the streets of Marseille. Kärcher
responded, seeking to manage the brand’s exposure and connection to more
extreme political views, but perhaps it should rejoice instead, as ‘the Kärcher’
has gained the status of heading up a category in much the same way as
Hoover does with vacuum cleaners, Durex with condoms, Kleenex with tissues
and Zoom with videoconferencing. However, in the longer term, it is unclear
whether this will add to the value of the Kärcher brand (Ritson 2022).
Barrier to competition
The impact of the strong, positive perceptions held by customers with regard
to top brands makes it difficult for new brands to compete. This is one of the
reasons Virgin Coke failed to dent Coca-Cola’s domination of the cola market.
The reputation of strong brands may be a powerful barrier to competition.
However, in technology markets the top spot is not so assured. The
value and market share of digital brands means they face intense
competition.
Digital brands can grow quickly, as they spread like infectious diseases
across the internet, but they can also fall out of favour in the same manner, as
for example did MySpace, Friends Reunited and Second Life (Cannarella andSpechler 2014). Even Facebook, the world’s largest social network, has lost
core customers: millions of teenagers in the UK and US stopped using the
platform because ‘as soon as parents got in they killed it’, and it became
perceived as boring by its core target segment. Founder Mark Zuckerberg
faced further challenges for the brand as the algorithm that links families and
friends and other mechanisms on the platform has been found to be exploiting
behavioural traits for profit, while a proliferation of fake news has also
impacted badly on the brand (Sweeny and De Liz 2018). Zuckerberg tackled
this erosion of the credibility of the brand by rebranding the name of its parent
firm as Meta and focusing on the future. The ‘metaverse’, a parallel digital
world, is to be built using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR),
virtual reality (VR) and other technologies yet to be invented. Facebook,
Instagram and WhatsApp will eventually become more immersed into this
digital universe. Meta is positioned as a brand for the future, with infinite
possibilities (Paul 2021) (see Exhibit 8.4). This does not completely protect it
from competitors, however, so to defend market share from emergent brand
TikTok, Meta has decided to become more like that entertainment app,
promoting short videos as a main form of advertising on its platforms,
Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, which, collectively, have a user base that
covers 75 per cent of internet users globally (excepting China) (Financial
Times 2022).

High profitspage 312
Strong, market-leading brands are rarely the cheapest. Brands such as Heinz,
Kellogg’s, Mercedes, Rolls-Royce, Louis Vuitton, Michelin, L’Oréal and
Microsoft are all associated with premium prices. This is because their
superior brand equity means consumers receive added value over their less
powerful rivals. Strong brands also achieve distribution more readily, gain
economies of scale and are in a better position to resist retailer demands for
price discounts. These forces feed through to profitability. Digital brands are
disrupting this model. Google, Facebook and Twitter are massive global
brands that give away their core product for free. However, adopters have a
price to pay: lack of privacy. Google uses the personal data it collects from our
search behaviour and voice interactions to create its products. It generates
billions of dollars of revenue through targeted advertising and has plans to
expand the use of visual information from your camera to tell you everything
about the objects you can see in your personal space (Tiku 2018).
Base for brand extensions
A strong brand provides the foundation for leveraging positive perceptions and
goodwill from the core brand to brand extensions. Examples include Diet
Coke, Dove Visible Care body wash, Baileys Chocolat Luxe and H&M
Modern Essentials. The new brand benefits from the added value the brand
equity of the core brand bestows on the extension. There is a full discussion of
brand extensions later in this chapter.
Quality certification
Strong brands also benefit customer in that they provide quality certification,
which can aid decision-making. The following example illustrates the lengths
consumers will go to when using strong brands as a form of quality
certification.
Hyundai cars were not noted for their quality. Chung Ju-yung, founder of
the car firm in South Korea, used to count clapped-out deserted cars as a
measure of his brand’s performance. So long as there were more Hyundais
abandoned on the roadside than his competitors’ cars, he was convinced the
firm was doing well. Things are different now: the launch of the Genesis Prada
by Hyundai helped the brand change. Hyundai joined with Italian
designer fashion house Prada to produce an exclusive, high￾quality version of its Genesis range. Buyers in the Gulf and China are the maintarget audience. This model has become a clear indication and informal
certification of Hyundai quality. The Genesis was so successful it has become
a separate division of luxury vehicles, which are now sold globally.
Online too, establishing brand credibility and trust is very important.
VeriSign produces formal certification that offers guarantees for online brands
to indicate the security of an e-commerce website. In the case of Hyundai,
Genesis is acting as an intangible form of quality certification, whereas
VeriSign certificates are highly tangible.
Trust, attachment and loyalty
Consumers tend to trust strong brands and, ultimately, the belief a brand will
deliver on its promises is a deal-clincher when all else is equal. Price is still a
strong discriminating factor in the insurance market, but motorists are looking
for something extra. For example, Aviva, Admiral and Churchill offer motor
insurance in this highly competitive consumer market and each of these brands
has been highly rated by drivers for its customer service (Consumer
Intelligence 2021). Attention to customer needs, especially during the
pandemic, has helped these brands build trust and customer loyalty.
Trust is important in maintaining relationships between customers and
suppliers, and if sustained can engender commitment and long-term
relationships (Rampl et al. 2012). Trust can be transferable too: Konuk (2021)
found customers of retail store brands are prepared to perceive own-label
products positively if they are made aware of the benefits on offer.
Encouraging customers to buy own-label products was also found to increase
loyalty.
Attachment and loyalty require firms to create strong bonds with their
customers, to build mutually beneficial relationships (Keller 2020). To do this,
firms need to understand contextual and situational influences, and how
customers think, feel and act in different circumstances (Huang et al. 2018).
When consumers stop trusting and believing in a brand, the fallout can be
catastrophic. For example, Gerald Ratner destroyed his chain of high-street
jewellery stores when he repeatedly talked about the poor quality of the
merchandise at public speaking engagements; Sunny Delight, Procter &
Gamble’s highly successful children’s fruit drink, fell from grace instantly
once it was revealed drinking too much could turn children yellow; when
Coca-Cola launched its Dasani bottled water in the UK, all went well untilconsumers were made aware it was actually bottled tap water. In each of these
examples, consumers lost trust in the brands because they felt they had been
cheated and, while the brands made every attempt to recover, consumers were
not willing to forget.
Brand Equity
Strong brands are rich in a property called brand equity. Brand equity is a
measure of the strength of a brand in the marketplace by adding tangible value
to a firm through the resulting sales and profits. There are two types of brand
equity: customer-based and proprietary-based brand. Customer-based brand
equity resides in the minds of consumers and consists of brand awareness and
brand image. Proprietary-based brand equity is based on assets attributable to
the firm, and consists of patents and channel relationships.
Customer-based brand equity
The type of brand equity that resides in the minds of consumers who hold
more favourable perceptions and associations towards the brand than towards
its rivals is called customer-based brand equity; this is defined as the
differential effect that brand knowledge has on consumer response to the
marketing of a brand (Keller 2008), such as when consumers react more
favourably to a branded product over one of its rivals. Positive, customer￾based brand equity is likely to result in high customer loyalty, low price
sensitivity, a high willingness for customers to visit more than one outlet to
purchase the brand and a strong base for brand extensions.
There are two sources of customer-based brand equity: brand awareness
and brand image (see Figure 8.2).
FIGURE 8.2
Sources of brand equitypage 313
Brand awareness
Brand awareness is related to brand equity in two ways. First, by raising brand
awareness, the likelihood of the brand entering a consumer’s evoked set (those
brands a consumer seriously considers before making a purchase) is
increased since awareness is a precondition of evaluation of a brand.
Second, in low-involvement situations (discussed in Chapter 4), a purchase
may follow awareness of a brand with little information processing since the
purchase is of low importance or low price. In both cases, increasing brand
awareness can lead to higher sales and profits, and hence increased brand
equity. The global brand awareness of brands like Coca-Cola, Philips, Google,
Facebook, Apple, Samsung and IKEA is a major contributor to their brand
equity.
Brand image
Brand equity can also be increased by creation of a strong brand image. A
positive brand image is formed by generating strong, favourable and unique
associations to the brand in the memory (Keller 2008). A brand image is
created using all elements of the marketing mix: the brand image of a car may
be influenced by product quality (associating it with perceptions of comfort,
reliability, durability and so on), promotion (a marketing communications
campaign may infuse the car with high-status connotations), price (a
competitive price may confer associations with value for money) and place (a
smart, modern dealership may associate the car with efficient after-sales
service). Advertising is often employed to create a brand image. A positive
brand image increases the likelihood of purchase and hence brand equity.page 314
Brands like PayPal, Microsoft, Nestlé, Mastercard, Adidas, Samsung and
Colgate-Palmolive gain equity through their image as being trustworthy
(Morning Consult 2022).
The long-term future of a brand relies on understanding (and measuring)
the mindset of its customers. Many academics suggest brand equity is built in
the minds of the consumer, and is then converted into market performance and
revenue, but measuring performance is a problem and tends to look at short￾term outcomes (Aneslmsson and Bondesson 2015). Brand performance
metrics focus on the basics of brand equity and lean towards tangible
economic values shown in the brand value chain (see Figure 8.3).
FIGURE 8.3
Brand performance metrics
Based on: Keller and Lehman (2006)
Research suggests there are gains from linking economic metrics with
market performance and customer mindset measurement:
Marketing programme actions typically involve the actions taken by brands
to raise awareness and get into the minds of potential customers.
Customer mindset includes any association that links the brand to the
customer’s memory, for example emotions, feelings, experiences, images,
perceptions, beliefs and attitudes (Keller and Lehmann 2003).
Market/brand performance refers to how customers respond to a brand.
Measures include market share, sales, sales growth, market size and share of
wallet. Aneslmsson and Bondesson (2015) suggest the best predictors of
long-term sustainable performance are measures of purchase intention and
attitudinal loyalty because they reflect choice and intended future behaviour.
Financial impact refers to shareholder value and can be measured by stock
price and market capitalization.Proprietary-based brand equity
Proprietary-based brand equity is derived from a firm’s attributes that
deliver value to the brand. These can be found in many aspects of corporate
activity, but the two main sources are patents and channel relationships (see
Figure 8.2).
Patents
A common method to calculate the value of a brand is by considering future
profits and discounting them to the present day. Patents give greater certainty
to future revenue streams by protecting a brand from competitive threat over
the lifetime of the patent. Brand equity, therefore, falls towards the end of this
period. For example, the value of pharmaceutical brands falls as their patents
expire, because of the likely launch of low-priced generic competitors. For
example, Advair, a leading asthma treatment, and Lyrica, a muscle pain relief
drug, are among those about to fall off the patent cliff, meaning – with this loss
of exclusivity – parent companies GSK and Pfizer are set to lose billions of
dollars of revenue (Parrish 2018; Sagonowsky 2019). However, respiratory
medication innovations and the Shingrix vaccine helped GSK withstand a 61
per cent drop in sales when Mylan launched Wixela Inhub, an Advair generic
copycat drug (Lui 2019).
Channel relationships
Experience, knowledge, and close relationships with distributors and suppliers
can enhance the value of firm brands. For example, Procter & Gamble has a
global distribution network across 180 countries facilitating the movement of
fast-moving consumer brands (e.g. Gillette, Oral-B, Pampers), which enhances
the value of these brands.
Brand valuation is a difficult task. It is the process of estimating the
financial value of an individual or corporate brand. A widely cited list of the
top 100 global brands by financial value is produced by Interbrand. It bases its
calculations on a brand’s financial performance (profits on products and
services, earnings attributable to the brand), its influence on customer choice
and the strength of the brand relative to the competition (Interbrand 2021).
Although Interbrand’s approach does not give estimates of the value of
brands in the future (something that would be useful to investors), it doespage 315
provide a picture of the value of brands in any one year. Calculating the value
of brand equity is an important task since it indicates the rewards that can be
reaped from marketing investments. As mentioned earlier, Apple and Amazon
are each valued at more than $3 trillion and are at the top of the list of 100
global brands; car manufacturers Toyota and Mercedes-Benz are 7th and 8th
respectively, valued at more than $5 billion; luxury fragrance and fashion
brands Chanel and Hermès are 22nd and 23rd respectively, valued at more than
$2 billion; Netflix, Zoom and LinkedIn each gained more than 20 per cent in
value between 2020 and 2021 as they benefited from Covid-19 restrictions,
stay-at-home orders, working from home and home schooling; and a new
entrant, luxury French retailer Sephora, is in 100th place (Interbrand 2021).
Brand Building
The importance of strong brands means brand building is an essential
marketing activity. Successful brand building can reap benefits in terms of
premium prices, achieving distribution more readily, and sustaining high and
stable sales and profits through brand loyalty (Ehrenberg et al. 1990). Strong
brands are also better able to withstand external market forces such as
economic recessions and financial downturns.
A brand is created by augmenting a core product with distinctive values
that distinguish it from the competition. To understand the notion of brand
values, we first need to understand the difference between features and
benefits. A feature is an aspect of a brand that may or may not confer a
customer benefit. For example, adding fluoride (feature) to a toothpaste
confers the customer benefits of added protection against tooth decay and
decreased dental charges. Not all features necessarily confer benefits to all
users. For example, Microsoft Office is a bundle of software programs.
However, for a user who wishes to use only the word processor, the
spreadsheet and PowerPoint software confer no benefits.
Core benefits derive from the core product (see Figure 8.4). Toothpaste, for
example, cleans teeth and therefore protects against tooth decay, but all
toothpastes achieve that. Branding allows marketers to create added values that
distinguish one brand from another. Successful brands are those
that create a set of brand values that are superior to those of other
rival brands. So, brand building involves a deep understanding of both thefunctional (e.g. ease of use) and emotional (e.g. confidence) values that
customers use when choosing between brands, and the ability to combine them
in a unique way to create an augmented product customers prefer. This unique,
augmented product is what marketers call the brand. The success of the
Swatch brand was founded on the recognition that watches could be marketed
as fashion items to younger age groups. By using colour and design, Swatch
successfully augmented a basic product – a watch – to create appeal for its
target market. Swatch combined functional and emotional values to create a
successful and enduring brand. Focusing on functional values is rarely
sufficient.
FIGURE 8.4
Creating a brand
Figure 8.4 shows how products can be augmented. Singapore Airlines has
augmented its brand by providing superior service. Kia has differentiated its
cars by offering seven-year guarantees (warranties) when most of its
competitors offer only three years. Nivea was the first to differentiate its
sunblock brand using innovative packaging that allowed it to be sprayed onto
the body. Netflix created a differential advantage through its innovative
internet-distributed TV services and offering a wide variety of online content,page 316
which satisfies global audiences’ viewing tastes (Lotz 2017). Apple expanded
its offer by creating its app store for its iPhone, which allows anyone to create
and sell an application, providing efficient delivery of extra services to
customers. Kerrygold butter introduced a ‘spreadable’ version of its core
product. Finally, BMW has augmented its brand by its image, embodied in its
‘the ultimate driving machine’ strapline, which differentiates it from the
competition.
Managing brands involves a constant search for ways of achieving the full
brand potential. To do so means the creation of major global brands (e.g.
Apple, Amazon, Google, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, IBM, General Electric, AT&T,
China Mobile). But how are successful brands built? A combination of some or
all of seven factors can be important (see Doyle 1989; King 1991). These are
shown in Figure 8.5 and described below.
FIGURE 8.5
Building successful brands
Quality
It is vital to build quality into the core product; a major reason for brand failure
is the inability to get the basics right. Marketing a vacuum cleaner
that does not pick up dirt effectively or a car that constantly breaks
down is courting disaster. The core product must achieve the basic functionalrequirements expected of it. A major study of factors affecting success has
shown that, statistically, higher-quality brands achieve greater market share
and higher profitability than their inferior rivals (Buzzell and Gale 1987).
Product quality improvements have been shown to be driven mainly by market
pull (changing customer tastes and expectations), organizational push (changes
in the technical potential and resources of a firm) and competitor actions
(Lemmink and Kaspar 1994).
Top firms such as Volkswagen, Guinness, Caterpillar, FedEx, Siemens,
Intel and Google understand the importance of quality in the brand-building
process. Their success has been based on high-quality foundations. Once a
brand is associated with quality, it forms a formidable barrier for competitors
to overcome. Read Hidden Gem 8.1.

The Cheeky Panda
When entrepreneurs Chris and Julie Chen watched bamboo being harvested on Julie’s
parents’ farm in China it gave them an idea about how to make toilet paper more
sustainable. They launched their new brand, with green credentials, in 2016 using a
crowdfunding business model as a test to see if there was interest in the marketplace for
this type of product. By 2017 they had raised investments of £7 million from 4,000 investors
and now have a business with a multi-million-pound turnover serving wholesale and retail
markets. Sales were boosted significantly by panic buying during lockdown as consumers in
the UK worried they would not be able to get hold of household essentials as Covid-19
spread through the world. But now the brand is well established and has a valuation of over
£20 million.

The Cheeky Panda is disrupting the toilet paper market with its sustainable products and
packaging. And the brand has overcome some of the questions about bamboo’s
sustainability credentials. Bamboo is now widely used as a yarn, and there are pros and
cons when it comes to its sustainability. It is a fast-growing crop that needs to be harvested
regularly, it is naturally pest resistant, can help with soil erosion, develops root networks –
which helps when it comes to replanting – requires very little water and grows withoutpage 317
fertilizers. China grows bamboo commercially, but where it is grown as a monocrop it
reduces biodiversity, and when farmers clear natural forest land to grow more bamboo this
destroys the habitat of endangered species including giant pandas.
The Cheeky Panda set out to do things differently. Its products are manufactured from 100
per cent natural virgin pulp bamboo, a waste product from other bamboo manufacturing
processes, and sourced from sustainably managed forests. The firm is a member of the
Solar Impulse Foundation and committed to doing things differently. Its products are vegan
and FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified. The brand’s promise to its customers is 65
per cent reduction in their carbon emissions (bamboo releases 35 per cent more oxygen
and absorbs 30 per cent more carbon then other trees), the reduction of deforestation, and
pesticide-free products, which are ideal for those with allergies. The packaging for all the
products is biodegradable.
Its product range includes toilet roll, kitchen roll, tissues, baby and face wipes, nappy pants
and paper straws, sold through major retailers such as Amazon, Boots and Waitrose in the
UK, and in 25 markets across Europe, the US, China and the Middle East.

Positioning
Creating a unique position in the marketplace involves a careful choice of
target market and the establishing of a clear differential advantage in the minds
of those people. This can be achieved through brand name and image, service,
design, guarantees, packaging and delivery. In today’s highly competitive
global marketplace, unique positioning normally relies on a combination of
these factors. For example, the success of BMW is founded on a high-quality,
well-designed product, targeted at distinct customer segments and supported
by a carefully nurtured exclusive brand name and image. The Four-Cs
framework (clarity, consistency, credibility and competitiveness) discussed in
Chapter 7 acts as a guide to the factors to consider when positioning a brand.
Often the essence of the Four-Cs is used in a brand’s positioning statement.
For example, Mercedes’ ‘precision engineered luxury’ or DHL’s ‘Excellence.
Simply Delivered.’
An analytical framework that can be used to dissect the current position of
a brand in the marketplace and form the basis of a new brand positioningpage 318
strategy is given in Figure 8.6. The strength of a brand’s position in the
marketplace is built on six elements: brand domain, brand heritage, brand
values, brand assets, brand personality and brand reflection. The first of
these, brand domain, corresponds to the choice of target market (where the
brand competes); the other five elements provide avenues for creating a clear
differential advantage with these target consumers.
1. Brand domain: the brand’s target market – that is, where it competes in the
marketplace. For example, the brand domain for Innocent drinks is the
general consumer, whereas it also produces Innocent Smoothie Just for Kids
designed especially for children (see Exhibit 8.5).
2. Brand heritage: the background to the brand and its culture – that is, how it
has achieved success (and failure) over its life. Brand heritage can form an
extremely useful platform to build on, and some brands have long histories
to help them stand out. For example, the foundations of Wolsey (knitwear,
hosiery and underwear for men) stretch back to 1755 and the firm has built
its reputation on a long-standing history of quality design and fabrics, and
its Britishness. Burberry is another fashion brand that has gained from its
history: founded in 1856, its reputation has been built on producing hard￾wearing coats and outerwear, even for polar explorers and pilots. The
Burberry trench coat designed in the 1940s remains a popular choice for
men and women. Exhibit 8.6 shows Kerrygold butter, which uses its
heritage to convey the richness and pureness of the brand – an approach it
uses around the world.
3. Brand values: the core values and characteristics of the brand – for example,
the brand values of Berghaus are high-performance outdoor clothing and the
spirit of adventure; for Lycra they are comfort and fit; for Absolut
Vodka purity and fun; and for Audi, sophistication and
progression. Ethical values are important for brands and companies. For
example, Ecover, Green & Black’s chocolate and Cafédirect coffee all
combine strong brand values with ethical credentials.
4. Brand assets: what makes the brand distinctive from other competing
brands, such as symbols, features, images and relationships. For example,
Puma uses its namesake as its symbol, which distinguishes it from other
brands, IKEA’s blue and yellow underpins its Swedishness and relates to
being full of light and yet restrained, which reflects the country’s culture,
while the Dyson bagless vacuum cleaner is distinguished from traditional
vacuum cleaners. Nivea’s ‘Feel Closer’ strapline and distinctive blue colourcaptures the image of the brand, and the close relationship with customers
developed by IBM over many years is a major brand asset for the firm.
5. Brand personality: the character of the brand described in terms of other
entities, such as people, animals or objects. Marketing researchers ask
consumers to describe brands in these terms. For example, consumers might
be asked, ‘If brand X were a person, what kind of person would it be?’, ‘If
brand X were an animal, what kind of animal would it be?’ or ‘If brand X
were a car, what kind of car would it be?’ See Marketing in Action 8.1 for
further details of the personality of brands.
6. Brand reflection: how the brand relates to self-identity; how the customer
perceives him/herself because of buying/using the brand. The branding
illustration visualizes how people use brands to reflect and project their self￾identity. The importance of brand reflection is apparent in the demand for
aspirational brands such as Gucci handbags, Cartier or Rolex watches, and
Mercedes cars.

MARKETING IN ACTION 8.1
The Personality of a Brand
A brand’s personality is an intangible but important part of the brand image and market
position of goods and services. Like individuals, brands aspire to convey their uniqueness
and the characteristics of their personalities as this can help both in terms of a customer’s
understanding of the brand and also from the firm’s perspective when selecting appropriate
messages and media to use to communicate a brand’s position. Red Bull’s personality is
exciting, and its logo is seen on racing cars, bicycles and at extreme sports events, to
reinforce consumer perceptions.page 319

According to Millward Brown (2012), to understand a brand’s personality it is important to
consider personality characteristics and archetypes. For example, generous and caring
characteristics could be combined with the archetype ‘mother’ in a similar way as
adventurous and brave could be combined with a ‘hero’ archetype. The next step is to
consider what the archetype represents, for example a ‘mother’ archetype could relate to
stability and well-being. To be successful, a brand personality should link to archetypes that
interest a brand’s target audience. For example, the ‘wise’ archetype, with its
characteristics of trustworthiness, has been attributed to Google, China Mobile
and Visa. L’Oréal has been classified as fitting the ‘seductress’ archetype (with
characteristics of being sexy and desirable); its Age Perfect campaign featuring Dame
Helen Mirren added to the list of characteristics, using the words ‘outrageous’ and ‘bold’ in
its advertising message. Some archetypes are less likely to deliver success; having a
friendly personality (like Airtel, Home Depot and KFC) might be straightforward and easy to
understand, but is less likely to stand out from the crowd.
Research also suggests brands may have multifaceted personalities and while one trait is
dominant there might be other facets for consumers to connect with, giving greater scope to
build longer-term relationships. Thus excitement, sincerity and competence may all be part
of the personality of a single brand, enhancing its scope to connect with a broader customer
base.
Based on: Keller (2001); Millward Brown (2012); McManus et al. (2022)
By analysing each element, brand managers can form an accurate portrait
of how brands are positioned in the marketplace. From there, thought can be
given to whether and how the brand can be repositioned to improve
performance.
Repositioning
As markets change and opportunities arise, repositioning may be needed to
build brands from their initial base. Skoda was repositioned from adownmarket car brand of dubious quality to a mid-market brand whose quality
has led to several awards, significant sales and profit growth. Samsung
successfully repositioned from being perceived as a producer of cheap TVs
and microwave ovens to being regarded as a ‘cool’ youth brand producing
mobile phones and flat-screen TVs for the ‘techno savvy’. Marks & Spencer
(M&S) relies on own-label products for most of its sales and is positioned as a
good-quality retailer, but when it suffered declining sales and loss of market
share, the response was a ‘radical transformation’ to stem losses and revive the
business (Wood and Butler 2018). Its ‘Never the Same Again’ programme
involves the brand becoming an agile digital retailer through operational
changes: getting rid of 25 per cent of its high-street store floor space in
clothing and homewares, investing in technology and moving more sales
online (M&S 2020). Historically, M&S has been slow and lacking in
innovation in the online retailing space, so is looking to ‘radically’ reshape the
brand by redefining its brand values and culture to become a vibrant and agile
‘digital first’ brand (Hammett 2018).
Integrated marketing communications
Brand positioning is based on customer perception. To create a clear position
in the minds of a target audience requires considerable thought and effort
regarding the tools (e.g. advertising, sales promotions) and media (e.g.
broadcast, internet) used to communicate brand messages. Integrated
marketing communications, combining the strengths of traditional and digital
media, are often used to promote such successful brands as Coca-Cola, Hertz
car hire, Marmite and Birds Eye. Following a difficult two years for the airline
industry as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Virgin Atlantic airlines launched
a new brand and advertising campaign designed to encourage its customers to
‘see the world differently’ (see Exhibit 8.7).
EXHIBIT 8.7

the world differently’page 320

Marketers can make their brands more noticeable through attractive
display or package design, and through generating customer familiarity with
brand names, brand logos and a brand’s visual appearance. All the
considerations for developing well-blended and integrated communication
campaigns are discussed in detail in Chapters 12 and 13.
Being first
Research has shown pioneer brands are more likely to be successful than
follower brands. For example, Urban et al. (1986) showed, for frequently
purchased consumer goods, the second firm in the market could expect only 71
per cent of the market share of the pioneer, and the third only 58 per cent of the
pioneer’s share. Lambkin (1992) found those pioneers that invest heavily from
the start in building production on a large scale, in securing wide distribution
and in promoting their products achieve the strongest competitive
position and earn the highest long-term returns. (For a useful
summary and further evidence, see Denstadli et al. 2005.) Being first gives a
brand the opportunity to create a clear position in the minds of target
customers before the competition enters the market. It also gives the pioneer
the opportunity to build customer and distributor loyalty (Bainbridge 2013).
Nevertheless, being first into a market with a unique marketing proposition
does not guarantee success; sustained marketing effort is needed, and the
strength to withstand competitor attacks. Bigger returns may come to those
who are first to enter the mass market, for example Apple’s iPad. Microsoft
had introduced the tablet PC in 2000, but did not successfully launch the
product in the mass market, whereas Apple seized the opportunity in 2010 to
capture and develop the market. Indeed, some of the world’s most successful
brands have benefited from following rather than leading, as they have gainedimportant insights from first movers. For example, Google followed AltaVista
in the search engine marketplace as it realized the importance of a clean, clear
user interface that is not cluttered with adverts (McWillians 2009). Gillette is
often considered to have invented the safety razor, but it was not the first brand
to sell this product. Gillette made an important change by adding a disposable
blade to the earlier design, and it was this that enabled it to dominate the
market.
Long-term perspective
Brand building is a long-term activity and can take many years to achieve.
There are many demands on people’s attention, so generating awareness,
communicating brand values and building customer loyalty requires significant
commitment. Management should constantly evaluate brand investment to
ensure they establish and maintain the desired position of a brand in the
marketplace. Unfortunately, it can be tempting to cut back on expenditure in
the short term. Cutting the marketing communication spend by half a million
euros may immediately cut costs and increase profits. For a well-established
brand, sales are unlikely to fall substantially in the short term because of the
effects of past advertising. The result is higher short-term profits. This may be
an attractive proposition for managers in charge of a brand for less than two
years. One way of overcoming this danger is to monitor brand manager (and
brand) performance by measuring brand equity in terms of awareness levels,
brand associations and intentions to buy, and being vigilant in resisting short￾term actions that may cause harm.
Firms also need to be prepared to suffer losses when marketing brands in
entirely new markets. Tesla, Inc. moved into the sustainable transport market
with an innovative electric vehicle, and then reported record losses on its
Model 3 mass-market electric car (Tesla, Inc. 2018). But, by 2021, Tesla had
not only returned its first annual profit but had also become the world’s most
valuable car brand due largely to its environmental credentials (Ford Rojas
2021).
Key Branding Decisionspage 321
Besides the branding decisions discussed so far, marketers face four further
key branding decisions: brand name strategies and choices, rebranding, brand
extension and stretching, and co-branding.
Brand name strategies and choices
Another key decision area is the choice of brand name. Three brand name
strategies can be identified: family, individual and combination.
Brand name strategies
Family brand names A family brand name is used for all products (e.g.
Philips, Microsoft, Heinz, Procter & Gamble, Samsung and Apple). The
goodwill attached to the family brand name benefits all brands, and the use of
the name in advertising helps the promotion of all the brands carrying the
family name. The risk of this though is that, if one of the brands receives
unfavourable publicity or is unsuccessful, the reputation of the whole range of
brands can be tarnished. This is also called umbrella branding. Some
companies create umbrella brands for part of their brand portfolios to
give coherence to their range of products. For example, LEGO
created the umbrella brand of DUPLO for its range of bricks and toys targeting
small children.
Individual brand names An individual brand name does not identify a
brand with a particular firm (e.g. Procter & Gamble does not use the firm’s
name as a brand on products such as Ariel, Fairy Liquid, Daz and Pampers).
This may be necessary when it is believed each brand requires a separate,
unrelated identity. Toyota also abandoned its family brand name when it
launched its upmarket executive car, which was simply called the Lexus. In
some instances, the use of a family brand name when moving into a new
market segment may harm the image of the new product line. The same can be
true when brands make acquisitions. For example, when Coca-Cola acquired
Innocent, the reputation of the latter was damaged as it was viewed as selling
out to a large corporation (Barda 2010) and setting aside its ethical brand
principles. BMW also chose not to attach its family brand name to the Mini,
since it would have detracted from that car’s sense of ‘Britishness’.Combination brand names A combination brand name combines
family and individual brand names to capitalize on the reputation of the firm,
while allowing the individual brands to be distinguished and identified. For
example, in the Apple family, there are the iPad Pro, iPhone, Apple Pencil,
Apple Watch and AirPods (see Exhibit 8.8).

products

Criteria for choosing brand names
The choice of brand name is very important as names convey images. For
example, the brand name Pepsi Max was chosen for Pepsi’s diet cola targeted
at men, as it conveyed a masculine image in a product category associated with
women. So, one criterion for deciding on a good brand name is it should evoke
positive associations.
A second criterion is the brand name should be easy to pronounce and
remember. Short names such as Zoom, Ariel and Mini fall into this category.
There are exceptions to this general rule, as in the case of Häagen-Dazs, which
was designed to sound European in the US where it was first launched. A
brand name may suggest product benefits, such as with Right Guard
(deodorant), Head & Shoulders (anti-dandruff shampoo), PayPal (online
banking and payment service) and Zoom (fast and easy videoconferencing). A
brand name should be distinctive, for example Jaguar (cars), Puma
(sportswear). Technological products may benefit from numerical brand
naming (e.g. Airbus A380, Aston Martin V12 Vantage) or alphanumeric brandpage 322
names (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S22). This also overcomes the need to change
brand names when marketing in different countries.
The question of brand transferability is another brand name consideration.
With the growth of global brands, names increasingly need to be able to work
across geographical boundaries. Companies that do not check the meaning of a
brand name in other languages can be caught out, as when General Motors
launched its Nova car in Spain only to discover later the word meant ‘it does
not go’ in Spanish. The lesson is, brand names must be researched for cultural
meaning before being introduced into a new geographic market. One
advantage of non-meaningful names such as Diageo and Exxon is they transfer
well across national boundaries.
Specialist companies have established themselves as brand name
consultants. Market research is used to test associations, memorability,
pronunciation and preferences. Legal advice is important so a brand name does
not infringe an existing brand name.
Table 8.1 summarizes the issues that are important when choosing a brand
name.

A good brand name should:
evoke positive associations
be easy to pronounce and remember
suggest product benefits
be distinctive

Rebranding
The act of changing a brand name is called rebranding. It can occur at the
product level (e.g. in confectionery, Dime bar changed to Daim, Opal Fruits to
Starburst, Marathon to Snickers) and at the corporate level (e.g. mobile
telecoms providers Orange and T-Mobile merged and were rebranded as
Everything Everywhere (EE), insurer Norwich Union became Aviva and
delivery firm Hermes became Evri).
Rebranding is risky and the decision should not be taken lightly, as a
rebranding exercise can potentially cause a loss of sales of between 5 and 20
per cent (Klara 2015). Abandoning a well-known and, for some, favourite
brand runs the risk of customer confusion, resentment and loss of market
share. When Coca-Cola was rebranded (and reformulated) as New Coke,
negative customer reaction forced the firm to withdraw the new brand and
reinstate the original (Muzellec and Lambkin 2006).
Amazon attempted to rebrand its IMDb TV streaming channel, which
includes adverts (which cannot be skimmed through), as IMDb Freedive, but
this failed to achieve critical mass. So its second attempt was to name thepage 323
service Amazon Freevee, which it targets at ‘budget conscious’ consumers. In
return for watching the adverts, viewers can see premium content without
paying additional subscription fees. The new branding links the service to the
umbrella brand, which transfers the brand values of the parent brand to the
fledgling brand (Glenday 2022).
Brands should ensure a rebrand is essential. Weight Watchers, for example,
believing it was out of touch with its customers, changed its brand name to
WW and, while the firm had correctly identified growing interest in the health
and well-being market, the rebrand did not have the impact required. It was an
expensive mistake, as using WW took the brand away from its core business
‘watching your weight’, meaning it became less recognizable and lost its
differentiated market position (Nicholls 2021).
Why rebrand?
Despite such well-publicized problems, rebranding is a common activity. The
reasons for this are as follows (see Riezebos 2003; Keller 2008).
Merger or acquisition When a merger or acquisition takes place, a new
name may be chosen to identify the new firm. Sometimes a combination of the
original corporate names may be chosen (e.g. when Glaxo Wellcome and
SmithKline Beecham formed GlaxoSmithKline); a completely new name may
be preferred (e.g. when Grand Metropolitan and Guinness became Diageo); or
the stronger corporate brand name may be chosen (e.g. when Nestlé acquired
Rowntree Mackintosh).
Desire to create a new image/position in the marketplace Some
brand names are associated with negative or old-fashioned images. The move
by BT Wireless to drop its corporate brand name was because it had acquired
an old-fashioned, bureaucratic image. Its new brand name, O2
, was chosen
because it sounded scientific and modern, and because focus groups saw their
mobile phones as an essential part of their lives (like oxygen). O2
 was bought
out by Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica in 2006 but retained its brand name.
Similar motivations were behind the rebranding of Andersen Consulting to
Accenture. Image considerations were also prominent when the negative
association of the word ‘fried’ in Kentucky Fried Chicken stimulated the moveto change the name to KFC. Facebook changed its name to Meta as the social
media network sought to develop a future market position for the popular
social media platform. Mark Zuckerberg wants to build an online universe, so
the image of the brand is changing although the firm’s aim remains the same:
‘to bring people together’ (Birch 2021).
The sale or acquisition of parts of a business Brands acquire other
brands for various reasons. In the luxury fashion market, Michael Kors
acquired Jimmy Choo and Coach acquired Kate Spade to bolster their product
portfolios and enable greater marketing capacity to compete with Moët
Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH), Kering and Richemont (Danziger 2017).
GlaxoSmithKline (now GSK) sold multiple brands in a strategic initiative to
reduce costs and refocus parts of the business. Brands divested included
Horlicks, Schwartz spices and other food brands, enabling GSK to focus on
consumer healthcare, respiratory and HIV medicines (BBC News 2018).
Corporate strategy changes When a firm diversifies out of its original
product category, the original corporate brand name may be considered too
limiting. Esso (Standard Oil) changed its name to Exxon as its product
portfolio extended beyond oil. Dixons Retail became Dixons Carphone
because the firm widened its product range strategically to place more
emphasis on mobile technology. Google made a similar change to its parent
firm’s name as it became Alphabet to include more of the firm’s activities
under the brand umbrella; the search engine name was not affected (Birch
2021).
Brand familiarity Sometimes the name of a major product brand owned
by a firm becomes so familiar to customers it supersedes the corporate brand.
In these circumstances, the firm may decide to discard the unfamiliar name in
favour of the familiar. That is why Consolidated Foods became Sara Lee and
Boussois-Souchon-Neuvesel (BSN) became Danone.
International marketing considerations A major driver for rebranding
is the desire to harmonize a brand name across national boundaries to create a
global brand. Companies may also change brand names to discourage parallel
importing. When sales of a premium-priced brand in some countries are
threatened by reimports of the same brand from countries where the brand is
sold at lower prices, rebranding may be used to differentiate the product. Thispage 324
is why the Italian cleaning agent Viakal was rebranded in some European
countries as Antikal.
Legal problems A brand name may contravene an existing legal
restriction on its use. For example, the Yves St Laurent perfume brand
Champagne required a name change because the brand name was protected for
use only with the sparkling wine from the Champagne region of France.
Managing the rebranding process
Rebranding is usually an expensive, time-consuming and risky activity, and
should be undertaken only when there is a clear marketing and financial case
in its favour and a strong marketing plan in place to support its implementation
(Keller 2008). Management should recognize a rebranding exercise can not by
itself rectify more deep-seated marketing problems. Once the decision to
rebrand has been made, two key decisions remain: choosing the new name and
implementing the name change.
Choosing the new brand name The issues discussed earlier in this
chapter regarding choosing brand names are also relevant when changing an
existing name. These are that the new brand name should evoke positive
associations, be easy to pronounce and remember, suggest positive benefits, be
distinctive, be transferable and not infringe an existing registered
brand name; in addition, consideration should be given to the use of
numerals when emphasizing technology. These issues should form the basis of
the first step: setting the rebranding objectives (see Figure 8.7). For example,
key objectives of the new name might be that it should be easily remembered,
evoke positive associations and be transferable across national boundaries.
FIGURE 8.7
The rebranding processThe second step is to generate as many brand names as possible. Potential
sources of names include consumers, employees, distributors, specialist brand
name consultants and advertising agencies.
The third step is to screen the names to remove any with obvious flaws,
such as those that are difficult to pronounce, too close to an existing name,
have adverse double meanings and do not fit with the rebranding objectives.
The objective is to reduce the names to a shortlist of around 6–12. For the
fourth step, an information search is carried out to check that each name does
not infringe on an existing registered brand name in each country where the
brand is, or may be, marketed.
The fifth step is to test the remaining names through consumer research.
The key criteria, such as memorability, associations and distinctiveness,chosen in step one (set rebranding objectives), will be used to assess the
performance of the new names.
Finally, management will assess the virtues of each of the shortlisted brand
names and conclude which one should be chosen and registered.
Implementing the name change Name changes can meet considerable
resistance from consumers, employees and distributors. All three groups can
feel their loyalty to a brand has been betrayed. Attention should be paid to the
media and financial institutions, particularly for corporate name changes.
Careful consideration is required to change a name, and all interested parties
should be involved in the process and understand the logic underlying the
change. Implementing a brand name change requires attention to five key
issues (Kapferer 2008):
1. Coordination: name change requires harmonious working between the firm
departments and those groups most involved – marketing, production, the
sales force, logistics and general management. All must work together to
avoid problems and solve any that may arise.
2. Communication: all stakeholders – for example, customers, employees and
investors – need to be targeted with communications that notify them early
and with a full explanation. When the chocolate bar known as Raider in
continental Europe changed its name to Twix, which was the name used
everywhere else, consumers in Europe were informed by a massive
advertising campaign (two years’ advertising budget was spent in three
weeks). Retailers were told of the name change well in advance by a sales
force whose top priority was the Twix brand. Trial was encouraged by
promotional activities at retail outlets. The result was a highly successful
name change and the creation of a global brand.
3. Understanding what the consumer identifies with the brand: consumer
research is required to understand what consumers identify as the key
characteristics of the brand. Shell made the mistake of failing to include the
new colour (yellow) of the rebranded Shell Helix Standard (from Puissance
7) in its advertising, which stressed only the name change from Puissance 7
in France. Unfortunately, customers, when looking for their favourite brand
of oil, paid most attention to the colour of the can, so they could not find
their usual brown can of Puissance 7, and did not realize it was now in a
yellow can and had a new and unfamiliar name. The lesson is, rebranding
means making sure target audiences are informed of all brand changes.page 325
4. Providing assistance to distributors/retailers: to avoid confusion at
distributors/retailers, manufacturers should avoid double stocking of the old
and new brand, and ensure barcodes and product management systems are
updated. Mars’ management took great care to ensure that, on the day of the
transfer from Raider to Twix, no stocks of Raider would be found in the
shops, even if this meant buying back stock.
5. Speed of change: consideration should be given to whether the change
should be immediate (as with Twix) or subject to a transitional phase where,
for example, the old name is retained (perhaps in small letters) on the
packaging after the rebrand. Old names are retained during a transitional
period when the old name has high awareness and positive associations
among consumers. Retaining an old brand name following a takeover may
be wise for political reasons, as when Nestlé retained the Rowntree name on
its brands for a few years after its takeover of the UK confectionery firm.
Brand extension and stretching
A brand extension is the use of an established brand name (or parent brand)
on a new brand within the same broad market or product category with which
consumers make a connection (Boisvert and Ashill 2011). For example, the
Anadin brand name has been extended to related brands Anadin Extra,
Maximum Strength, Soluble, Paracetamol and Ibuprofen. The Lucozade brand
has undergone a very successful brand extension with the introduction of
Lucozade Sport, which has isotonic properties that help to rehydrate people
more quickly than other drinks and replace the minerals lost through
perspiration. Coca-Cola has extended its Coke brand into Diet Coke, and its
variant form, Diet Coke Cherry. Google extended its core search brand with
many variants including Google Chrome, Google Home, Google Maps and
Google Street View. These are examples of line extensions.
An extreme form of brand extension is known as brand stretching. This is
when an established brand name is used for brands in unrelated markets or
product categories, such as the use of the Yamaha piano’s brand name on hi-fi
equipment, skis and motorcycles. Designer menswear brands like Paul Smith,
Ted Baker and Tommy Hilfiger have also been extended from clothing to
fragrances, footwear and home furnishings. Google moved into smartphoneswith its Pixel 2 and voice-activated speakers with Google Nest. Table 8.3 gives
some examples of brand extensions and stretching.

Some companies have used brand extensions and stretching very
successfully. Richard Branson’s Virgin is a classic example. Beginning in 1970
as Virgin Records, the firm grew through Virgin Music (music publishing),
Megastores (music retailing), Radio, Vodka, Cola, Atlantic Airlines (long-haul
air travel), Express (short-haul air travel), Rail, Money (insurance, credit cards,
mortgages, etc.), One (one-stop online banking), Media (digital TV,
broadband, phone and mobile), Healthcare, and many more. The Virgin Group
has more than 400 subsidiaries.
Brand extension is an important marketing tactic. Two key advantages of
brand extension in releasing new products are it reduces risk and is less costly
than alternative launch strategies (Sharp 1990). Both distributors and
consumers may perceive less risk if the new brand comes with an established
brand name. Distributors may be reassured about the ‘saleability’ of the new
brand and therefore be more willing to stock it. Consumers appear to attribute
the quality associations they have of the original brand to the new one (Aaker
and Keller 1990). An established name enhances consumer interest and
willingness to try the new brand (Aaker 1990). Consumer attitudes towards
brand extensions are more favourable when the perceived quality of the parentpage 326
brand is high (Bottomley and Doyle 1996). For example, Yakult Light is an
extension of the Yakult brand.
Launch costs can also be reduced by using a brand extension strategy.
Since the established brand name is already well known, the task of building
awareness of the new brand is eased. Consequently, advertising, selling and
promotional costs are reduced. Furthermore, there is the likelihood of
achieving advertising economies of scale since advertisements for the original
brand and its extensions reinforce each other (Roberts and McDonald 1989).
Brand extensions also benefit the core brand due to the increase in
marketing expenditure. Core brand sales can increase this enhancement of
consumers’ perception of brand values and image through increased
communication (Grime et al. 2002). However, consumers shop around and
brand extensions that fail to meet expectations will be rejected.
Cannibalization, which refers to a situation where the new brand gains sales at
the expense of the established brand, can also occur. For example, additional
flavour extensions of the Absolut Vodka brand were found to cannibalize sales
of existing ones, leading to a refocus on the original brand (Bokaie 2008).
Internationally, the connection between parent brands and brand extensions
can impact on consumers differently. So brands need to consider local market
reactions, assess the impact of the new product and find ways to ensure the
enhanced status of the parent brand before launching extensions in certain
regions. Research into luxury brands found parent brands conferred familiarity,
quality signals and authenticity to the new product, but there was a difference
between the strength of connections made with the new product depending on
where the customers lived. In France, there was stronger connection to a
luxury brand’s authenticity than in the US (Boisvert and Ashill 2022). Now
read Marketing in Action 8.2 to discover how Lotus Bakeries extended and
stretched its brands.
MARKETING IN ACTION 8.2
Developing the Lotus Bakeries Brand of CaramelizedBiscuit
Caramelized biscuits are an original Belgian speciality. Lotus Bakeries, family-owned since
1932, has acquired international exposure thanks to this flagship product. This Belgian firm
is very small compared with Mondelèz International or United Biscuits, but it has succeeded
in cornering a growing share of a niche market. The market in question is the speculoos
market, which consists of suppliers of a type of spiced shortcrust biscuit. In Belgium, Lotus’s
version of speculoos is a top product across the biscuit market. The biscuits are also
proving increasingly popular internationally, which means today more than 75 per cent of
sales are realized outside Belgium. Lotus Bakeries annually manufactures six billion of the
lightly spiced, thin and crunchy biscuits for export to 40 countries. With its modern
rectangular shape, the Lotus biscuit has been widely adopted by bars and quality
restaurants around the world.

Speculoos is the name used to market Lotus original caramelized biscuits in Belgium and
France. However, Lotus Biscoff (a fusion of ‘biscuits for coffee’, a shorter, snappier name)
was chosen as a product brand name for the US, quickly replacing the original caramelized
biscuit brand in other international markets, including the UK, where the Biscoff brand name
was introduced in March 2014. Speculoos is Lotus Bakeries’ largest and most important
product group, and has driven the group’s growth in recent years, especially outside
Belgium. Given its strategic importance, major sales and marketing efforts have been made
to stimulate the product’s further development and growth.
Brand line extensions
Alongside family packs and pocket-size formats of the Original Speculoos, developed in
most countries, as well as a chocolate version, Lotus Bakeries is testing, in its traditional
markets of Belgium and France, other line extensions among which are Original Speculoos
Crumbs, Rolls and Minis.
Brand stretching
After launching a Lotus Speculoos ice cream, Lotus Bakeries innovated in 2008 and
conquered a new market with its spreadable version of the Original Lotus Speculoos.
Introduced year-by-year to many countries, including the UK, where the brand has become
a firm favourite, it is used creatively in a range of recipes shared by customers. Retail giants
Sainsbury’s and Waitrose saw sales of Biscoff Spread (smooth and crunchy versions)page 327
rocket. Following its successful debut, the product was launched in 20 g packs for catering
and food services. A chocolate version of the spread can also be found in Quebec, Canada.
Lotus Bakeries continues to expand by focusing on the quality of its core products:
caramelized biscuits, gingerbread, waffles, speciality cakes and Dinosaurs biscuits. In 2020,
the Biscoff Sandwich Cookie and the Lotus Biscoff Chocolate became available in
European supermarkets.
Based on: Flambard-Ruaud and Daly (2012); Lotus Bakeries (2018, 2021)
Brands should be aware of the risks. A major test of any brand extension
opportunity is to ask whether the new brand concept is compatible with the
values inherent in the core brand: it will not be viable when a new brand is
being developed for a target group that holds different values and
aspirations from those in the original market segment. When this
occurs, the use of the brand extension tactic would detract from the new brand.
The answer is to develop a separate brand name, as with Toyota’s Lexus and
Seiko with its Pulsar brand developed for the lower-priced mass market for
watches.
Finally, management needs to guard against loss of credibility if a brand
name is extended too far. This is particularly relevant when brand stretching.
The use of the Pierre Cardin name for such disparate products as clothing,
toiletries and cosmetics has diluted the brand name’s credibility (Aaker 1990).
Brand extensions are likely to be successful if they make sense to the
consumer. If the values and aspirations of the new target segment(s) match
those of the original segment, and if the qualities of the brand name are
likewise highly prized, then success is likely. The prime example is Marks &
Spencer, which extended from clothing to food based on its core values of
quality and reliability.
Co-branding
There are two major forms of co-branding: product-based co-branding and
communications-based co-branding (see Figure 8.8).
FIGURE 8.8
Forms of co-brandingProduct-based co-branding
Product-based co-branding involves the linking of two or more existing
brands from different companies or business units to form a product in which
the brand names are visible to consumers. There are two variants: parallel and
ingredient co-branding. Parallel co-branding occurs when two or more
independent brands join forces to produce a combined brand. An example is
Häagen-Dazs ice cream and Baileys liqueur combining to form Häagen-Dazs
with Baileys flavour ice cream. Although Baileys liqueur seems to be an
ingredient brand, it is not, since its main market positioning is as an
independent brand (a liqueur) not as an ingredient of ice cream. Other
examples include the Apple Nike Watch, which links with the Nike Run Club
app, targeting fitness, timekeeping and more; while rap artist Kayne West
partnered with sportswear brand Adidas to develop premium footwear brand
Yeezy (see Exhibit 8.9); this was a combination of a personal and product
brand.
EXHIBIT 8.9

Ingredient co-branding is found when one supplier explicitly chooses to
position its brand as an ingredient of a product. Intel is an ingredient brand. It
markets itself as a key component (ingredient) of computers. The ingredient
co-brand is formed by the combination of the ingredient brand and the
manufacturer brand, for example Hewlett-Packard or Sony. In a different vein,
luxury brands have partnered with gaming companies to provide ‘skins’ for
avatars, for example Marc Jacobs and Valentino in Animal Crossing and Louis
Vuitton in League of Legends (Bennet 2020). Usually, the names and logos of
both brands appear on the computer.
Figure 8.9 illustrates the distinction between parallel and ingredient co￾branding.
FIGURE 8.9
Parallel and ingredient co-brandingAdvantages The advantages of product-based co-branding are as follows.
Added value and differentiation: The co-branding alliance of two or more
brands can capture multiple sources of brand equity, and therefore add value
and provide a point of differentiation. If co-branding is going to work, there
need to be certain contrasts between the brands so their joining together brings
synergistic benefits. In the case of the Missoni for Target collection, Missoni’s
design flair adds value and enables the retailer (US retail department store
brand Target) to associate more closely with premium brands. For Missoni, the
biggest benefit is creating brand awareness in North America. Both companies
cater for different audiences, so strong co-branding can again deliver added
benefits by giving access to new customers. The potential benefits of
successful co-branding are better-integrated communication, organizational
learning, increased brand equity and improved profits. Other examples include
Stella McCartney, who partnered with LVMH to boost the global profile of the
fashion brand (Barr 2019); Zara and Everlast (boxing brand) collaborated to
develop a range of sports-led styles for sweatshirts shorts and coats; Gucci and
North Face (outdoor wear) came together with colourful prints and outdoor￾wear styles to produce sell-out collections; Kayne West recently partnered the
aforementioned Yeezy with Gap and Balenciaga, becoming a hit with
followers on Instagram and at yeezygap.com, with T-shirts, jackets and jeans
hoodies differentiated as ‘timeless silhouettes of a dystopian capsule wardrobe’
(Tashjian 2022).page 329
Positioning: A co-brand can position a product for a target market. Best
Western International hotel group and Harley-Davidson Motor Company
entered into partnership to promote Rider Friendly hotels. The deal brought
advantages for both companies as well as for customers: Best Western gained
access to motorcycling enthusiasts who like to travel; Harley-Davidson
demonstrated its commitment to getting the best for its customers, who on
arrival at the hotel could enjoy selected benefits (PR Newswire 2013). Levi’s
Jeans joined with Pinterest to create customized branded boards to connect
with potential customers and showcase products more closely aligned with
their preferences. Pinterest’s visual discovery tools help Levi’s customers to
‘shop the look’ and receive personalized recommendations (Hutchinson 2020).
Reduction of cost of product introduction: Co-branding can reduce the cost
of product introduction since two well-known brands are combined,
accelerating awareness, acceptance and adoption (Keller 2008). Consumer
technology manufacturer LG and Google joined forces and agreed to share
their patent portfolios in a deal that aims to reduce costs and create
opportunities for the development of future innovative products and services;
this recently saw Google’s cloud gaming service Stadia incorporated into LG
smart TVs. The two brands are also collaborating to produce AI and 5G
services, to reap further benefits.
Risks As with other co-branding exercises, there are also risks involved in
product-based co-branding.
Loss of control: Given the co-brand is managed by two different
companies (or at the very least different strategic business units of the same
firm), each loses a degree of control over decision-making. There is potential
for disagreement, misunderstanding and conflict. For example, American
Express decided to end its co-branding relationship with Costco Wholesale
because the two corporations could not agree on acceptable terms. The credit
card firm saw its stock price fall significantly over the break-up of this unusual
partnership, in which Costco exclusively accepted Amex cards (Sidel 2015).
LEGO ended its partnership with Royal Dutch Shell plc after getting
embroiled in an environmental debate over drilling in the Artic. Events came
to a head when Greenpeace launched a video that attracted more than six
million views online. This had been a long-standing partnership between thetoy maker and the oil producer, extending back more than 40 years. LEGO had
distribution agreements with Shell to sell its toys in petrol stations in 25
countries and made branded Shell petrol station toys (Vaughan 2014). Exhibit
8.10 shows how LEGO’s actions were portrayed.
EXHIBIT 8.10

Loss of brand equity: Poor performance of the co-brand could have
negative effects on the original brands. In particular, each or any of the original
brands’ images could be tarnished.
Communications-based co-branding
Communications-based co-branding involves the linking of two or more
existing brands from different companies or business units for the purposes of
joint communication. This type of co-branding can take the form of
recommendation. For example, Ariel (detergent brand) and Whirlpool (home
appliances) launched a co-branded advertising campaign where Ariel was
endorsed by Whirlpool (Kapferer 2008). The two brands have continued to
work together on international ad campaigns with the #ShareTheLoad social
media campaign (Bapna 2022). A second variant is when an alliance is formedpage 330
to stimulate awareness and interest, and to provide promotional opportunities.
An example is Shell’s sponsorship of the Ferrari Formula 1 motor racing team.
As part of the deal, the Shell brand name appears on Ferrari cars; the two
brands have a long-standing and successful partnership, which has resulted in
strong innovation (Shell plc 2022).
Advantages The advantages of communications-based co-branding are as
follows.
Endorsement opportunities: For example, Whirlpool and Ariel engaged in
mutual endorsement in their advertising campaign. Endorsement may also be
one-way: Shell gains by being associated with the highly successful
international motor racing brand Ferrari.
Cost benefits: One of the parties in the co-branding may provide resources
to the other. Shell’s deal with Ferrari demands Shell pay huge sums of money,
which helps Ferrari support the costs of motor racing. Also, joint advertising
alliances mean costs can be shared.
Awareness and interest gains: The McDonald’s/Disney alliance means new
Disney movies are promoted in McDonald’s outlets, enhancing awareness and
interest, and Happy Meals contain figures from Disney brands.
Promotional opportunities: As we have discussed, McDonald’s gained
from the in-store promotional opportunities afforded by its co-branding
alliance with Disney.
Risks The risks involved in communications-based co-branding are like
those of product-based co-branding.
Loss of control: Each party to the co-branding activity loses some of its
control to the partner. For example, in joint advertising there could be conflicts
arising from differences of opinion regarding creative content and the
emphasis given to each brand in the advertising. For example, LEGO ended its
partnership with Shell because Greenpeace campaigned against the oil firm’s
plans to start drilling for oil in the Arctic. LEGO felt it should not be drawn
into this dispute, and so to protect the brand it withdrew (Trangbaek 2014).
Brand equity loss: No one wants to be associated with failure. Poor
performance of one brand could tarnish the image of the other. For example,an unsuccessful Disney movie prominently promoted in McDonald’s outlets
could rebound on the latter. Conversely, bad publicity for McDonald’s might
harm the Disney brand by association.
Global Branding
Global branding is the achievement of brand penetration worldwide.
Theodore Levitt, a champion of global branding, argued in the 1950s that
intensified competition and technological developments would force firms to
operate globally, ignoring superficial national differences. Trade growth
around the world has increased considerably since then, but it is also important
to recognize the globalization of firms and brands has spread a consumer
culture and created global supply chains that support trade. Fifty years ago
consumer culture relied on localized cues to inform buying choices, but these
days many brands have become global cultural icons: Amazon’s ‘A–Z smile’,
Nike’s swoosh, Twitter’s bird (Steenkamp 2019).
Table 8.4 depicts the world’s largest brands by continent, industry and
turnover. The dominance of technology brands in Northern America and Asia
is clear. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Samsung, Microsoft and Google lead the
way in brand valuations. Automotive brands are the next highest in terms of
collective brand value in Europe (Mercedes-Benz, VW, BMW) and in Asia
(Toyota, Honda and Mitsubishi). Consumer goods brands such as Coca-Cola,
Starbucks and MacDonald’s maintain very high values, while retail brands
have lower valuations.
TABLE 8.4 Global brand values by continent and industry
Most Valuable brands in 2020
Brand Industry Value
Amazon Retail $221B
Google Tech $160B
Apple Tech $141B
Microsoft Tech $117B
Samsung Tech  $94BICBC Banking  $81B
Facebook Media  $80B
Walmart Retail  $78B
Ping An Insurance  $69B
Huawei Tech  $65B
So Levitt’s position is in part accurate: the new commercial reality in the
shape of the emergence of global markets for standardized products and
services has developed on a previously unimagined scale. Furthermore
Steenkamp (2019) observed five ways global brands create value:
1. Consumer preference for global brands, as they can be perceived to be of
higher quality, has also been found to positively affect consumers’ belief a
brand is prestigious (Steenkamp et al. 2003) and culturally more influential
(e.g. Mercedes-Benz, Tesla).
2. Organizational benefits: the creation of global brands can speed up a
product’s time to market if it is possible to reduce time-consuming local
modifications and create corporate identities on a global scale (e.g. Shell,
IKEA, Visa, Facebook, Honda, Samsung).
3. Marketing benefits: global campaigns have extended budgets, which can
enable superior branding campaigns. Bringing together resources across
countries means leveraging the best marketing ideas. For example, the
Coca-Cola ‘Share A Coke’ campaign started with adding personal names to
bottles of Coke in Australia and eventually reached more than 80 countries,
raising the brand’s market share globally (Doland 2015).
4. Economic benefits: the prospect of global efficiencies and economic gains in
production, procurement, research and development. For example, Walmart
is a retailer operating on a global scale; it sells thousands of different
products, with its elaborate and efficient supply chains, e-commerce
operation, omnichannel strategy and automated warehouses enabling it to be
the world’s largest retail brand (Banker 2021).
5. Transnational innovation: global research and development enables better
products, frugal innovation, and greater focus on and deployment of
sustainable practices and technological innovations.page 331
However, even though global consumer culture is dominating now, and
symbols, values and ideals from developed nations have powerful influences,
there are factors that can shape consumer demand locally. For instance, in
emerging markets, consumers have been found to rely more on intangible cues
and stereotyping when evaluating brands than do consumers in more
developed economies (Diamantopoulos et al. 2021). This means care should be
taken when developing communication strategies for a brand and drawing
generalized conclusions about consumer behaviours in developed and
developing countries, as what works well in the former may not work as
effectively in the latter.
Globally, consumers seek reliable, quality products at a low price, and the
marketing task is to offer the same products and services in the same way,
thereby achieving enormous global economies of scale. Asian economies are
being successful in achieving these kinds of economies to produce high￾quality, competitively priced global brands (e.g. Toyota, Honda, Sony and
Canon in Japan). In the future, Steenkamp (2019) suggests, political unrest,
market protectionism and other forces may alter the shape of global brand
strategies and the relevance of local cultural influences.
In Europe, the promise of pan-European branding has caused leading
manufacturers to seek to extend their market coverage and to build their
portfolio of brands. Nestlé has widened its brand portfolio by the acquisition of
such companies as Rowntree (confectionery) and Buitoni-Perugina (pasta and
chocolate), and formed a joint venture (Cereal Partners) with US giant General
Mills to challenge Kellogg’s in the European breakfast cereal market. Mars
replaced its Treets and Bonitos brands with M&M’s, and in 1990 changed the
name of its third-largest UK brand, Marathon, to the Snickers name used in the
rest of Europe.
Some global successes, such as Coca-Cola, BMW, Gucci and McDonald’s,
can be noted, but national variations in taste and consumption patterns will
ensure such achievements will be limited in the future. For example, the
French eat more yoghurt, the British eat more chocolate and the Dutch drink
more coffee than other European nations; this reflects the kinds of national
differences that affect the marketing strategies of manufacturers. Indeed, many
so-called global brands are not standardized, claim the ‘local’ marketers. Forexample, Nescafé has many different varieties of its classic instant coffee
blend, the aim being to suit local tastes.
When entering international markets, brands should consider which parts
of the brand can be standardized and which must be varied across countries. A
useful way of looking at this decision is to separate out the elements that
comprise the brand, as shown in Figure 8.10. Can brand name and image,
advertising, service, guarantees, packaging, quality and design, and delivery be
standardized?
FIGURE 8.10
Global branding decisions
Gillette’s global success with its Sensor, Fusion and Mach 3 razors was
based on a highly standardized approach: the product, brand name, message,
advertising visuals and packaging were standardized; only the voiceovers in
the advertisements were changed to cater for 26 languages across Europe, the
US and Japan.page 332
Lever Brothers found many years ago, for detergent products, brand image
and packaging could be standardized, but the brand name, communications
execution and brand formulation needed to vary across countries (Halliburton
and Hünerberg 1993). Brand image and packaging were the same, but the
name and formulation (fragrance, phosphate levels and additives) differed
between countries.
In other circumstances, the brand form may remain the same across
countries, but the brand communications may need to be modified.
Consequently, differing advertising appeals would be needed to communicate
the concept of exclusiveness in these countries.
Much activity has taken place over recent years to achieve global and pan￾European brand positions. There are three major ways of doing this, as
outlined below (Barwise and Robertson 1992):
1. geographic extension – taking present brands into the geographic markets
2. brand acquisition – purchasing brands
3. brand alliance – joint venture or partnerships to market brands in national or
cross-national markets.
Brand acquisition gives the fastest method of developing global brands.
For example, Unilever’s acquisition of Fabergé, Elizabeth Arden and Calvin
Klein immediately made it a major player in fragrances, cosmetics and
skincare.
Brand alliance usually gives moderate speed. For example, the use of the
Nestlé name for the Cereal Partners (General Mills and Nestlé) alliance’s
breakfast cereals (e.g. Cheerios, Shreddies, Shredded Wheat) in Europe helped
retailer and consumer acceptance.
Geographic extension may be the slowest method, unless the firm is a
major global player with extensive resources, as brand building from scratch is
a costly process. Many brands are attempting to enter rapidly expanding
markets in China, with varying degrees of success. For example, Louis Vuitton
entered markets in Asia to grow its business by exploiting demand for luxury
goods in China and Japan, although the Covid-19 pandemic caused a dip in
sales in 2020. However, marketing efforts have helped to drive market growth,
for example singer Kris Wu’s catwalk appearance was a trending topic on
Weibo, China’s popular social media app (Indvik 2020). IKEA entered Chinapage 333
with its own e-commerce website, but its online trade was low, so it launched
an online store with Alibaba to reach more Chinese customers (Milne 2020).
Geographic extension provides a high degree of control, since companies
can choose which brands to globalize and can plan their global extensions.
Brand acquisition gives a moderate degree of control, although many may
prove difficult to integrate with in-house brands. Brand alliance fosters the
lowest degree of control, as strategy and resource allocation will need to be
negotiated with the partner.
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapterpage 334 Detailed Review
1. The concept of a product, brand, product line and product mix
A product is anything capable of satisfying customer needs.
A brand is a distinctive product offering created using a name, symbol, design,
packaging, or some combination of these, intended to differentiate it from its
competitors.
A product line is a group of brands that are closely related in terms of the functions
and benefits they provide.
A product mix is the total set of products marketed by a firm.
2. The difference between manufacturer and own-label brands
Manufacturer brands are created by producers and bear their chosen brand name,
whereas own-label brands are created and owned by distributors (e.g.
supermarkets).
3. The difference between a core and an augmented product (the brand)
A core product is anything that provides the central benefits required by
customers.
An augmented product is produced by adding extra functional and/or emotional
values to the core product, and combining them in a unique way to form a brand.
4. Why strong brands are important
Strong brands are important because they enhance firm value, act as a barrier to
competition because of their impact on consumer perceptions and preferences,
produce high profits and market share, act as a form of quality certification, aid
consumers’ decision-making and build trust among consumers.
5. Brand equity, its components and the concept of brand valuation
Brand equity is a measure of the strength of a brand in the marketplace by adding
tangible value to a firm through the resulting sales and profits.
Sources of customer-based brand equity are brand awareness and brand image.
Sources of proprietary-based brand equity are patents and channel relationships.
Brand valuation is the process of estimating the financial value of an individual or
corporate brand.
6. How to build strong brands
Strong brands can be built by:
building quality into the core product, creating a unique position in the
marketplace
repositioning to take advantage of new opportunities
using well-blended communications to create a clear position in the minds of
the target audience
being first into the market with a unique marketing proposition.page 335
7. The characteristics and differences between family, individual and combined
brand names
A family brand name is one used for all products in a range; an individual brand
name does not identify a brand with a firm; a combination brand name combines
family and individual brand names.
The characteristics of an effective brand name are: it should evoke positive
associations, be easy to pronounce and remember, suggest product benefits, be
distinctive, use numerics or alphanumerics when emphasizing technology, be
transferable and not infringe on existing registered brand names.
8. Why companies rebrand, and how to manage the process
Companies rebrand to create a new identity after merger or acquisition, to create a
new image/position in the marketplace, to reflect that a major product brand is
more familiar to consumers than the old corporate brand, for international
marketing reasons (e.g. name harmonization across national borders), for
consolidation of brands within a national boundary, in response to legal problems
(e.g. restrictions on use).
Managing the rebranding process involves choosing the new brand name and
implementing the name change.
9. The concepts of brand extension and stretching, their uses and
limitations
A brand extension is the use of an established brand name on a new brand within
the same broad market or product category; brand stretching occurs when an
established brand is used for brands in unrelated markets or product categories.
The advantages are reduced perceived risk of purchase on the part of distributors
and consumers, the use of the established brand name raises consumers’
willingness to try the new brand, the positive associations of the core brand should
rub off onto the brand extension, the awareness of the core brand lowers
advertising and other marketing costs, the introduction of the extension can raise
sales of the core brand due to the enhancement of consumers’ perception of brand
values and image through increased communication.
The limitations are that poor performance of the brand extension could rebound on
the core brand, the brand may lose credibility if stretched too far, sales of the
extension may cannibalize sales of the core brand and the use of a brand
extension strategy may encourage a focus on minor brand modifications rather
than true innovation.
10. The two major forms of co-branding, and their advantages and risks
The two major forms of co-branding are product-based (parallel and ingredient)
co-branding and communications-based co-branding.
The advantages of product-based co-branding are added value and differentiation,
the enhanced ability to position a brand for a particular target market, and the
reduction of the cost of product introduction.
The risks of product-based co-branding are loss of control and potential brand
equity loss if poor performance of the co-brand rebounds on the original brands.
The advantages of communications-based co-branding are endorsement
opportunities, cost benefits, awareness and interest gains, and promotional
opportunities.page 336
The risks of communications-based co-branding are loss of control and potential
brand equity loss.
11. The arguments for and against global and pan-European branding, and the
strategic options for building such brands
The arguments ‘for’ are: intensified global competition and technological
developments, customer convergence of tastes and needs, and the prospect of
global efficiencies of scale will encourage companies to create global brands.
The arguments ‘against’ are: national variations in taste and consumption patterns
will limit the development of global brands.
The strategic options are geographic extension, brand acquisition and brand
alliances.

CASE 15
DR. MARTENS: ENGAGING
CONSUMERS FOR MORE
THAN HALF A CENTURYBoot Rebellion: From Medical Aid to Foot￾stamping Hit
Dr. Martens, also commonly known as Doc Martens, Docs or DMs, is a British footwear and
clothing brand. The brand is mainly associated with boots, but over the years has extended its
product range and now sells a wide range of shoes, sandals, backpacks, bags and accessories
under the Dr. Martens brand. The origins of this iconic boot date back to 1945 when Dr Klaus
Maertens, a 25-year-old soldier and medical doctor at the time, returned to Munich after the
Second World War, nursing a broken foot. Finding the generic leather-soled military boots he
had been provided with hard and uncomfortable, he was driven to create something more
comfortable (Prendergast 2017). He went on to develop a prototype of a unique air-cushioned
sole that would provide more cushioning and traction. Maertens showed it to friend and
engineer Dr Herbert Funk, and the two went into partnership and began using discarded rubber
and other redundant military supplies to produce their innovative footwear (Smith 2018).

By 1947, the duo had begun formal production of their unique shoe and their business grew
rapidly. Within a decade, they had a booming business and opened their first factory in Munich
(Dr. Martens 2022). By 1959, Maertens and Funk had begun looking to expand their business
overseas. British shoe manufacturer R. Griggs Group bought the patent rights, adjusted the
design of the heel, introduced the signature yellow stitching, trademarked the soles as Air Wair
and anglicized the brand name in the process (Prendergast 2017). In April 1960, the iconic
eight-hole 1460 (named after the date it was first launched, 1.4.60) Dr. Martens boot was born,
and the following year the 1461 shoe arrived. Both remain at the core of the Dr. Martens
Originals range (Dr. Martens 2022). Initially sold as workwear boots, Dr. Martens became
popular among postal workers, factory workers and police officers, and were embraced by the
British working class. However, in the following decades Dr. Martens became entwined with
music and youth culture, with different genres through the years adopting them as their own.
The boot and shoemaker has long had ties with the music industry and is famous for kitting out
musicians such as Pete Townshend, Sid Vicious and Lady Gaga (King 2021). For many years
the brand thrived, becoming a symbol of rebelliousness and independence from authority,
popular with mods, skinheads, punks and goths (Gapper 2021).
Revitalizing the Brandpage 341
As the brand turned 40 and the new millennium began, the firm enjoyed its best year for sales,
with the company selling £250 million worth of boots in 2000 alone. However, soon after, sales
declined so dramatically that all but one of its UK factories had to be closed to stave off
bankruptcy. Only 5 million pairs of Dr. Martens were sold in 2003, half the 1990s level of sales
(Browne 2004). In response to this, production work was relocated to China and Thailand, to
reduce costs. Only one Dr. Martens factory remained in England, in Northamptonshire, and this
factory is today responsible for making the brand’s ‘Made in England’ collection, as well as
vintage pairs of Dr. Martens boots and brand collaborations. The factory makes 100,000 pairs
of shoes a year, but this accounts for only 1 per cent of the pairs made overall –
the other 99 per cent are made in Asia. In 2013, Dr. Marten’s owner, R. Griggs
Group, was bought by the investment firm Permira Funds for £300 million (BBC 2013). Under
the Permira Funds ownership, the plan was to migrate the business from a manufacturing-led
push model to a consumer-focused pull model. In addition, Permira wanted to develop a much
more focused product strategy around core icon products, and to invest significantly in people
and systems, while shifting the brand’s channel strategy to direct-to-consumer sales (Permira
2022).
Revitalization of the brand began with collaborations with high-fashion designers from around
the world, such as Jimmy Choo and Vivienne Westwood, reinterpreting and customizing the
classic 1460 boot (Pyke 2021). Indeed, one way Dr. Martens has retained its relevance is
through a consistently intelligent approach to collaboration. The brand’s partnerships have
spanned luxury fashion, mass market and culture, ensuring it finds favour with a broad
spectrum of consumers. The brand has intermittently produced runway footwear for labels
including Raf Simons, COMME des GARÇONS and UNDERCOVER, specializing mostly in
new adaptations of the 1460. In 2020, the brand also embarked upon a 12-month series of
designer reimaginings of the 1460, pairing with the likes of Marc Jacobs and Bodega on
collaborative releases – as well as the Penton Loafer with Stüssy – while its success in Asia
has also resulted in collaborations with brands like Yohji Yamamoto, BAPE, Engineered
Garments and BEAMS (Willson 2021).
Another factor contributing to the brand’s revitalization has been its willingness to adapt to
changing consumer needs. For example, since 2011 Dr. Martens has offered consumers a
version of its shoes, boots, sandals and bags that are made from vegan leather (Atkin 2022). At
the time of these products’ introduction in 2011, the brand was somewhat ahead of the curve in
making the move to produce items made from ‘synthetic’ material (rather than leather).
According to CEO Kenny Wilson, sales of Dr. Martens vegan line have proven hugely popular
and have grown by ‘multiple hundreds of per cent’ in recent years (Bain 2019). As the brand
continues to adapt to changing trends, Dr. Martens is making moves into the repair and resale
market, through a collaboration with online second-hand clothing marketplace Depop and the
Boot Repair Company (Butler 2022). As part of the brand’s ReSouled scheme, used Dr.
Martens boots can be repolished, given new laces, soles, heel loops and insoles before they
are returned to the market at around 80 per cent of the price of a new pair. These lower-priced
offerings have a wider appeal amid an increasing interest in sustainability (Lim 2022). It is
predicted that these refurbished or second-hand boots could account for up to 15 per cent of
the brand’s sales in 10 years’ time (Butler 2022).
Embracing Digital
After more than 60 years on the market, Dr. Martens has seen its customers change and it has
had to respond by changing the way it connects with them. While Dr. Martens prides itself on
not chasing trends for the sake of it, one trend it has followed is the shift to digital. The brand
has moved its focus to engaging its global consumer base in a ‘relevant and digitally nativepage 342
way’. According to Darren Campbell, chief product and marketing officer at Dr. Martens, ‘As
much as out-of-home is not going to go away, we are finding that consumer engagement is
coming more through the digital lens’ (Hammett 2019). The brand has committed to increasing
its marketing investment, which according to CEO Kenny Wilson, the ‘vast majority’ of will go on
digital channels, with some money on out-of-home to build a ‘proximity effect’ to stores. The
theory behind the digital spend is that many consumers buy their first Dr. Martens when they’re
in the 15–25 age bracket and, according to Wilson, ‘That demographic usually has a mobile
phone pinned in their hand.’ The brand plans to invest further in processes and IT to ‘unlock
value’ and transform its use of technology, as well as drive loyalty with product (Innes 2022).
In particular, the brand has recognized and leveraged the growing importance of social media
and has used its social media channels to be interactive and create a community that builds on
the brand’s reputation. For example, in 2019 it successfully launched a series of short films that
were part of a campaign called ‘Tough as You’. These films told the stories of four individuals
who had shown resilience and overcome adversity to become who they are today. This
campaign was used again in 2020, featuring six more individuals, but in order to promote
engagement, a call to action was included, posing the question ‘What does tough mean to
you?’ The intention was to promote engagement, and encourage wearers of the brand to reflect
on what it means to be tough and share their personal stories of resilience (Thorpe 2020). The
films were supported by digital display and out-of-home advertising, as well as an always-on
content strategy. The campaign was successful in growing the brand’s footprint in both new and
existing audiences (particularly Gen Z), while educating people about the brand’s rich heritage
of empowerment and diversity (Moore and Lawlor 2020). In early 2022 the brand announced an
initiative to further its strong ties with the music industry, unveiling a new social-first push to
support up-and-coming musicians. #TeamUpOnTheTrack was an Instagram
campaign created by Dr. Martens in association with the digital agency We Are
Social, which invited Dr. Martens followers to use their skills to create music visuals for new
artist Cariss Auburn Taylor. The entries were judged by the artist herself, with the winner
receiving a prize of £5,000. This campaign was a great example of Dr. Martens engaging with
its community on a truly collaborative project (Houston 2022).
When it comes to digital, Dr. Martens has also focused its efforts on growing the brand through
its own direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels to enable control of brand engagement and drive
greater profit margins. It took the decision to take back control of the brand, selling direct to
consumers via its own stores and website. The brand sees this as important in enabling it to
showcase the brand in the best possible way and engage with consumers. In addition, it has
also found it to be the most profitable route to market. The focus of this DTC offering is its e￾commerce channel, which offers consumers an extended product range on its own website,
drmartens.com (The Quality Compound 2022). In 2021, almost two-thirds of the iconic brand’s
shoe sales were direct to customers and this is now seen as a key strategy for international
growth (Rigby 2021). Dr. Martens’ e-commerce platform is complemented by the brand’s retail
channel, comprising 158 own-retail stores as of 31 December 2021. According to Dr. Martens,
the directly operated stores act both as brand beacons and drivers for e-commerce growth, as
new stores increase brand awareness (Dr. Martens 2022).
Conclusion
The brand’s current geographical footprint, in terms of total revenue, is 85 per cent represented
by the US and the EMEA countries (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). However, given the
attractiveness and high growth rates of the Asia-Pacific region, Dr. Martens believes that the
brand’s relative under-representation in this market represents a strong future growth
opportunity for the brand, in particular in China and Japan (The Quality Compound 2022).page 343
In 2022, Dr. Martens celebrated its 62nd anniversary and, after all these years, the iconic brand
has managed to stay at the forefront of fashion. In the six decades plus since its inception, the
brand has been adopted by a diverse range of groups, celebrities, musicians and freethinking
individuals, and its durable design has meant it has become something of a wardrobe staple
across the globe (De Wolfe 2020).
Dr. Martens has become one of the most iconic footwear brands in the world and, in 2021, was
selling more than 12.5 million pairs of footwear annually in 60-plus countries (Permira 2022). As
a reflection of its ongoing success, in January 2021 the brand completed a successful IPO on
the London Stock Exchange, which represented a major milestone in the brand’s history
(Wilson 2021). The brand appears to be going from strength to strength, as is evidenced by the
fact that it sold more boots than ever in 2021, with sales growing by 18 per cent to £908.3
million in the year to the end of March, while pre-tax profits nearly quadrupled to £214.3 million
(Nilsson 2022). The brand showed its resilience during the coronavirus crisis, delivering annual
revenue growth of 15 per cent despite the multiple lockdowns that shuttered stores (Davey
2021). With the brand’s intentions to increase its marketing budget, broaden its geographical
reach and strengthen its DTC channel (all while preserving its valuable brand), it appears that
Dr. Martens’ prospects are brighter than ever (Vichev 2022). With a knack for reinvention and a
reputation for quality, no doubt Dr. Martens will be around for a long time to come (Flanagan￾Hunter 2020).

CASE 16
BRAND STRATEGY
CHANGES AT BURBERRY
Reinventing the Brand
It’s called ‘doing a Gucci’ after Domenico De Sole and Tom Ford’s stunning success at turning
nearly bankrupt Gucci Group into a £7 billion (€10 billion) (market capitalization) fashion
powerhouse. Since 1997, when she took over, Rose Marie Bravo’s makeover of the 143-year￾old Burberry brand has followed the same path.
Source: Artur Wave/Shutterstockpage 345
The Burberry story began in 1856 when Thomas Burberry opened his first gentlemen’s
outfitters. By the First World War, business was booming, as Burberry won the contract to
supply trench coats to the British army. Its reputation grew when it proved its contribution to the
national cause. The Burberry check was introduced in the 1920s and became fashionable
among the British middle to upper classes. Later, when it was worn by Humphrey Bogart in
Casablanca and Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, the Burberry trench coat gained
widespread appeal.
Bought by Great Universal Stores in 1955, the brand’s huge popularity from the 1940s to the
1970s had waned by the 1980s. A less deferential society no longer yearned to dress like the
upper classes, and the Burberry brand’s cachet fell in the UK. This was partially offset by a
surge in sales to the newly rich Japanese after they discovered its famous (and trademarked)
tan, black/red and white check pattern. This trend spread across other areas in Southeast Asia
and, by the mid-1990s, this region accounted for an unbalanced 75 per cent of Burberry sales.
British and American consumers began to regard it as an Asian brand and rather staid.
Furthermore, distribution was focused on small shops, with few big fashion chains and
upmarket stores like Harrods stocking the brand. In the US, stores like Barney’s, Neiman
Marcus and Saks only sold Burberry raincoats, not the higher-profit-margin accessories (e.g.
handbags, belts, scarves and wraps).
Change of Strategy
These problems resulted in profit falls in the 1990s culminating in a £37 million (€42 million)
drop in profits to £25 million (€28 million) in 1997. This prompted some serious managerial
rethinking and the recruitment of American Rose Marie Bravo as a new chief executive.
Responsible for the turnaround of the US store chain Saks Fifth Avenue, she had the necessary
experience to make the radical changes required at Burberry.
One of her first moves was to appoint young designer Roberto Menichetti to overhaul the
clothing range. His challenge was to redesign Burberry’s raincoats and other traditional
products, to keep them fresh and attractive to new generations of younger consumers.
Furthermore, he sought to extend the Burberry image to a new range of products. The Burberry
brand name began to appear on such products as children’s clothes, personal products,
watches, blue jeans, bikinis, homeware and shoes, in order to attract new customers and
broaden the company’s sales base. Commenting on Menichetti, Bravo says, ‘Coming in, I had
studied Hermès and Gucci and other great brands, and it struck me that even during the
periods when they had dipped a bit, they never lost the essence of whatever made those
brands sing. And I thought, “This man will retain what’s good and move us forward”.’
Design was further strengthened in 2001 with the appointment of Christopher Bailey (from
Gucci) as Burberry’s creative director. He created Burberry ‘classics with a twist’ (for example,
recasting the classic trench coat in hot pink). Bailey’s job was to design clothes that met
Bravo’s vision of heritage and classic, but at the same time young, modern, hip and
fashionable.
A second element of her strategy was to bring in advertising agency Baron & Baron and
celebrity photographer Mario Testino to shoot ads featuring models Kate Moss and Stella
Tennant. Other celebrities, such as the Beckhams, Callum Best, Elizabeth Jagger, Nicole
Appleton and Jarvis Cocker, also featured in Burberry advertising. The focus was to emphasizethe new credentials of the Burberry brand without casting off its classic roots. Getting key
celebrities to don the Burberry check in its advertising was highly important in achieving this.
Bravo once remarked that the famous picture of Kate Moss in a Burberry check bra cut the
average age of its customers by 30 years.
A third strand in Bravo’s strategy was to sort out distribution. Unprofitable shops were closed
and emphasis placed on flagship stores in cosmopolitan cities. Prestige UK retailers including
Harvey Nichols were selected to stock exclusive ranges. Bravo comments, ‘We were selling in
20 small shops in Knightsbridge alone, but we weren’t in Harrods.’ Also, stores that were selling
only raincoats were persuaded to stock high-margin accessories as well. Burberry accessories
increased from accounting for 20 per cent to 25 per cent of turnover. This was part of a wider
focus on gifts – the more affordable side of luxury that can drive heavy footfall through the
stores. As Bravo says, ‘Burberry has to be thought of as a gift store. Customers have to feel
they can go into Burberry and buy gifts at various price points.’
International expansion was also high on Bravo’s priority list. A succession of new stores were
opened, including flagship stores in London, New York and Barcelona. The New York store on
57th Street was the realization of a personal dream for Bravo, whose vision was to replace the
store the company had been running in Manhattan for almost 25 years with one that was
bigger, better and far more profitable. It is the biggest Burberry store worldwide and has a
number of Burberry ‘firsts’: a lavish gift department, a large area for accessories, private
shopping and an in-store Mad Hatters tearoom. It also offers a service called Art of the Trench,
where customers can get made-to-measure trench coats customized by allowing them to pick
their own lining, collar, checks and tartan. The Barcelona store was regarded as vital in helping
to reposition the Burberry brand in Spain. Prior to its opening, the brand was slightly less
fashionable and sold at slightly lower prices than in the UK. The opening of the Barcelona store
saw the London product being displayed for the first time as Burberry moved towards one
global offering. Besides the US and Spain, Burberry’s third priority country was Japan, since it
was an enormous market for the company already.
The results of this activity were astonishing. Profits soared to £162 million (€183 million) by
2005, a six-fold increase since Bravo took over, and in 2002 Great Universal Stores floated
one-third of Burberry, its subsidiary, on the stock market, raising £275 million (€310 million).
Then, in December 2005, it demerged Burberry completely, allocating Burberry stores to GUS
shareholders in proportion to their holdings in a deal worth £1.4 billion (€1.6 billion).
Burberry did face problems, however. One was the weeding-out of grey-market goods, which
were offered cheaply in Asia only to be diverted back to Western markets at a discount. Not
only were sales affected but also brand image was tarnished. Like Dior before it, Burberry was
willing to spend the necessary money to try to eliminate this activity. Another problem was that
of copycats that infringed its trademark. Burberry claims to spend about £2 million (€2.3 million)
a year fighting counterfeits, running advertisements in trade publications and sending letters to
trade groups, textile manufacturers and retailers reminding them about its trademark rights. It
uses an internet-monitoring service to help pick up online discussions about counterfeits. It also
works with customs officials and local police forces to seize fakes and sue infringers.
The fondness with which so-called ‘chavs’ regarded the Burberry check was a third problem.
One observer defined the chav as a young, white, undereducated underclass, obsessed with
brands and unsuitable jewellery. One product with which chavs became particularly associated
was the Burberry baseball cap. They were also associated with violence, particularly at football
matches. The sight of football hooligans appearing in the media adorned in beige and black
check was not appreciated at Burberry HQ. In response, the company stopped producing the
infamous cap and shifted emphasis to other non-check lines, including its Prorsum line of luxury
clothing designed by creative director Christopher Bailey.page 346
A fourth problem arose in 2005 with the announcement that Bravo had decided to step down as
chief executive. The woman who had built Burberry into an ultra-fashionable major global brand
would need to be replaced. Her successor was Angela Ahrendts, who was recruited from US
clothing company Liz Claiborne. After a period of working together, Ahrendts took the helm in
July 2006 with Bravo taking the newly created role of vice-chairperson, a part-time executive
position.
A New Era
Ahrendts made changes to the Burberry product line by making the check more subtle, and
using it mainly in linings and discreet areas of garments. She also placed greater emphasis on
higher-margin accessories such as handbags and perfumes, and top-of-the-range fashion. She
continued to use British celebrities such as Agyness Deyn and Emma Watson to
represent the brand. Burberry also opened stores in emerging markets such as
China, India, Russia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In 2008, Burberry’s first standalone
children’s wear store in Hong Kong was opened, and in 2011 the company bought out its
Chinese franchise partner in order to tighten its hold on its global image. It also built up its
presence in the US with the opening of its new headquarters in New York and further store
openings.
Ahrendts also improved efficiency by installing new IT systems and replacing 21 scattered
distribution centres with three regional hubs in the US. Her attention was also placed on better
sourcing in an effort to improve margins.
Another major focus was to revive Burberry’s heritage to the digital generation. Where once
luxury brands were reluctant to use the internet, believing it would cheapen their image,
Burberry embraced digital, for example being the first luxury brand to embrace Snapchat to
connect to the next generation of consumers. Now digital represents more than 60 per cent of
the marketing budget. Burberry live-streams seasonal shows online and in stores, allowing
customers to order products for early delivery with a personalized touch, such as an engraved
nameplate in a coat or bag. Pictures of the latest designs are posted on Twitter before they are
released to traditional media. Burberry has more than 40 million Facebook followers, who can
watch most of its catwalk shows live and purchase Burberry products direct from its virtual
store.
Burberry’s digital presence extends to China, where sales have soared. The brand features on
Chinese sites such as Sina Weibo (China’s equivalent to Twitter) and Youku (similar to
YouTube), helping the brand outperform its rivals in the country. Asia now accounts for more
than 45 per cent of Burberry’s revenues.
As well as global and digital expansion, Ahrendts saw menswear and male accessories such as
bags and scarves as key to Burberry’s continuing success. In 2012, its first standalone
menswear store, next to its branch in Knightsbridge, London, was opened. By 2014, menswear
accounted for a quarter of Burberry’s sales.
The expansion of fragrance and beauty products has also driven sales growth. In 2014, its first
dedicated make-up and perfume shop was opened in Covent Garden, London.
Changes at the Top
By 2014, Burberry sales had soared to £2.33 billion (€2.7 billion), with profits of £461 million
(€520 million). However, in the same year, Ahrendts was tempted by an offer to join Apple andpage 347
was succeeded by creative director Christopher Bailey, who had received much of the credit for
the success of Burberry’s digital marketing operations, including streaming its fashion shows
live, and had been named British designer of the year in 2009. His promotion saw him take over
the dual roles as chief executive and creative director. His aims were to continue global
expansion, particularly in Japan where Burberry had underperformed, expansion of its beauty
business, including entering the £26 billion (€29 billion) skincare market in 2015, and to
continue to penetrate the menswear market.
However, in the face of less than impressive financial results and criticism of his ability to
manage two roles, he was replaced as chief executive by Marco Gobbetti in 2017, while taking
on the positions of president and creative director. Gobbetti was hired from Celine, where he
had transformed the ailing brand by making it more exclusive and expensive. The intention was
for them work together but, after nine months, Bailey decided to leave the company.
Gobbetti’s strategy was to move Burberry further upmarket to take on super-luxury exclusive
brands such as Gucci, Dior and Hermès. He gave the example of Burberry polo shirts priced at
£145–£275 (€165–€310), which he believed should be priced 50 per cent higher, to match other
luxury brands. The practice of offering discounts was also discouraged, focusing instead on
growth of products sold at full price. Distribution strategy was reassessed by closing some
smaller stores, such as in US shopping malls, and outlets in department stores, beginning in
the US before doing so in Europe. This was done to assist Burberry to better control its brand
image, while also opening new stores in influential fashion markets such as Dubai. Gobbetti
also placed greater focus on building Burberry’s presence in leather goods and supporting his
new creative director Riccardo Tisci’s contemporary development of heritage products.
In 2021, Gobbetti announced he would be leaving Burberry to return to Italy, where he would
head up rival Salvatore Ferragamo. The announcement was met with a 9 per cent fall in
Burberry’s share price. He was replaced as chief executive by Jonathan Akeroyd, who was
recruited from Milan-based Gianni Versace.

P
rice is the odd one out of the marketing mix, because it is the revenue
earner and is cited as one of the most critical considerations for marketing
managers (De Toni et al. 2021). The price of a product is what the firm
gets back in return for all the effort put into producing and marketing it. The
other three elements of the marketing mix – product, promotion and place –
are costs. Therefore, no matter how good the product, how creative the
promotion or how efficient the distribution, unless price covers costs the firmwill make a loss. Marketing managers need to understand how to set prices,
because both undercharging (lost margin) and overcharging (lost sales) can
have dramatic effects on profitability.
The obvious way of adding value to an offering is to cut price. However,
this can be a dangerous tactic since it can lead to price wars and can damage
perceptions of the brand. In this chapter, we will consider how pricing can be
used as a strategic weapon to achieve corporate and brand objectives without
necessarily cutting price.
One of the key factors marketing managers need to remember is price is
just one element of the marketing mix. Price should not be set in isolation; it
should be aligned with product, promotion and place to form a coherent mix to
provide superior customer value. The sales of many products, particularly
those that are a form of self-expression – such as drinks, cars, perfume and
clothing – could suffer from prices that are too low. As we shall see, price is an
important part of positioning strategy, since it often sends quality cues to
customers.
Since price is a major determinant of profitability, developing a coherent
pricing strategy assumes major significance, and understanding how to set
prices is an important aspect of marketing decision-making because forces in
the marketing environment can put pressure on costs and subsequently profits,
which ultimately affect long-term business stability. It is also important to
recognize the context in which prices are set. In this chapter we consider both
new and existing products and services.
Marketing in Action 9.1 explains the impact of forces in the marketing
environment on energy firms in Europe.
MARKETING IN ACTION 9.1
Energy Firms Collapse as the Wholesale Price of Gas
and Electricity Heats Up
Key market environment trends are reshaping energy markets in Europe:
Growth in demand is predicted to increase annually for at least the next decade,
responding to the build-up towards electrification of transport, homes and businesses.
Switching of fuel types from oil and diesel to cleaner and renewable power.
Production uncertainty: renewable energy supplies (wind, solar) can be unpredictable,
and the rate of development in the production capabilities of renewables in Europe ispage 351
uncertain due to project delays, government restrictions and funding.
Phasing out of coal and decommissioning of nuclear plants: Europe’s capacity for
conventional and more stable energy production is in decline.
Liberalization of energy markets in Europe aimed to facilitate better market coordination,
deliver more efficient provision of energy supplies and to allow competitive forces to
drive down prices to consumers. The liberalization of energy generation, transmission
and distribution occurred across the European Union, laid the foundations for
establishing a European energy market and succeeded in increasing competition in
retail markets.
Changing energy market landscape: this is complex and, recently, price volatility in
wholesale gas markets has increased due to cold winter weather, high demand, low
supply, issues with major producers, while the conflict between Russia (a major gas
supplier) and Ukraine has pushed up global prices to unprecedented levels.
Political interventions: in the UK, for example, energy regulator Ofgem capped
consumer bills, meaning the price energy firms charge customers is controlled, and
limits are set for units of energy and associated standing charges. The UK’s Chancellor
of the Exchequer introduced some support packages to help households cope with
rising energy prices, seeking to ensure they pay ‘fair’ prices.

A crisis across the energy industry, brought about by these trends, has caused the collapse
of many energy suppliers across Europe, which were established during liberalization of the
industry and founded to set prices based on affordability to the consumer. Those that have
ceased trading include Enstroga (Netherlands and UK), Bohemia Energy (Czech Republic),
GoTo Energy, Bulb Energy and Zog Energy (UK), Optima and Neckermann Strom AG
(Germany).
This illustrates how external, uncontrollable forces can impact on firms, and highlights the
pressures on pricing, and its relation to business collapse and/or long-term sustainability.

Samseth et al. (2021)Why an Economist’s Approach to
Pricing is Important
Pricing decisions are important for both economists and marketers as price
determines individual, firm, industry and economy growth or decline. For the
economist, there is an assumption that buyers behave rationally, and this means
stable and consistent decision-making based on analysis of various factors,
which leads to the purchase of the best and most economically viable option.
Economists talk of the demand curve, to conceptualize the relationship
between the quantity demanded and different price levels. Figure 9.1 shows a
typical demand curve.
FIGURE 9.1
The demand curve
Looking at Figure 9.1, at a price of P1
, demand is Q1
. As price drops, so
demand rises. Thus at P2
, demand increases to Q2
. For some products, a given
fall in price leads to a large increase in demand. The demand for such products
is said to be price elastic. For other products, a given fall in price leads to only
a small increase in demand. The demand for these products is described as
price inelastic. Clearly it is useful to know the price elasticity of demand.
When faced with elastic demand, marketers know a price drop may stimulatemuch greater demand for their products. Conversely, when faced with inelastic
demand, marketers know a price drop will not increase demand appreciably.
For marketers there is no one demand curve relating price to demand in
real life, as in this case there is a lack of perfect rationality, particularly in
relation to consumer decision-making (Skouras et al. 2005). Each demand
curve is based on a set of assumptions regarding other factors, such as
advertising expenditure, sales force effectiveness, distribution intensity and the
price of competing products, which also affect demand. For the purposes of
Figure 9.1, these have been held constant at a level that permits one unique
curve to be plotted. Another problem for marketers is the estimation of the
position of the curve even when other influences are held constant. Some firms
conduct experiments to estimate likely demand at various price levels.
However, it is not always feasible to conduct experiments, since companies
may rely on the cooperation of retailers, who may refuse, or may demand
unrealistically high fees. Third, it is very difficult to implement a fully
controlled field experiment. Where different regions of a country are involved,
differences in income levels, variations in local tastes and preferences, and
differences in levels of competitor activity may confound the results. The
reality is, while the demand curve is a useful conceptual tool for thinking about
pricing issues, in practice its application is limited. In truth, traditional
economic theory is a complex area of study beyond the scope of this chapter,
but it is important to understand it provides an explanation of market
behaviour, and the concepts of supply and demand reflect general levels of
pricing and consumption.
Shapiro and Jackson (1978) identified three methods used by managers to
set prices (see Figure 9.2):
1. cost-orientated pricing, which focuses on internal costs
2. competitor-orientated pricing, which reflects competitive behaviour pricing
3. customer-orientated pricing, which focuses on market influences and the
value customers place on a product in the marketplace (Ingenbleek et al.
2010).
FIGURE 9.2
Pricing methodspage 352
A fourth set of approaches is dynamic pricing, widely used in service
industries and online. This approach refers to the continuous adjustment of
prices based on demand (Talón-Ballestero et al. 2022). Dynamic pricing
approaches have become more widely used as technology solutions and the
processing of big data have opened up opportunities for organizations to
reduce uncertainties (Chen et al. 2012).
We now examine these approaches and draw out their strengths and
limitations.page 353
Cost-orientated Pricing
Firms use cost-orientated methods when setting prices (Jobber and Hooley
1987). Two methods are normally used: full-cost pricing and direct-cost (or
marginal-cost) pricing. Pricing and its relationship to costs are central to a
firm’s business strategy and although often criticized for losing sight of
customers and the value they seek, controlling costs and prices is very valuable
when it comes to planning, control, investment decisions and long-term
profitability (Mattos et al. 2021).
Full-cost pricing
Full-cost pricing can best be explained by using a simple example (see Table
9.1). Imagine you have to determine pricing for a new product (a smart light
bulb) and the cost figures given in Table 9.1 apply. Direct costs such as labour
and materials work out at £10 per unit. As output increases, more people and
materials will be needed, and so total costs increase. Fixed costs (or
overheads) per year are calculated at £1,000,000. These costs (such
as office and manufacturing facilities) do not change as output increases. They
must be paid whether 10 or 1 million light bulbs are produced.
TABLE 9.1 Full-cost pricing
The next step is to estimate how many smart light bulbs cards we are likely
to sell. The estimate for the new bulb sales is 100,000 in year 1. Therefore,total (full) cost per unit is £20 and, using the firm’s traditional 10 per cent
mark-up, a price of £22 is set.
To appreciate the problem of using full-cost pricing, let us assume the sales
estimate of 100,000 is not reached by the end of the year. Poor economic
conditions or setting the price too high means only 50,000 units are sold. The
firm believes this level of sales is likely to be achieved again in year 2. What
happens to price? Table 9.1 shows the price is raised, because the cost per unit
has increased. This is because fixed costs (£1,000,000) are divided by a
smaller expected sales volume (50,000). The result is a price rise in response to
poor sales figures. This is clearly nonsense and yet can happen if full-cost
pricing is followed explicitly.
The problem with full-cost pricing is it leads to an increase in price as sales
fall. The approach is illogical, because a sales estimate is made before a price
is set. Also it focuses on internal costs rather than customers’ willingness to
pay. However, since the method forces managers to calculate costs, it does
give an indication of the minimum price necessary to make a profit. Once
direct and fixed costs have been measured, break-even analysis can be used to
estimate the sales volume needed to balance revenue and costs at different
price levels. Therefore, the procedure of calculating full costs is useful when
other pricing methods are used, since full costs may act as a constraint. If full
costs cannot be covered, then it may not be worthwhile launching the product.
Direct-cost pricing
In certain circumstances, firms may use direct-cost pricing (sometimes called
marginal cost pricing). This involves the calculation of only those costs likely
to rise as output increases. In Table 9.1, direct cost per unit is £10. As output
increases, so total costs will increase by £10 per unit. Like full-cost pricing,
direct-cost pricing includes a mark-up (in this case 10 per cent) giving a price
of £11.
The problem here is this price does not cover full costs, and so the firm
would be making a loss selling a product at this low price. However, there are
situations where selling at a price above direct costs but below full cost makes
sense. Suppose a firm is operating below capacity and the sales director
receives a call from a buyer who is willing to place an order for 50,000 smart
light bulbs but will pay only £11 per unit. If, in management’s judgement, to
refuse the order would mean machinery lying idle, a strong case for accepting
the order can be made since the £1 per unit (£50,000) over direct costs ispage 354
contributing to fixed costs and would not be made if the order were turned
down. The decision is not without risk – customers who are paying a higher
price may become aware of the £11 price and demand a similar deal.
Direct costs indicate the lowest price at which it is sensible to take business
if the alternative is to let machinery (or seats or rooms) lie idle. Also, direct￾cost pricing does not suffer from the ‘price up as demand down’ problem
found with full-cost pricing, as it does not take account of fixed costs in the
price calculation. Finally, it avoids the problem of allocating
overhead charges that is found with full-cost pricing, for the same
reason. However, when business is buoyant, it gives no indication of the
correct price, because it does not take into account customers’ willingness to
pay. Nor can it be used in the long term as, at some point, fixed costs must be
covered to make a profit. Nevertheless, as a short-term expedient or tactical
device, direct-cost pricing does have a role to play in reducing the impact of
excess capacity.
Competitor-orientated Pricing
A second approach to pricing is to focus on competitors rather than costs when
setting prices. Pricing plays a very important role in communicating with
customers and can be central to a competitive strategy (Indounas and Avlonitis
2011). Competitive pricing looks at the prices in the marketplace, focusing on
relevant competitors, comparing prices and evaluating the offer to the
customer (Pohland and Kesgin 2017). Methods include: going-rate pricing
and competitive bidding.
Going-rate pricing
In situations where there is little product differentiation – for example, in a
commodity market when selling a certain grade of coffee bean – a producer
may have to take the going rate for the product. A fundamental marketing
principle is the creation of a differential advantage, which enables companies
to build monopoly positions around their products. This allows a degree of
price discretion dependent upon how much customers value the differential
advantage. Even in what appear to be commodity markets, creative thinking
can lead to the formation of a differential advantage on which a premium pricecan be built. A case in point was Austin Trumanns, a steel stockholder, which
stocked the same kind of basic steels held by many other stockholders. Faced
with a commodity product, Austin Trumanns attempted to differentiate on
delivery. It guaranteed it would deliver on time or pay back 10 per cent of the
price to the buyer. So important was delivery to buyers (and so unreliable were
many of Austin Trumanns’ rivals) buyers were willing to pay a 5 per cent price
premium for this guarantee. The result was Austin Trumanns was consistently
the most profitable firm in its sector for many years. This example shows how
companies can use the creation of a differential advantage to set prices higher
than the going rate set in the marketplace.
Competitive bidding
Many contracts are won or lost based on competitive bidding. The process
involves the drawing up of detailed specifications for a product and putting the
contract out to tender. Potential suppliers each quote a price confidentially to a
buyer (sealed bids). All other things being equal, the buyer will select the
supplier quoting the lowest price. A major focus for suppliers, therefore, is the
likely bid prices of competitors. Statistical models have been developed by
management scientists to add a little science to the art of competitive bidding
(Edelman 1965). Most use the concept of expected profit, where:
Expected profit is clearly a notional figure based on actual profit (bid price
– costs) and the probability of the bid price being successful.
Table 9.2 gives a simple example of how such a competitive bidding model
might be used. Based on past experience, the bidder believes the successful bid
will fall in the range of £2,000–£2,500. As price is increased, so profits will
rise (full costs = £2,000) and the probability of winning will fall. The bidder
uses past experience to estimate the probability of each price level being
successful. In this example, the probability ranges from 0.10 to 0.99. By
multiplying profit and probability, an expected profit figure can be calculated
for each bid price. Expected profit peaks at £160, which corresponds to a bid
price of £2,200. Consequently, this is the price at which the bid will be made.
TABLE 9.2 Competitive bidding using the expected profit criterionpage 355
*Based on the expected profit criterion, the recommended bid price is £2,200.
Unfortunately, this simple model suffers from a number of limitations.
First, it may be difficult, if not impossible, for managers to express in precise
statistical probability terms their views on the likelihood of a price being
successful. Note if the probability of the £2,200 bid were recorded as 0.70
rather than 0.80, and likewise the £2,300 bid were recorded as 0.50 rather than
0.40, the recommended bid price would move from £2,200 (expected profit
£140) to £2,300 (expected profit £150). Clearly the outcome of the analysis
can be dependent on small changes in the probability figures.
Second, use of the expected profit criterion is limited to situations
where the bidder can play the percentage game over the medium to long term.
In circumstances where firms are desperate to win an order, they may decide to
trade off profit for an improved chance of winning. In the extreme case of a
company fighting for survival, a more sensible bid strategy might be to price at
below full cost (£2,000) and simply contribute to fixed costs.
Competitive bidding is used by firms and government departments for
contracting large-scale and long-term trading agreements. Computacentre is an
independent technology firm that provides IT solutions to many large
corporate and public-sector organizations. The firm’s strategy is to source and
manage technology infrastructure, and support organizations to achieve digital
transformation. These elements of strategy are used when bidding for contracts
to differentiate the firm from its competitors, and it has been successful in
many bids, securing long-term contracts with many different organizations
(e.g. the Civil Aviation Authority, Kellogg’s, HUK-COBURG, Yorkshire
Building Society) (Computacenter 2022).
Customer-orientated PricingCustomer-orientated pricing is considered by many marketing academics
and practitioners as the best way to determine pricing strategies. The reason is
prices are set based on how the customer values a product or service. Value￾based pricing sets a price for goods and services based on benefits to the user
and their willingness to pay. This method of pricing focuses on the customer,
rather than on costs and competitors (Ingenbleek et al. 2003; Liozu 2017).
Customer value-based pricing approaches
As a way to improve profitability and long-term success, many varied firms,
from pharmaceutical product manufacturer Sanofi and software producer SAP
to vehicle manufacturer BMW, use this approach (Hinterhuber 2008). A key
marketing consideration when setting prices is to estimate a product’s value to
the customer. The more value a product gives compared with the competition,
the higher the price that can be charged. Value-based pricing is widely used by
fashion brands, where consumers perceive high psychological value and raised
personal status (see Exhibit 9.1).
EXHIBIT 9.1

the potential to deliver high psychological value to some customers

In this section, we explore several ways of estimating value to the
customer. Estimating value is critical because of the close relationship between
value and price. Three methods of estimating value will now be discussed:
trade-off analysis, experimentation and analysis of economic value to the
customer.page 356
Trade-off analysis
Trade-off analysis (otherwise known as conjoint analysis) measures the trade￾off between price and other product features so their effects on product
preference can be established (Kucher and Simon 1987).
Respondents are not asked direct questions about price; instead
product profiles consisting of product features and price are described and
respondents are asked to name their preferred profile. From their answers, the
effect of price and other product features can be measured using a computer
model. The following is a brief description of the procedure.
The first step is to identify the most important product features (attributes)
and the benefits expected to be gained as a result of buying the product.
Product profiles are then built using these attributes (including price) and
respondents are asked to choose which product they would buy from pairs of
product profiles. Statistical analysis allows the computation of preference
contributions that permit the preference for attributes to be compared. For
example, if the analysis was for a business-to-business product, trade-off
analysis might show improving delivery time from one week to one day is
worth a price increase of 5 per cent. In addition, the relative importance of
each of the product attributes, including price, can be calculated. By translating
these results into market share and profit figures for the proposed new product
the optimal price can be found.
This technique has been used to price a wide range of industrial and
consumer products and services, and can be used to answer such questions as
the following (Cattin and Wittink 1989):
What is the value of a product feature, including improving service levels, in
price terms?
What happens to market share if price changes?
What is the value of a brand name in terms of price?
Growing demand for goods and services globally, considered alongside
pollution, global warming, depletion of natural resources and loss of
biodiversity, is an area where trade-off analysis often occurs. Consumers often
balance their desire for new products against the impact on the planet.
Commercial buyers also consider the wider impacts of the products and
services they buy to use in manufacturing and reselling, in conjunction with
reviewing the attitudes and preferences of their target markets. The circular
economy concept, which focuses on reusing materials, recycling and
redesigning products to have longer lives, affects the nature of goods andservices available (Hartley et al. 2020). Trade-offs in this context highlight
gaps between attitudes and behaviours. Part of the issue is the complexity of
buying behaviour when making final purchase choice. Price may act as a
deterrent or as an incentive for products and services with green attributes, as it
depends on the buyer’s willingness to recognize they may have to pay a
premium price for what they may deem to be a low-value product. For
example, sustainable fashion products may be perceived as expensive and
lacking brand image when compared with other fashion brands. The trade-off
then becomes between paying the price to be green (or not green), supporting a
circular economy (or not) (Testa et al. 2022). Now read Hidden Gem 9.1 to
find out how IKEA is joining the circular economy with its Buyback & Resell
service.
HIDDEN GEM 9.1
IKEA Joins the Circular Economy With Its Buyback &
Resell Service
IKEA has sold more than 60 million Billy bookcases since 1979 when Gillis Lundgren
designed the iconic shelving system. Prices vary around the world: in Egypt the standard
model is $100, whereas in Slovakia the price is just $40. A new bookcase is produced every
three seconds, largely by robots in the Gyllensvaans Möbler factory in Sweden, which
keeps prices low. To keep pace with production, hundreds of tonnes of particle board
laminated with plastic arrive at the factory daily.

But the popularity of this furniture item (as with other low-cost items) is becoming a problem
for IKEA. A survey revealed over a third of first-time property buyers and renters admitted to
throwing away cheap furniture, which could have been resold or repurposed. Furthermore,
during 2020/2021, as locked-down populations stared at their walls, ‘pandemic makeovers’
boosted the home improvement industry, but there was a spike in the amount of fly-tipping
of furniture items reported by local councils across Britain. This brought the ‘fast furniture’
industry into the environmental spotlight. Previously, a study of furniture
retailers by conservation charity WWF had raised the alarm, finding 68 per cent
didn’t have sufficiently good policies for timber sourcing. Furniture price wars have
encouraged practices that focus on production costs and do not factor in the wider impact
on the planet.
IKEA has sales of €41.3 billion, which places it at the top of global furniture sales, but the
firm has long been aware of the importance of sustainability of its production: in the early
days of the company, in 1979, founder Ingvar Kamprad is quoted as telling his employees
‘wasting is a mortal sin’. The firm’s strategy on climate, People & Planet Positive, has set
goals to make all of its products recyclable and made for renewables by 2030. But the
efforts to make this happen don’t end there.
IKEA has introduced a new service it hopes will contribute to its approach towards the
circular economy: its Buyback & Resell service. Products such as chairs, shelves and
bedroom furniture can be returned to an IKEA store in return for credits, which are
calculated by the Buyback Estimator tool online. Via this tool, the ‘reseller’ provides product
details and states the condition of the item and, if it is accepted, is given a buyback price
(up to 50 per cent of the original purchase price). The item of furniture is then returned to
the nearest IKEA store, where it is reviewed by an IKEA co-worker and the reseller receives
an IKEA refund card to the agreed value.
Returned items are then resold in IKEA’s Circular Hub (in-store) or can be reserved via
online classified ads site Gumtree, enabling new buyers to purchase items at much lower
prices. The scheme was launched in May 2021, and in Scotland more than 10,000 items
were returned to the store in the first month after the launch of the scheme.
In this way, IKEA is making a positive commitment to taking circular consumption
mainstream, with its retail manager for the UK and Ireland quoted as saying ‘We recognize
our unique opportunity to help lead the change.’

Experimentation
A limitation of trade-off analysis is respondents are not asked to back up their
preferences with cash expenditure. Consequently, what they say they prefer
may not be reflected in actual purchase when they are asked to part with their
money. Experimental pricing research attempts to overcome this drawback by
placing a product on sale at different locations, with varying prices.page 358
The major alternatives are to use a controlled store experiment or test
marketing. In a controlled store experiment, a number of stores are paid to vary
the price levels of the product under test. Suppose 100 supermarkets are being
used to test two price levels of a brand of coffee; 50 stores would be chosen at
random (perhaps after controlling for region and size) and allocated the lower
price; the rest would use the higher price. By comparing sales levels and profit
contributions between the two groups of stores, the most profitable price
would be established. A variant of this procedure is to test price differences
between the test brand and major rival brands. For example, in half the stores a
price differential of 2p may be compared with one of 4p. In practice,
considerable sums need to be paid to supermarkets to obtain approval to run
such tests, and the implementation of the price levels needs to be monitored
carefully to ensure the stores do sell at the specified prices.
Test marketing can be used to compare the effectiveness of varying prices
as long as more than one area is chosen. For example, the same product could
be sold in two areas using an identical promotional campaign but with
different prices between areas. A more sophisticated design could measure the
four combinations of high/low price and high/low promotional expenditure if
four areas were chosen. Obviously, the areas would need to be matched (or
differences allowed for) in terms of target customer profile so the result would
be comparable. The test needs to be long enough to enable trial and repeat
purchase at each price to be measured. This is likely to be between 6 and 12
months for products whose purchase cycle lasts more than a few weeks.
A potential problem of using test marketing to measure price effects is
competitor activity designed to invalidate the test results. For example,
competitors could run special promotions in the test areas to make sales levels
atypical if they discovered the purpose and location of the test marketing
activities. Alternatively, they might decide not to react at all. If they know a
pricing experiment is taking place and syndicated consumer panel
data are being used to measure the results, they may simply
monitor the results since competitors will be receiving the same data as the
testing firm (Moutinho and Evans 1992). By estimating how successful each
price has been, they are in a good position to know how to react when a price
is set nationally.
Analysis of economic value to the customerExperimentation is more usual when pricing consumer products. Economic
value to the customer (EVC) analysis is widely used in industrial markets.
Many organizational purchases are motivated by economic value
considerations, since reducing costs and increasing revenue are prime
objectives. If a firm can produce an offering with a high EVC, it can set a high
price and yet still offer superior value compared with the competition.
Calculating EVC involves determining the tangible value of a product or
service and adding the intangible value a product provides to the user. For
example, in the case of Evian bottled water, its tangible value is based on the
product’s ability to quench thirst, but it also has therapeutic qualities as it is a
mineral water, so its intangible value comes from the brand’s heritage,
associations, sponsorship of sporting events, and celebrity endorsements (e.g.
Evian is the official water of the Wimbledon tennis championship, and is
endorsed by celebrities Gigi Hadid (model) and Serena Williams (tennis
player). These values to the customer allow Evian to price its bottled water
higher than its competitors (see Exhibit 9.2).
EXHIBIT 9.2

Figure 9.3 illustrates the calculation of EVC and how it can be used in
price setting. A reference product is chosen (often the market leader) with
which to compare costs. In the example in Figure 9.3, the market leader is
selling a machine tool for £50,000. However, this is only part of a customer’s
lifecycle costs. In addition, £30,000 start-up costs (installation, lost production
and operator training) and £120,000 post-purchase costs (operator, power and
maintenance) are incurred. The total lifecycle costs are, therefore, £200,000.page 359
FIGURE 9.3
Pricing using economic value to the customer (EVC) analysis
A new machine tool (product X) has a different customer cost profile.
Technological advances have reduced start-up costs to £20,000 and post￾purchase costs to £100,000. Therefore, total costs are reduced by £30,000 and
the EVC our new product offers is £80,000 (£200,000 – £120,000). Thus, the
EVC figure is the amount a customer would have to pay to make the total
lifecycle costs of the new and reference products the same. If the new machine
tool were priced at £80,000, this would be the case. Below this price there
would be an economic incentive for customers to buy the new machine tool.
EVC analysis is clearly a powerful tool for price setting, as it establishes
the upper economic limit for price. Management must then use judgement
regarding how much incentive to give the customer to buy the new product
and how much of a price premium to charge. A price of £60,000 would give
customers a £20,000 lifetime cost saving incentive, while establishing a
£10,000 price premium over the reference product. In general, the more
entrenched the market leader, the more loyal its customer base and the lesswell known the newcomer, the higher the cost saving incentive needs to be. In
the second example shown in Figure 9.3, the new machine tool (product Y)
does not affect costs but raises the customer’s revenues. For example, faster
operation may result in more output, or greater precision may enhance product
quality, leading to higher prices. This product is estimated to give £40,000
extra profit contribution over the reference product, because of higher
revenues. Its EVC is, therefore, £90,000, indicating the highest price the
customer should be willing to pay. Again, marketing management must decide
how much incentive to give to customers and how much of a price premium to
charge.
EVC analysis can be useful in target market selection, since different
customers may have varying EVC levels. A decision may be made to target the
market segment with the highest EVC figure, since for these customers the
product has the greatest differential advantage. The implementation of an
EVC-based pricing strategy relies on a well-trained sales force capable of
explaining sophisticated economic value calculations to customers, and field￾based evidence that the estimates of cost savings and revenue increases will
occur in practice.
Influences on customer value-based pricing
approaches
Customer value-based pricing is more difficult to determine than cost and
competitor orientated pricing, as it takes into account a much wider range of
factors. Value-based factors to consider when adopting a customer-orientated
approach are shown in Figure 9.4.

Price–quality relationships
The relationship between price and perceived quality is used by many people
as an indicator of quality. This is particularly the case for products where an
objective measurement of quality is not possible, such as alcohol, fragrances,
accommodation and restaurants. But the effect is also to be found with
consumer durables and industrial products.
Analysis of customer perceptions of price and quality is complex. The
perceived value scale (PERVAL) devised by Sweeney and Soutar (2001)
brings together price and quality and adds emotional and social value (see
Table 9.3). This scale has been widely researched in different marketing
contexts – mobile technology (Lee et al. 2002), financial services (Sánchez et
al. 2006), tourism (Grace and Weaven 2011), private-label brands (Walsh and
Mitchell 2010) and home furnishings (Walsh et al. 2014) – and
has been found to be a valid approach. The scale provides a
rounded and structured method for consideration of consumers’ perception of
value in relation to price.

cost, time and effort required to buy the product or service

Mini Case 9.1 discusses the results of experiments conducted to investigate
the influence of price on quality perceptions. A potential problem, therefore, is
by charging a low price brand image may be tarnished.
MINI CASE 9.1
Does Price Really Influence Perceptions of Quality?
Source: (l)AllaBond/Shutterstock, (r)Carlo Prearo/Shutterstock
The question of the influence of price on quality perceptions has interested marketing
managers for decades. Two experiments have investigated this issue. The first was a study
into the effect of the price of placebos (dummy pills) on the killing of pain. Both pills were
identical (a sugar compound), but patients who took the $2.50 placebo judged it better at
killing pain than those who took one costing only 10 cents.
In the second experiment, 20 occasional red wine drinkers were asked to taste one
Cabernet Sauvignon marked with a $5 price tag and another with a $45 price tag. However,
both came from the same $5 bottle. The higher-priced wine was selected as tasting superior
by most of the drinkers. To explain the results, neuroscience was called upon. In a second
experiment, the drinkers were asked to drink again while wired up to a brain scanner. Whenpage 361
they drank the ‘more expensive’ wine, the part of the brain associated with pleasure became
more active than when the ‘less expensive’ wine was drunk. Clearly, the higher price caused
the drinkers to experience more pleasure, even if the product itself was no different.

the tangible and intangible benefits.
2. Explain when price does matter.

against competitors selling higher-priced goods? Use further examples to justify your
argument.

Costs and negotiating margins
Those setting prices should consider costs even when taking a customer￾orientated approach. The secret is to consider costs alongside all the other
considerations discussed under customer-orientated price setting rather than in
isolation. In this way, costs act as a constraint: if the market will not bear the
full cost of producing and marketing the product, it should not be launched.
What should be avoided is the blind reference to costs when setting prices.
Simply because one product costs less to make than another, this does not
imply its price should be lower.
In some markets, customers expect a price reduction. The price paid is
therefore very different from the list price. In the car market, for example,
customers expect to pay less than the asking price. For organizational
customers, Marn and Rosiello (1992) described the difference between list
price and realized or transaction price as the price waterfall. The difference
can be accounted for by order-size discounts, competitive discounts (a
discretionary discount negotiated before the order is taken), a fast payment
discount, an annual volume bonus and promotional allowances. Managing this
price waterfall is a key element in achieving a satisfactory transaction price.
Market-orientated companies recognize such discounting may be a fact ofcommercial life, and build in negotiating margins that allow prices to fall from
list price levels but still permit profitable transaction prices to be achieved.
Big data and digital tools are enabling firms to use advanced analytical
programs to optimize prices using the price waterfall concept. Many e￾commerce sites use algorithms to dynamically calculate and present product
pricing (see the section on dynamic pricing later in this chapter) (Senczyna and
Nemec 2021).
When negotiating prices, firms should ensure they do not engage in price
discrimination, which occurs when a supplier offers a better price for the same
product to one buyer and not to another, resulting in an unfair competitive
advantage. Price discrimination can be justified when the cost of supplying
different customers varies, where the price differences reflect differences in the
level of competition, and where different volumes are purchased. These factors
are often considered during negotiation.
Distribution
When products are sold through intermediaries such as distributors or retailers,
the list price to the customer must reflect the margins required by
intermediaries. When Müller yoghurt was first launched in the UK, a major
factor in gaining distribution in a mature market was the fact its high price
allowed attractive profit margins for the supermarket chains. Conversely, the
implementation of a penetration pricing strategy (see below) may be hampered
if distributors refuse to stock the product because the profit per unit sold is less
than for competitive products.
The implication is the pricing strategy is dependent on understanding not
only the ultimate customer but also the needs of the distributors and retailers
forming the link between the customer and the manufacturer. If distributors’
and retailers’ needs cannot be accommodated, product launch may not be
viable or a different distribution system (e.g. direct selling) may be required.
Competition
Competition factors are important determinants of price and considered as part
of value-based pricing approaches. At the very least, competitive prices should
be considered, yet it is a fact of commercial life that many firms do not know
what the competition is charging for its products. Care has to be taken when
defining competition. When asked to name competitors, many marketingmanagers list companies supplying technically similar products. For example,
a paint manufacturer will name other paint manufacturers. However, as Figure
9.5 illustrates, this is only one layer of competition. A second layer consists of
dissimilar products solving the same problem in a similar way. Polyurethane
varnish manufacturers would fall into this category. A third level of
competition would come from products solving the problem (or eliminating it)
in a dissimilar way. Since window frames are often painted, PVC double
glazing manufacturers would form competition at this level.
FIGURE 9.5
Layers of competition
This analysis is not simply academic, as the effects of price changes can be
misleading if these three layers of competition are not taken into consideration.
For example, if all paint manufacturers raised their prices simultaneously, they
might believe overall sales would not be dramatically affected if they
mistakenly defined the competition as technically similar products. The reality
is, however, such price collusion would make polyurethane varnish and, over a
longer period, PVC double glazing more attractive to customers.page 362
Branding and tactical marketing
Branding and tactical marketing (deployment of elements of the marketing
mix) is used to differentiate products’ and firms’ investment in giving brands
special meaning for their target customers. The greater the level of
differentiation, the higher the price a brand may charge as enhancing brand
marketing creates value for the customer (Herremans et al. 2000). Louis
Vuitton, Gucci, Hermès and Armani sell fashion goods in luxury consumer
goods markets, a sector that continues to grow globally. To maintain their
position in the market, these and similar brands need to constantly refresh their
marketing efforts in order to be perceived positively by consumers so they can
continue to sell goods at high prices. Luxury brands use tactical marketing to
create a position of exclusivity and scarcity. They must take care if they
consider extending their brand offer to include lower-priced ranges as this
could damage consumer perceptions of the price and quality of the brand, and
negatively affect brand loyalty (Royo-Vela and Sanchez 2022).
Effective investment in branding and tactical marketing has cost
implications that should be considered as part of the pricing strategy. Market
research will need to be conducted to determine customer needs and identify
how a brand’s marketing could be enhanced to add value. Read Marketing in
Action 9.2 to find out more about the allure of charm pricing.
MARKETING IN ACTION 9.2
How to Charm Customers With Psychological Pricing
Pricing is used strategically to meet business and marketing strategy goals, but it is also
used tactically to persuade customers to make a purchase. So why, when an item is tagged
with a sale price of £2.99, €4.99 or $9.99, are some of us more inclined to be nudged
towards making a purchase decision? Psychological pricing appeals to our subconscious
minds and can encourage us to act. Examples of this type of pricing tactic are:
Price anchoring: research has shown consumers depend on initial price information. A
designer watch may be quoted as costing £15,000 (anchor price); a potential customer
is then shown watches at £12,000 and £9,000, which can then be perceived as good
value compared to the anchor price.Charm pricing: this refers to those prices ending in a 9, as mentioned above. Research
has shown a price of €5.99 returns more sales than if an item is priced at €6.00, just one
cent more. The mind subconsciously rounds down the price to $5.00. Prices ending in 5
and 9 are used in 50–90 per cent of food retailing; they are also used in the travel
industry. However, in luxury goods markets, prices ending in 9 are rare. Nevertheless,
this tactic has been found to produce 24 per cent more sales than using rounded prices.
Odd–even pricing is similar: odd numbers at the end of a price tend to be more effective
in suggesting there is a bargain or a deal. Nike, for example, uses even pricing for its
full-price products and odd pricing for its sale ranges. Hillen (2021) found Amazon Fresh
also uses psychological pricing, with more than 70 per cent of all prices ending in a 9.
This is interesting as previous research has suggested this tactic works best when
limited product information is available, while in this case online shoppers have access
to a great deal of information, including price comparison tools and product reviews, so
the tactic of using prices ending in 9 might be expected to be less prevalent.
Decoy pricing: by offering three options but making one look superior (or inferior) value,
customers tend to select or reject from the two most attractive/unattractive offers. For
example, The Economist magazine has promotions on its subscription packages as
follows:
Monthly (digital only) – £10 for one month then £18.90 for each subsequent month,
cost for a year £217.90
Annual (digital only) – £94.50 (year one)
Monthly (digital and print) – £15 for one month, then £23.90 for each subsequent
month, cost for a year £277.90.

Political factorspage 363
page 364
High prices can be a contentious public issue and may invoke government
intervention. Where price is out of line with manufacturing costs, political
pressure may act to force down prices. In the UK, the Competition and
Markets Authority (CMA) is the regulatory body responsible for ensuring
business competition and controlling anticompetitive practices. In the EU, this
responsibility sits with the European Commission in Brussels. The CMA (UK)
investigated the pricing of replica football kits sold in the UK and
provisionally found Elite Sports, JD Sports and Rangers Football Club had
contravened competition law by fixing retail prices for branded clothing
products (UK Government 2022).
Some of the world’s largest consumer products companies, including
Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Gillette and Reckitt Benckiser, were fined a
combined €951 million by the French competition authorities for price fixing
in supermarkets (Kollewe 2014).
Opponents of price fixing claim it is unethical because it restrains the
consumer’s freedom of choice and interferes with each firm’s interest in
offering high-quality products at the best price. Proponents argue that, under
harsh economic conditions, price fixing is necessary to ensure a fair profit for
the industry, and to avoid price wars that might lead to bankruptcies and
unemployment.
Nevertheless, firms should take care to ensure their pricing strategies are
not seen to be against the public interest. For example, in the UK, sharp
increases in energy prices in 2022 have brought much adverse publicity and
threats from politicians to curb further increases. Ofcom, the independent
regulator for the UK communications industries, provides advice
to help consumers and businesses make informed choices when
selecting communication products. Exploitation of a monopoly position or
collusion between firms may bring short-term profits but may also incur the
backlash of a public inquiry into pricing practices.
Dynamic PricingTechnology is having a major impact on prices. First, the internet has spawned
price-comparison sites such as Kelkoo and PriceRunner, allowing consumers,
at the click of a button, to check prices and find bargains. Before the internet,
consumers often needed to spend time and money searching retail outlets for
the best offers. Auction sites, the most successful of which is eBay, have
allowed the creation of virtual marketplaces where sellers and buyers can trade
products and arrive at prices by automated competitive bidding. Innovations in
digital technology and access to large data sources are creating opportunities
for innovative forms of dynamic pricing, which can create value for firms and
their customers. In digital environments, while price (in its most traditional
static sense) remains a significant predictor of firm performance (Dutta et al.
2003), dynamic pricing is at the core of many highly successful online brands,
for example Uber (surge pricing), Amazon (subscription and dynamic pricing)
and Google Ads (real-time pricing) (Nunan and Di Donmenico 2022).
Another aspect of dynamic pricing is buyer participation in setting prices.
Name your own price (where customers offer a price, which the supplier can
accept or reject) is a strategy used in the hospitality and travel industry.
Travellers can offer a price for a room or a seat on a plane, say, and the
supplier chooses whether to accept. Pay what you want (where customers set
the price and the supplier must accept the offer) is used in the music and video
gaming industry. Participative pricing enables buyers to be directly involved in
setting prices (Reiseman et al. 2019). Now read Marketing in Action 9.3 to
find out about freemium pricing.
MARKETING IN ACTION 9.3
Freemium Pricing: Giving Away the Core Product to
Build a Global Brand
For Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and many more digital brands, there is only one
price for their core product: free. But each digital brand comes with a price to pay, although
not in the monetary sense, to enjoy its free services.
YouTube: you can view multiple channels of video and subscribe to your favourites, but
you must often watch related adverts before watching your chosen videos.
Spotify: music for everyone, Spotify has millions of audio tracks from a huge array of
recording artists. You can use this service on your computer, phone and other
peripherals. The free service requires you to listen to adverts, which are interspersed
with your chosen music selections.page 365
Google search: Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information. There are
significant costs to achieving this, and yet the search and web-browsing facilities (which
comprise Google’s main product) are free. However, the price we all pay is to reveal our
browsing habits, the products and brands we are interested in, at what time of day and
for how long we are online, the locations where we access Google, and the devices we
use. All this information is tracked and analysed, providing valuable profiling data on
billions of people. These can then be used to power Google’s advertising products,
which are highly profitable.
Facebook: a social networking site, where many of us share our lives, loves, hates,
photos and personal details with our friends. Another ‘free’ service? The price is once
again the information we provide, which enables Facebook, like Google, to sell highly
targeted advertising. Facebook has also been involved in a political scandal and
accused of enabling targeted content to be used for political gain.

These are just a few examples of how digital brands are making us ‘pay’ for their services
with personal behavioural information. This has significant implications for the pricing of
products and services in the digital space and how services are costed.
Based on: Cadwalladr and Graham-Harrison (2018)
Demand pricing
Dynamic pricing has also facilitated the growth of yield management systems,
which allow prices to change according to supply and demand. In the
hospitality industry, firms tend to have high fixed costs and low marginal costs,
and dynamic pricing for advanced bookings is one way to increase profitability
as prices are automatically tailored to meet demand (Bigne et al. 2021).
American Airlines was the pioneer in developing yield (demand)
management, and the system has since been adopted by other airlines such as
easyJet, hotel chains such as Premier Inn, and intercity bus companies such asmegabus in the UK and OnniBus in Finland. Using hotels as an example, when
a room is first offered on the market, the price is typically set low to attract
customers. As the hotel moves closer to full capacity, the price rises by an
amount that is dependent on demand. If demand is low, the price rise will be
small or the price could even fall, but if demand is high, meaning there are
very few rooms available, the price will rise sharply. Customers are never told
how soon or by how much the price will be changed. The objective is to
maximize occupancy and thereby revenue (yield), because when selling airline
or bus seats or hotel rooms, vacancies cannot be stored; if seats or rooms are
not occupied, the revenue from them is lost. The system is based on
sophisticated statistical modelling, with the key variable being the number of
seats/rooms unsold, although other factors, such as the number of clicks on the
website, also influence price, as a high number of clicks is often indicative of
forthcoming sales. Airbnb has a dynamic demand-based smart pricing system,
but hosts have discretion over certain variables that can influence the final
price.
Surge pricing is a related dynamic pricing method based on demand and
supply and time. When demand increases, so too do prices. The increase is
temporary as price will fall again as demand for a service ebbs. Online retailers
can vary their prices based on the times most people shop. Uber’s ride-sharing
app increases prices at busy times – at the beginning and end of work days, at
weekends and in festive seasons – and also responds to changing weather
conditions. If there is heavy rain or snow, the price of a ride will go up. The
same goes for busy locations, city centres, tourist sights and events (e.g. a
major football tournament).
Real-time pricing
Real-time pricing reflects the current price of a good or service every time the
market changes. Again, digital technology applications provide mechanisms to
assess supply and demand and generate prices that can be applied a moment at
a time. For example, with an increasing need for energy-efficient consumption,
smart meters used in the energy industry provide two-way communication
between energy provider and consumer, enabling the provider to vary prices in
real time based on demand, to give the consumer the best rates. Google uses
real-time pricing for its Google Ads, where the price of certain advertising key
words can vary depending on external variables.page 366
While dynamic pricing methods create opportunities for innovative and
automated approaches towards pricing, using algorithms to drive profits,
marketing managers should be aware of ethical issues emerging from
widespread application of these approaches to pricing. Nunan and Di
Donmenico (2022) suggest several sources of resistance to dynamic pricing
that could impede the co-creation of value. These include consumers’
perceived lack of control over the prices they pay, reduced control for the firm
applying the dynamic pricing approach, and limited communication between
consumer and firm with regard to price. For example, low-cost airlines Ryanair
and easyJet regularly receive customer complaints about system-generated
pricing and how this can change between finding a price and eventually
booking a flight, and over which the customer has no control.
Pricing and Marketing Strategy
The price of a product should be set in line with marketing strategy. If a price
is viewed in isolation (as with full-cost pricing), with no reference to other
marketing decisions, such as positioning, strategic objectives, promotion,
distribution, product benefits and the marketing environment, the result is the
price gives an inconsistent message and may cause customer confusion. To
avoid this situation, pricing decisions should align with strategic decisions in
the marketing planning process (see Chapter 17). For new products, the setting
of price will depend on positioning strategy; for existing products, it will be
affected by strategic objectives.
Pricing new products and services
The usual pricing objective for new products is to gain profitable market
penetration. However, occasionally, organizations will sacrifice short-term
profits to achieve long-term goals. Mobile phone and broadband providers use
complex tiered pricing plans, with menus offering different service packages.
Introductory offers are used to motivate consumers to sign up for initial deals,which then bind them to a service contract for many months (Calzada and
Martínez-Santos 2016).
In this section, we explore how positioning strategy affects price, launch
strategies based upon skimming and penetration pricing, and the factors
affecting decisions to charge a high or low price.
Positioning strategy
A key decision that marketing management faces when launching new
products is positioning strategy. This in turn will have a major influence on
price. As discussed in Chapter 7, product positioning involves the choice of
target market and the creation of a differential advantage. Each of these factors
can have an enormous impact on price. When strategy is being set for a new
product, marketing management is often faced with an array of potential target
markets. In each, the product’s differential advantage (value) may differ.
For new products, marketing management must decide on a target market
and on the value people in that segment place on the product (the extent of its
differential advantage); only then can a market-based price be set which
reflects that value. Second, where multiple segments appear attractive,
modified versions of the product should be designed and priced differently, not
according to differences in costs but in line with the respective values each
target market places on the product. Digital products and pricing methods can
be used effectively to align customer needs in a particular segment with a
pricing method.
The expansion of digital products and services has increased the number of
types of subscription-based pricing models, based around types of customers
and how they intend to use a product or service. Some examples of different
types of subscription packages are:
Flat-rate offer: fixed prices can work out expensive if a firm wants to have
multiple users, but can work out well for single users/individuals, who can
have unlimited use of all of a product’s features, for example a project
management program.
Tiered, offering various features and product combinations at different price
points (e.g. basic, standard, premium). Firms can use this approach to
maximize the lifetime value of a customer as their needs grow.
Usage based: often referred to a pay-as-you-go, used widely by mobile
phone operators. This works best when there is varied usage.Per added module: in this case you would begin with the base product and
add options to give more functionality. The Motley Fool, a share-trading
advisory service, uses this approach to sell increasingly detailed and
complex share advice and information services (O’Brien 2021b).
When selecting a subscription-based pricing model firms should consider
customer needs, and how they will want to use the product and service,
scalability and the extent to which the product or service can be extended to
meet the lifetime value needs of the customer. A firm should also take into
account the time and resources available to its customer base, and consider
competitors and how they are using subscription pricing (O’Brien 2021b). See
Exhibit 9.3 for an example of subscription packages.

Launch strategies
In launch strategies, price should be blended with other elements of the
marketing mix. Figure 9.6 presents four marketing strategies based on
combinations of price and promotion. Similar matrices could also be
developed for product and distribution, but for illustrative purposes promotion
will be used here.
FIGURE 9.6
New product launch strategiespage 367
A combination of high price and high promotion expenditure is called a
rapid skimming strategy. The high price provides high margin returns on
investment and the heavy promotion creates high levels of product awareness
and knowledge. Nike usually employs a rapid skimming strategy
when it launches new ranges of trainers. Coca-Cola also employs
rapid skimming strategies. A slow skimming strategy combines high price with
low levels of promotional expenditure. High prices mean big profit margins,
but high levels of promotion are believed to be unnecessary, perhaps because
word of mouth is more important and the product is already well known (e.g.
Rolls-Royce) or because heavy promotion is thought to be incompatible with
product image.
Firms that combine low prices with heavy promotional expenditure are
practising a rapid penetration strategy. The aim here is to gain market share
rapidly, perhaps at the expense of a rapid skimmer. For example, no-frills
airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair have successfully attacked British Airways
by adopting a rapid penetration strategy. Direct Line is an example of a firm
that has challenged traditional UK insurance companies with great success by
using heavy promotion and a low charge for its insurance policies.
Supermarkets also use a rapid penetration strategy, with low prices being
heavily promoted. For example, Tesco uses the strapline ‘Every little helps’,
Asda uses ‘Get the Asda price feeling’ and Lidl uses ‘Big on quality, Lidl on
price’.
Finally, a slow penetration strategy combines a low price with low
promotional expenditure. Own-label brands use this strategy – promotion is
not necessary to gain distribution and low promotional expenditure helps to
maintain high profit margins for these brands. Supermarket chains Aldi and
Lidl adopted a slow penetration strategy in their early years in the UK. The
low promotional expenditures help to promote the low cost base necessary to
support their low prices.Factors affecting whether to charge a high or low price
The price/promotion framework in Figure 9.6 is useful in thinking about
marketing strategies at launch. A major question remains, however: when is it
sensible to use a high price (skimming) strategy and when should a low price
(penetration) strategy be used (Jobber and Shipley 1998)? To answer this
question, we need to understand the characteristics of market segments that
can bear a high price. These characteristics are shown in Table 9.4. The higher
the number of these characteristics present, the more likely it is a high price
can be charged (Jobber and Shipley 2012).
TABLE 9.4 Characteristics of high-price market segments
1 Product provides high value
2 Customers have a high ability to pay
3 Consumer and bill payer are different
4 Lack of competition
5 Excess demand
6 High pressure to buy
7 Switching costs
The first characteristic is the market segment should place a high value on
the product, based on the customer benefits it provides. Washing machines
(and other white goods) provide high functional value, whereas other products
(e.g. perfumes and clothing) may rely more on psychological value, where
brand image is crucial (e.g. the latest Jimmy Choo shoes or new Chanel

Second, high prices are more likely to be viable where customers have a
high ability to pay. Cash-rich segments in organizational markets often
correlate with profitability. For example, the financial services sector and the
textile industry in Europe may place a similar value on marketing consultancy
skills, but in general the former has more ability to pay.
In certain markets, the consumer of the product is different from the bill
payer. This distinction may form the basis of a high-price market segment. Rail
travel, for instance, is often segmented by price sensitivity. Early-morning
long-distance trips are more expensive than midday journeys, since the former
are usually made by business people and it is often their employer that will be
paying for their travel.
The fourth characteristic of high-price segments is lack of competition
among supplying companies. The extreme case is a monopoly where
customers have only one supplier from which to buy. When customers have
no, or very little, choice of supply, the power to determine price is largely in
the hands of suppliers. This means high prices can be charged if suppliers so
wish.
The fifth characteristic of high price segments is excess demand. When
demand exceeds supply, there is the potential to charge high prices. For
example, when the demand for gold/petrol/cocoa exceeds supply, the price of
gold/petrol/cocoa usually rises. Conversely, when there is excess supply, prices
usually fall.The next situation where customers are likely to be less price sensitive is
where there is high pressure to buy. For example, in an emergency where a
vital part is required to repair a machine that is needed to fulfil a major order,
the customer may be willing to pay a high price if a supplier can guarantee fast
delivery.
The final situation where high prices can be charged is where there are
high switching costs. Buyers may have made investments in dealing with a
supplier that they would have to make again if they switched suppliers.
Production, logistical or marketing operations may be geared to using the
equipment of a supplier (e.g. computer systems). Customers may have
invested heavily in product-specific training that would have to be repeated if
they chose to switch. These factors are likely to make customers less sensitive
to the price charged by existing suppliers in such circumstances.
The task of the marketing manager is to evaluate the chosen target market
for a new product using the checklist provided in Table 9.5. It is unlikely all
seven conditions will apply, and so judgement is still required, but the more of
these characteristics found in the target market, the greater the chances a high
price can be charged.
TABLE 9.5 Conditions for charging a low price
1 Only feasible alternative
2 Market penetration or domination
3 Experience curve effect/low costs
4 Make money later
5 Make money elsewhere
6 Barrier to entry
7 Predation
Table 9.5 lists the conditions when a low price (penetration) strategy
should be used. The first situation is when an analysis of the market segment
using the previous checklist reveals a low price is the only feasible alternative.
For example, for a product that has no differential advantage launched onto a
market where customers are not cash rich, pay for themselves, have little
pressure to buy and have many suppliers to choose from, there is no basis forcharging a price premium. At best it could take the going-rate price but, more
likely, would be launched using a penetration (low-price) strategy, otherwise
there would be no incentive for customers to switch from their usual brand.
The power of consumers to force down prices is nowhere greater than on the
internet, as this significantly improves price transparency.
There are, however, more positive reasons for using a low-price strategy. A
firm may wish to gain market penetration or domination by pricing its
products aggressively. This requires a market containing at least one segment
of price-sensitive consumers (see Exhibit 9.5). Direct Line priced its insurance
policies aggressively to challenge traditional insurance companies and is now
market leader for home and motor insurance in the UK. Tesco, the UK
supermarket chain, became market leader through charging low prices for
good-quality products, although its position is being eroded by European
chains Aldi and Lidl, which offer lower prices.

Penetration pricing for market presence is sometimes followed by price
increases once market share has reached a satisfactory level.
Low prices may also be charged to increase output and so bring down costs
through the experience curve effect. Research has shown that, for many
products, costs decline by around 20 per cent when production doubles (Abell
and Hammond 1979). Cost economies are achieved by learning how to
produce the product more effectively through better production processes and
improvements in skill levels. Economies of scale through, for example, the usepage 369
of more cost-effective machines at higher output levels also act to lower costs
as production rises. Marketing costs per unit of output may also
fall as production rises. For example, an advertising expenditure
of £1 million represents 1 per cent of revenue when sales are £100 million, but
rises to 10 per cent of revenue when sales are only £10 million. Therefore, a
firm may choose to price aggressively to become the largest producer and, if
the experience curve holds, the lowest-cost supplier.
Intel Corporation has taken full advantage of the cost economies that come
with being market leader in the microprocessor market, with over 80 per cent
share and the investment of billions of dollars in hyper-productive plants that
can produce more processors in a day than some of its rivals can produce in a
year (Edwards 2006). This has given it the option of achieving higher profit
margins than its competitors or charging lower prices, as it did with its top￾performing Pentium processor; prices dropped by 57 per cent in a six-week
period in a move designed to hurt its major rival, Advanced Micro Devices
(AMD) (Popovich 2002). But after a long competitive battle lasting more than
50 years, AMD introduced the Ryzen microprocessor and positioned it as more
affordable than Intel’s microchips. Ryzen was a completely new design with
increased functionality, delivering increased benefits to its users. This product
and pricing strategy helped AMD gain market share from Intel (Hayes 2021).
Indeed, low costs through ruthless cost cutting may be necessary to achieve
profits using low-price strategies. For example, Costco, the US-based
membership warehouse club, keeps costs low by displaying products on racks
and in the packaging in which they are delivered. With its no-frills service and
focus ‘on marketing not advertising’, Costco is the fifth largest global retailer
(Berthiaume 2022).
A low-price strategy can also make sense when the objective is to make
money later. Three circumstances can provoke this action.
First, the sale of the basic product may be followed by profitable after-sales
service and/or spare parts. For example, contracting the sale of a computer
system (for a large organization) at cost may be worthwhile if substantial
profits can be made on the later sale of support services, software and
maintenance. Hewlett Packard’s Envy printer is a budget all-in-one colour
printer selling for less than £100. A set of replacement ink cartridges sells at
around £36, so the lifetime cost of the printer can be quite high. To persuade
consumers to buy its printers, it uses promotional marketing tactics, with
special offers of nine months’ supply of Instant Ink included in an extra year’s
warranty. HP is effectively bundling benefits (which are low cost to the firmbut perceived as high value to the consumer) to secure the initial sale.
Technology firms have exploited similar strategies. Dropbox offers cloud￾based file storage; it gives away its basic product but places storage limits.
Once these are exceeded, users of the service must buy more capacity by
signing up to a payment subscription.
Second, the price sensitivity of customers may change over time as
circumstances change. For example, digital cameras were highly priced
initially then prices began to fall as more competitors entered the market.
Prices then fell further as mobile phones and smartphones incorporated highly
sophisticated cameras as part of a bundle of features.
Third, marketers also charge low prices to make money elsewhere. For
example, retailers often use loss leaders, which are advertised to attract
customers into their stores and to create a low-cost image. Supermarkets
compete with traditional petrol retailers using petrol as a loss leader to attract
motorists to their stores. Manufacturers selling a range of products to
organizations may accept low prices on some goods to be perceived by
customers as a full-range supplier. In both cases, sales of other higher-priced
and more profitable products benefit.
Low prices can also act as a barrier to entry. A firm may decide the longer￾term benefits of deterring competition by accepting low margins are greater
than the short-term advantages of a high-price, high-margin strategy, which
may attract rivals into its market.
Finally, there are ethical and legal considerations when setting low prices
as they may be charged to put other companies out of business; this is known
as predation. However, this approach can cause harmful price wars, and in
many countries is considered an anticompetitive practice and is controlled by
regulatory authorities.
Deceptive pricing is another ethical consideration. It occurs when
consumers are misled by the price deals offered by companies. Misleading
price comparisons occur when a store sets artificially high prices for a short
time so much lower ‘sale’ prices can be claimed later. The purpose of this is to
deceive customers into believing they are being offered bargains. Some
countries, such as the UK and Germany, have laws stating the minimum period
for which the regular price should be charged before it can be used as a
reference price in a sale.
Pricing existing products and servicespage 370
For new products, the pricing objective is straightforward: to build profitable
sales and market share. However, for existing products, the choice is not so
clear-cut. The pricing of existing products should be set within the context of
strategy. Specifically, the strategic objective for each product has a major
bearing on pricing objectives and actions. As with new products,
existing products should not be priced in isolation, but pricing should
be consistent with strategic objectives. Three strategic objectives are relevant
to pricing: build, hold and harvest. These will impact on pricing objectives and
actions (see Table 9.6).
1. Build objective: relevant pricing objectives would be market penetration
and market share leadership. Achieving these goals should result in long￾term profit maximization. For price-sensitive markets, an appropriate
pricing action would be to price lower than the competition or use value
leadership, where the customer benefit-to-price ratio is kept higher than that
of the competition. If the competition raises its prices, the response is to be
slow to match it, whereas for price falls it is to be fast to match. For price￾insensitive markets, the best pricing strategy becomes less clear-cut. Price in
these circumstances is dependent on the overall positioning strategy deemed
appropriate for the product.
2. Hold objective: the corresponding pricing objective is to maintain sales
and/or market share. Appropriate pricing actions are to maintain or match
price relative to the competition or to use value parity, where the customer
benefit-to-price ratio is maintained vis-à-vis the competition. The response
to competitors’ price changes is to match them quickly.
3. Harvest objective: appropriate pricing objectives are to maintain or raise
profit margins for the purposes of short-term profit maximization, even if the
result is long-term falling sales and/or market share. Pricing actions are to
set or maintain premium prices. For products that are being harvested, there
would be much greater reluctance to match price cuts than for products that
are being built or held. On the other hand, price increases would swiftly be
matched, consistent with raising profit margins. Examples of brands being
harvested (high price/low promotion) are Bovril, Horlicks, Ovaltine and
Fabergé’s Brut men’s fragrance.

The above examples show how developing clear strategic objectives helps
the setting of price and clarifies the appropriate reaction to competitive price
changes. Price setting, then, is much more sophisticated than simply asking
‘How much can I get for this product?’ The process starts by asking more
fundamental questions like ‘How is this product going to be positioned in the
marketplace?’ and ‘What is the appropriate strategic objective for this
product?’ Only after these questions have been answered can price sensibly be
determined.
Market-orientated companies also need to take account of where the price
of a new product fits into their existing product line. Managing brand-line
assortments needs careful consideration as increasing product lines need to
ensure the investment will deliver wider market coverage and satisfy customer
needs (Barroso and Giarratana 2013). By producing a range of brands at
different price points, firms can cover the varying price sensitivities of
customers and encourage them to trade up to the more expensive, higher￾margin brands.page 371
Initiating Price Changes
As we have seen, there are different approaches to setting prices, each with its
own levels of complexity and influences to consider. In a highly competitive
world, pricing is dynamic: managers need to know when and how to raise or
lower prices, and whether to react to competitors’ price moves. First, let’s
discuss initiating price changes, before analysing how to react to competitors’
price changes.
Three key issues associated with initiating price changes are the
circumstances that may lead a firm to raise or lower prices, the tactics that can
be used, and estimating competitor reaction.
Circumstances
A price increase may be justified for several reasons:
Value found to be greater than price discovered through marketing research
(e.g. trade-off analysis or experimentation), which reveals customers place a
higher value on the product than is reflected in its price.
Rising costs, and hence reduced profit margins, may also stimulate price
rises.
Excess demand: a firm that cannot supply the demand created by its
customers may choose to raise prices to balance demand and supply; this
can be an attractive option, as profit margins are automatically widened.
Harvest objective: prices are raised to increase margins, even though sales
may fall.
Correspondingly, price cuts may be provoked by the discovery that price is
high compared with the value customers place on the product, falling costs
(and the desire to bring down costs further through the experience curve
effect), and where there is excess supply leading to excess capacity. A further
circumstance that may lead to price falls is the adoption of a build objective.
When customers are thought to be price-sensitive, price cutting may be used to
build sales and market share. Finally, price cuts may result from pre-empting
competitive entry into a market. Proactive price cuts – before the newcompetitor enters – are painful to implement because they incur short-term
profit sacrifices, but they immediately reduce the attractiveness of the market
to the potential entrant and reduce the risk of customer annoyance if prices are
reduced only after competitive entry.
Tactics
Price increases and cuts can be implemented in many ways:
A price jump or fall increases or decreases the price by the full amount in
one go. A price jump avoids prolonging the pain of a price increase over a
long period but may raise the visibility of the price increase to customers.
Staged price increases might make the price rise more palatable but run the
risk of a firm being accused of constant prices rises. A one-stage price fall
can have a high-impact dramatic effect that can be heavily promoted, but
also has an immediate impact on profit margins. Staged price reductions
have a less dramatic effect and may be used when a price cut is believed to
be necessary but the amount necessary to stimulate sales is unclear; small
cuts may be initiated as a learning process that proceeds until the desired
effect on sales has been achieved.
Escalator clauses: the contracts for some organizational purchases are
drawn up before the product has been made. Constructing the product – for
example, a new defence system or motorway – may take several years. An
escalator clause in the contract allows the supplier to stipulate price
increases in line with a specified index – for example, increases in industry
wage rates or the cost of living.
Price unbundling is another tactic that effectively raises prices. Many
product offerings actually consist of a set of products for which an overall
price is set (e.g. computer hardware and software). Price unbundling allows
each element in the offering to be priced separately in such a way the total
price is raised. A variant on this process is charging for services that were
previously included in the product’s price. For example, manufacturers of
mainframe computers have the option of unbundling installation and
training services and charging for them separately.
Lower discounts to customers: in periods of heavy demand for new cars, for
instance, dealers lower the cash discount given to customers.
Firms contemplating a price cut have three options besides a direct price
fall. A firm defending a premium-priced brand under attack from a cut-pricepage 372
competitor may choose to maintain its price while introducing a fighter brand.
The established brand thus keeps its premium-price position while the fighter
brand competes with the rival for price-sensitive customers. Where several
products and services that tend to be bought together are priced separately,
price bundling can be used to effectively lower price. For example, televisions
can be offered with free three-year repair warranties or cars with free labour at
first service. Finally, discount terms can be made more attractive by increasing
the percentage or lowering the qualifying levels. However, giving higher
discounts over too long a period can be risky, as General Motors found to
disastrous effect. By pursuing a four-year price discounting
strategy in the US in the face of poor sales, it provoked a price
war with Ford and Chrysler, caused consumers to focus on price rather than the
value offered by the product, and reduced its profits (Simon 2005).
Estimating competitor reaction
A key factor in the price change decision is the extent of competitor reaction. A
price rise no competitor follows may turn customers away, while a price cut
met by the competition may reduce industry profitability. Four factors likely to
affect the extent of competitor reaction are as follows:
1. Competitors’ strategic objectives for their products. By observing pricing
and promotional behaviour, talking to distributors and generally researching
competitor behaviour, it should be possible to estimate whether competitor
products/services are being built, held or harvested. This market intelligence
helps evaluate competitors’ response to a price increase or cut. They are
more likely to follow a price increase if their strategic objective is to hold or
harvest. If they are intent on building market share, they are more likely to
resist following a price increase.
2. Self-interest is also important when estimating competitor reactions.
Managers initiating price changes should try to place themselves in the
position of their competitors. What reaction is in their best interests? This
may depend on the circumstances of the price change. For example, if price
is raised in response to a general rise in cost inflation, the competition is
more likely to follow than if price is raised because of the implementation of
a harvest objective.
3. Competitive situation – for example, if the competition has excess capacity,
a price cut is more likely to be matched than if this is not the case. Similarly,a price rise is more likely to be followed if the competition is faced with
excess demand.
4. Past experience is not always a reliable guide – it may provide insights into
the way in which competitors view price changes and the likely responses
they might make. Experience may be supplemented by statements of intent.
Reacting to Competitors’ Price
Changes
When competitors initiate price changes, firms need to analyse their
appropriate reactions. Three issues are relevant here, as discussed below.
When to follow
Competitive price increases are more likely to be followed when:
rising cost levels affect all firms
there is excess demand industry-wide, with stimulus to raise prices the same
for all parties
a price-insensitive follower (competitor) will not gain much advantage by
resisting the price increase
brand image is consistent with high prices – a firm is more likely to follow a
competitor’s price rise, as to do so would be consistent with the brand’s
positioning strategy
there is a harvest or hold objective, because, in both cases, the emphasis is
more on profit margin than sales/market share gain.
Price cuts are likely to be followed when:
falling costs mean all firms can lower production costs; falling costs allow
all companies to cut prices while maintaining margins, and excess supply
means a firm is unlikely to allow a rival to make sales gains at its expense
excess supply weakens demand
the market is price-sensitive, since allowing one firm to cut price without
retaliation would mean large sales gains for the price cutter; the image of the
firm can also affect reaction to price cuts – some firms position themselves
as low-price manufacturers or retail outlets and in such circumstances theypage 373
would be less likely to allow a price reduction by a competitor to go
unchallenged, for to do so would be incompatible with their brand image
build or hold strategic objectives are being followed – in such
circumstances, an aggressive price move by a competitor would be followed
to prevent sales/market share loss; in the case of a build objective, the
response may be more dramatic, with a price fall exceeding the initial
competitive move.
When to ignore
The circumstances associated with firms not reacting to a competitive price
move are, in most cases, simply the opposite of the above. Price increases are
likely to be ignored when:
costs are stable or falling, which means there are no cost pressures forcing a
general price rise
there is excess supply – firms may view a price rise as making the initiator
less competitive, and therefore allow the price rise to take place
unchallenged, particularly when customers are price sensitive
companies occupying low-price positions may regard a price rise in
response to a price increase from a rival to be incompatible with their brand
image
a build objective is being followed, allowing a competitor’s price rise to go
unmatched to gain sales and market share.
Price cuts are likely to be ignored in conditions of rising costs, excess
demand and when servicing price-insensitive customers. Premium-price
positioners may be reluctant to follow competitors’ price cuts, for to do so
would be incompatible with brand image. Lastly, price cuts may be resisted by
companies using a harvest objective.
Tactics
When a firm decides to follow a price change, it can do so quickly or slowly. A
quick price reaction is likely when there is an urgent need to improve profitpage 374
margins. Here the competitor’s price increase will be welcomed as an
opportunity to achieve this objective.
Conversely, a slow reaction may be desirable when an image of being the
customer’s friend is sought. The first firm to announce a price increase is often
seen as the high-price supplier. Some companies have mastered the art of
playing the low-cost supplier by never initiating price increases and following
competitors’ increases slowly (Ross 1984). The key to this tactic is timing the
response: too quick and customers do not notice; too slow and profit is
forgone. The optimum period can be found only through experience but,
during it, salespeople should be told to stress to customers the firm is doing
everything it can to hold prices for as long as possible.
A quick response to a competitor’s price fall will happen to ward off a
competitive threat. In the face of undesirable sales/market share erosion, fast
action is needed to nullify potential competitor gains. However, reaction will
be slow when a firm has a loyal customer base willing to accept higher prices
for a period as long as they can rely on price parity over the longer term.
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapterpage 375
 Detailed Review
1. Why is an economist’s approach to pricing important?
The economist’s approach to pricing was developed as an explanation of market
behaviour, and focuses on demand and supply. There are limitations in applying
this approach in practice, which means marketers turn to other methods in
business.
2. Cost-orientated approach to pricing; the differences between full-cost and
direct-cost pricing
Full-cost pricing takes into account both fixed and direct costs. Direct-cost pricing
takes into account only direct costs such as labour and materials.
Both full-cost and direct-cost pricing suffer from the problem that they are internally
orientated methods. Direct-cost pricing can be useful when the corporate objective
is survival and there is a desperate need to fill capacity.
3. Competitor-orientated pricing approaches; going-rate pricing and competitive
bidding
Going-rate pricing is setting price levels at the rate generally applicable in the
market, focusing on competitors’ offerings and prices rather than on firm costs.
Marketers try to avoid going-rate pricing by creating a differential advantage.
Competitive bidding involves the drawing up of detailed specifications for a product
and putting the contract out to tender. Potential suppliers bid for the order, with
price an important choice criterion. Competitive bidding models have been
developed to help the bidding process, but they have several limitations.
4. Customer-orientated pricing, and the advantages of value-based pricing over
cost-orientated and competitor-orientated pricing methods
Customer-orientated pricing takes into account a much wider range of factors that
are relevant to the setting of prices. Although costs and competition are still taken
into account, marketers will take a much more customer-orientated view of pricing,
including customers’ willingness to pay, as reflected in the perceived value of the
product. Marketers will also evaluate the target market of the product to establish
the price sensitivity of customers. This will be affected by such factors as the
degree of competition, the degree of excess demand and the ability of target
customers to pay a high price.
5. Dynamic pricing approaches
Technology is having a major impact on prices. Innovations in digital technology
and access to large data sources are creating opportunities for innovative forms ofpage 376
dynamic pricing, which can create value for firms and their customers. Approaches
include demand pricing and real-time pricing.
6. Pricing and marketing; the factors that affect price setting when using a
customer-orientated approach
A customer-orientated pricing approach involves the analysis of marketing
strategy, value to the customer, price–quality relationships, explicability, product
line pricing, competition, negotiating margins, effect on distributors/retailers,
political factors and costs.
7. When and how to initiate price increases and cuts
Initiating price increases is likely to be carried out when value is greater than price,
in the face of rising costs, when there is excess demand and where a harvest
objective is being followed.
Tactics are price jumps, staged price increases, escalator clauses, price
unbundling and lower discounts.
Initiating price cuts is likely to be carried out when value is less than price, when
there is excess supply, where a build objective is being followed, where a price war
is unlikely and when there is a desire to pre-empt competitive entry.
Tactics are price falls, staged price reductions, the use of fighter brands, price
bundling and higher discounts.
8. When and when not to follow competitor-initiated price increases
and cuts; when to follow quickly and when to follow slowly
Competitor-initiated price increases should be followed when there are rising
costs, excess demand, price-insensitive customers, where the price rise is
compatible with brand image, and where a harvest or hold objective is being
followed.
Competitor-initiated price increases should not be followed when costs are stable
or falling, with excess supply, with price-sensitive customers, where the price rise
is incompatible with brand image and where a build objective is being followed.
The price increase should be followed quickly when the need for margin
improvement is urgent, and slowly when there are gains to be made by being seen
to be the customer’s friend.
Competitor-initiated price cuts should be followed when there are falling costs,
excess supply, price-sensitive customers, where the price cut is compatible with
brand image, and where a build or hold objective is being followed.
Competitor-initiated price cuts should not be followed when there are rising costs,
excess demand, price-insensitive customers, where the price fall is incompatible
with brand image and where a harvest objective is being followed.
The price cut should be followed quickly when there is a need to offset a
competitive threat, and slowly where there is high customer loyalty.

CASE 17
A RECIPE FOR SUCCESS:
ADDING NEW
INNOVATIONS TO THE POT
The Keogh’s brand has 11 per cent of the Irish crisp market and is ‘the only Irish owned brand
at mass market level’ (RTE 2022). This success did not happen overnight. Innovation is in the
roots of Keogh’s Crisps with a business dating back 200 years. The family business, now
known for its tasty snack and food offerings, was originally a traditional potato farm supplyingDublin city wholesale markets. However, change was imminent when the Keogh family
observed a 50 per cent decline in potato consumption in the early 2000s. The Irish, a nation of
potato eaters, had developed a taste for convenience and a broader palate for global food. As a
result, the business needed to adapt and innovate to reconnect with the Irish consumer. In
2006, it developed a new product – the first of its kind in the world at the time – as a solution for
the time-poor, money-rich consumer: easy-cook potatoes. This product was to be cooked within
a bag in the microwave, tasting as good as a boiled potato but prepared in a more convenient
and efficient way.
While potato sales remained a core product offering, Keogh’s knew it had to diversify to
maintain growth in a market increasingly interested in pasta and rice as alternatives to
potatoes. To assist in the more efficient and consistent delivery of new product developments
(NPDs), a specialist consultancy company was brought in to the business in 2016 to assist
Keogh’s Crisps in the NPD process – from idea generation, to understanding the market, to
understanding the consumer. Traditionally, NPD was delivered by Keogh’s Crisps, but with no
great depth of research undertaken. However, with a bigger team, it now practises a stage-gate
process, with continual review of NPD decisions by management at distinct stages, taking into
consideration market information available alongside risk analysis and availability of resources.
Idea generation and sharing are encouraged in Keogh’s Crisps, as the management team
values and includes inputs from all team members. These ideas are listened to and fed in to the
idea-generation process. With ideas coming back even while employees are travelling, both on
holiday and for business, innovation within Keogh’s Crisps is active and varied.page 381
Source: Keogh’s Crisps Ltd
Crisps originally emerged as the new, and ultimately successful, arm of the business and its
product offerings. The NPD started in the kitchen of the Keogh family farmhouse, which at the
time was a cookery school. Experimentation began with frying, seasoning and using different
oils to create a product. Employees were encouraged to come up with new flavours and to test
the new products. Once the crisp products were developed, Keogh’s invested in new
equipment to enable it to scale production.
The first business plan was to be at farmers’ markets for three years, but the product resonated
with the Irish market much faster than expected – and way beyond the expectations of the
business. Keogh’s artisan potato crisps were launched in the depths of a recession in 2011,
and focus groups with Bord Bia, the Irish government organization responsible for
supporting food businesses, showed that the product was well received, with a
new Irish brand being seen as a ‘good news story’.

Skelligs in the background, also known as a filming location for Star Wars Episodes VII
and VIII

The brand started to gain traction as the whole potato, including the skin, was being used,
along with high-quality oil and seasonings. The product also had the advantage of being gluten
free. All local Irish authentic brands were sourced for flavourings (including salt from the Barra
Peninsula, cider vinegar from David Llewellyn’s Orchard and chorizo from Gubbeen
Smokehouse) and in this way Keogh’s Crisps started working with companies who were equally
passionate about their products. Not only were the flavourings sourced locally, but the imagery
used on the packaging for each individual flavour is unique and personal to the particular family
business and area from which the flavours are sourced.page 382
Source: Keogh’s Crisps Ltd
In 2012 Keogh’s Crisps wowed the world with its sensational shamrock-seasoned potato crisp.
The concept came from the popularity of seasonal products, so Keogh’s wanted to launch a
crisp product around the seasonal calendar. From concept to launch of the shamrock-flavoured
crisps took a total of 14 weeks and, within just one day, global PR was achieved. This product
launched the business to mainstream media attention – and in to the mouths of consumers.
Despite delisting the product after the St Patrick’s festival period, it was the subject of continued
demand and, today, it is Keogh’s third biggest seller after Mature Irish Cheese and Onion, and
Irish Sea Salt and Cider Vinegar. In addition to this, the flavours keep on coming, with further
innovation emerging in 2022 in the form of a collaboration between Cashel Blue cheese and
Keogh’s Crisps to create a very tasty new offering.
To service the family market, Keogh’s cleverly presents and packages its crisps with an eye to
tradition, giving a potato sack feel to its multipack bags.
Keogh’s Taste of Guinness
Keogh’s saw significant growth in 2020/21, with a 50 per cent surge in demand for crisps
(Murphy 2022). In 2021 Keogh’s used around nine million potatoes in what was a record sales
year for the crisp maker. Not a business to sit back on its success, however, Keogh’s kept
innovating and in 2021 joined forces with Guinness, Ireland’s best-known beer brand. The link
between the two families, Guinness and Keogh’s, dates back several generations,
to a time when Keogh’s sold grain to Guinness’s St James’s Gate Brewery. To
date, Keogh’s has enjoyed two limited-edition collaborations with Guinness. The first was
Guinness and Flame Grilled Steak flavour, followed by one of the oldest Guinness and food
combinations on record, Guinness and oysters, which is believed to date back to 1837 (Murphy
2022).Source: Keogh’s Crisps Ltd
The Snack Market
Due to the growing success of Keogh’s core range, crinkle cuts and multipack potato crisp
ranges, Keogh’s feels the pressure from crisp consumers to keep innovating. As well as
combining travel abroad for research purposes, Keogh’s continually utilizes focus groups to
assist with NPD, which maintains its understanding of the consumer at all times. In more recent
years Keogh’s has been faced with challenges from ‘me too’ products from bigger players while
trying to retain its current 8 per cent of the crisp market in Ireland. The Keogh’s team works
hard to maintain its distinct offering through the high quality and exceptional taste of its
products, with consumer trust underpinning the business and who it is. This is particularly
important in a market where ‘fake farm’ brands are emerging. One example of the authentic
connection between consumer and Keogh’s Crisps is evident through the creative ‘Spud Nav’ in
which consumers can trace the origins of their crisps by field and flavour: www.keoghs.ie/spud￾nav.
Keogh’s hunger for innovation led to its next success: award-winning hand-popped popcorn.
Keogh’s Popcorn: ‘Popped With Love in Ireland’
The same great taste and quality invested in Keogh’s Crisps was replicated in the production of
a new product range: popcorn, literally ‘popped with love in Ireland’. Tom Keogh, MD of
Keogh’s, ventured near and far to find the best-quality corn on the market. At first, they tried
growing their own corn on the family farm, but due to the Irish climate this could not be done.
Tom then looked to the US, where he found a small local farmer in Iowa from whom he was
able to purchase a mushroom-style corn. Having sourced this, Keogh’s hand cooks the kernels
in small batches on the family farm, adding just a touch of natural flavour for each variety.
Keogh’s initially launched three unique flavours – Honey and Sea Salt, Atlantic Sea Salt and
Sweet Chilli – working hard to create a visual story for each flavour, built around the natural
source of the Irish flavouring ingredients: the salt-grinder lighthouse, the larger-than-life busy
honey bees, and the firework chilli peppers and tomatoes. The range has experienced some
tweaks and changes over the years, with Sweet Chilli falling off the shelves due to lack of
demand and the introduction of Keogh’s Butter and Sea Salt in July 2020, in collaboration with
Glenilen Farm (Keogh’s 2022).page 383
Source: Keogh’s Crisps Ltd
Keogh’s worked hard to ensure its new product was positioned to sit well alongside its premium
crisp range, but also to differentiate itself so that the product offering was clear. As a new
product for Keogh’s, the business needed to position it clearly within the existing popcorn
category, and compete with other premium popcorn brands and crisp alternatives (such as rice,
vegetable and protein-based crisps). Keogh’s needed to find its own angle on why it, as a
potato expert, can own a premium positioning in the popcorn space while also ensuring the
core value of the Keogh’s masterbrand is very much part of this new offering. The approach is
working, and already the new popcorn range has a strong target market of females aged 25–45
years old.
The Future for Keogh’s
Keogh’s production doubled in capacity in 2022, in direct response to growing demand and its
regular new innovations. New trends are emerging, particularly in the 125 g share-bag
segment, illustrating an increase in purchase occasions for these bags. In addition, Keogh’s
now supplies major supermarket chains in the UK, US and Dubai. Each of these markets has
its own favourite Keogh’s flavoured crisps (RTE 2022). This global market is a
challenging one to navigate, with growing pressures on transport costs, changing
tastes and various customs/tariff restrictions. However, with continuous NPD and 200 years of
experience, Keogh’s is looking forward to new innovations and future collaborations with top￾tasting brands!
Questions
1. How has Keogh’s Crisps used innovation in marketing to build its brand?
2. What approach does Keogh’s take to developing innovative products?
3. How has Keogh’s Crisps achieved competitive advantage?
4. What is Keogh’s Crisps doing to ensure it will continue to innovate in the future?

COLLABORATIVE
INNOVATION: THE APPLE
AND NIKE PARTNERSHIP
Introduction
Apple is widely considered the number-one innovative company in the world. Founded by Steve
Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976, the company revolutionized personal technology with the
introduction of the Macintosh computer in 1984. Apple grew throughout the 1980s and 1990s,
despite both Wozniak and Jobs moving on to newer and bigger things. The company peaked in
1990, but by 1996 experts believed Apple to be doomed and on the verge of bankruptcy. It wasnot until 1997, when Steve Jobs returned to Apple and became interim CEO, that the
company’s fortunes began to turn around. Jobs revamped Apple computers and introduced the
iBook (a personal laptop). He also started branching out into MP3 players (iPod) and media
player software (iTunes). Although Steve Jobs died on 5 October 2011, Apple continues with his
legacy (Richardson and Terrell 2008). In 2018, Apple made history by becoming the first
private-sector company to surpass a market value of US$1 trillion, making it the most valuable
company on Earth (Gurman 2018). The tech giant has staged an unparalleled turnaround since
its near bankruptcy in the 1990s, and experts credit the company’s ongoing commitment to
innovation as key to its continued success. Apple now leads the world in innovation, with the
iPhone, iPad, iMac, Apple TV, AirPods, AirTag, HomePod Mini and the Apple Watch. These
innovative products provide consumers with seamless experiences across all Apple devices,
and empower people with breakthrough services such as Apple Music, Apple Fitness, Apple
Wallet and iCloud (Apple 2022a).

A Perfect Partnership
Making your brand stand out from the crowd in a hugely competitive marketplace has been one
of the biggest challenges facing Apple. The company has long seen the value of teaming up
and collaborating with other brands for commercial projects, to increase its brand exposure and
to reap dividends for the business. Over the years, Apple has teamed up with numerous
manufacturers and retailers, but its partnership with Nike is like no other. Nike and Apple have
long had a good relationship when it comes to the convergence of technology and athletics.
One of the first products that came from the relationship was the Nike+ running initiative
launched in 2006, which started with a small chip placed inside a Nike running shoe paired with
a connected Apple iPod (Westlake 2015). Having Tim Cook, Apple’s then CEO, on Nike’s board
allowed an effortless partnership with Apple by leveraging Apple’s hardware as the chip’s
receiver to track users’ distances and speed (Anonymous 2016). Since this initial collaboration
in 2006, there have been an abundance of collaborative product launches from the two
powerhouses.
One of their most successful collaborations resulted in Apple unveiling a new product in
collaboration with its long-standing partner Nike in 2016: the Series 2 Apple Watch Nike+. With
a price tag of $399, the device was geared towards runners and was promoted as the ultimate
companion for those with a passion for running, whether they were emerging runners or
marathon veterans. To get the most out of the watch, users needed to wirelessly tether to anpage 385
iPhone, allowing users to receive notifications and other updates. However, the Apple Watch
Nike+ could also be used autonomously for exercise and using apps. Apple unveiled its co￾branded watch with Nike to appeal to customers who wanted more specialized exercise
tracking compared with the standard Apple Watch model (Apple 2016). The watch was intended
to compete against the likes of Fitbit, Jawbone and Samsung, all of which offered fitness
trackers that doubled as smartwatches (Reisinger 2016).
For both Apple and Nike, it was important that the watch had a differential advantage over rival
brands in the competitive wearable technology market. The watch featured GPS, water
resistance to 50 metres, a powerful dual-core processor and watchOS 3. The
Apple Watch Nike+ also included exclusive Siri commands and iconic Nike watch
faces, along with deep integration with Nike’s new Nike+ Run Club app for motivation to go for
a run, coaching plans that adapt to the user’s unique schedule and progress, and guidance
from the world’s best coaches and athletes. According to Trevor Edwards, president of the Nike
brand, the collaborative effort between Nike and Apple resulted in a device that had an
immediate differential advantage: ‘The market is full of hard-to-read devices that focus on your
data. This focuses on your life. It’s a powerful device with a simple solution – your perfect
running partner.’ Ultimately, the Apple Watch Nike+ leveraged Apple’s incredible tech know-how
with Nike’s deep understanding of athletes (Tillman 2022).
Since the launch of the Series 2 Apple Watch Nike+ in 2016, Apple and Nike have continued to
collaborate on the development of the Apple Watch Nike+, adding features and improving the
watch’s design. In fact, each Apple Watch since Series 2 has had a Nike version (Tillman
2022). In 2021 Apple again teamed up with Nike to introduce the Series 7 Nike+ edition. This
watch contains several unique features such as Nike sports bands and sports loops in a variety
of colours, which like the standard Apple watch, can be changed easily. It also comes with
exclusive Nike-themed watch faces. It allows the user to measure blood oxygen with a powerful
sensor and app, and to take an ECG any time, anywhere. The user can also get high and low
heart rate and irregular heart rhythm notifications. The watch contains a new mindfulness app
and also a sleep app to help users reach their sleep goals. It allows users to track their daily
activities on the watch and see trends in the fitness app on their iPhone. Users can also sync
their favourite music, podcasts and audiobooks, and pay instantly and securely from their wrist
with Apple Pay. In addition, the watch allows the wearer to use the built in Nike Run Club app to
track their runs, view running history, and stay motivated with challenges and guided runs
(Apple 2022b).
Since its original release in 2016, the Apple Watch has been one of the most popular
smartwatches to date. While the device is appreciated by everyone from tech geeks to trend
chasers, it is especially loved by athletes, and Nike’s collaborative efforts with Apple have
always been their versions of choice (Kunert 2017). According to Jason Low, Canalys analyst,
‘What sets the Apple Watch apart is a renewed focus on fitness, its co-branding with Nike
helping to support this move. In addition, the availability of a wide range of accessories means
the Apple Watch appeals to tech savvy consumers with an eye for fashion’ (Riley 2018).
Conclusion
Apple has long nurtured collaborations with heritage luxury brands, starting with Hermès in
2015. Since then, designers including Coach, Kate Spade and Nike have all designed trendy
bands at high price points for the Apple Watch. However, Apple’s relationship with Nike has
proved to be one of its most successful collaborations. Apple recognized the potential of
working with Nike, and vice versa. They had similar audiences. They both had brand loyalists,page 386
and the union encouraged Apple diehards to try Nike+, and Nike+ lovers to buy the Apple
Watch (Young 2018).
Recent research suggests that consumers’ love affair with fitness bands looks to have run its
course, with smartwatches shaping up to be the preferred choice. Channel analyst Canalys has
indicated that sales of fitness bands fell 23.8 per cent year on year to just over 15.5 million units
in the second quarter of 2021. At the same time, smartwatch sales jumped 38 per cent to more
than 25.4 million units – some 62 per cent of the total wearable electronic market (Abdullah
2021). In 2021, Apple managed to maintain its number-one position in the smartwatch market
with a 30 per cent market share (Lim 2022). Apple is far in front of its competitors, with the
nearest rival being Samsung with 10.2 per cent, followed by Huawei with 7.7 per cent (Owen
2022). In addition, the Apple Watch also continues to be popular with those new to the device
and, during the second quarter of 2021, 75 per cent of people who purchased an Apple Watch
had not owned one before (Clover 2021). With the global smartwatch market valued at
shipments volume of 43.87 million in 2018 and expected to reach a volume of 108.91 million by
2024 – a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.5 per cent in the forecast period – Apple
appears well positioned for the future (Business Wire 2020).

rguably, innovation is the lifeblood of corporate success. From a
marketing perspective, it is important to consider how innovations and
new products can add value. Changing customer tastes, technological
advances and competitive pressures mean companies cannot afford to rely on
past product success. Firms should look closely at the needs of customers and
other stakeholders and the impact on the wider environment if they are to
develop innovative products and services that add value.Innovations require testing and development, and new product
development is a risky activity as most new products fail. But judgement in
terms of the percentage of failures should be avoided, as this could stifle the
spirit of innovation. The acid test is the number of successes. Failure must be
tolerated.
To fully understand innovation and new product development, we need to
distinguish between invention and innovation. Invention is the discovery of
new ideas and methods. Not all countries have the same capacity for invention.
The UK has a history of being inventive, from the steam engine and bicycle to
the television, computer and jet engine. In Scandinavia, many businesses were
built on a local invention. For example, Tetra Pak was founded by a person
who conceived of ‘pouring milk into a paper bag’. LEGO bricks
revolutionized toys, and IKEA’s invention of a new way to deliver furniture
was central to its phenomenal growth. In these cases, the key was not just the
invention but also the capability to innovate by bringing the product
successfully to market (Richard 1996).
Innovation is a concept that has no clear definition and yet is widely used
in many different disciplines. Baregheh et al. (2009) identified 60 definitions
of innovation from widespread areas of research: from marketing and
management to economic research and entrepreneurship. They also concluded
that a general (and multidisciplinary) definition of innovation should consider
the nature and type of innovation as well as the stages of the innovation
process and new product development, the social context and the aim of the
innovation. Table 10.1 lists some of the world’s most innovative firms, activity
sectors, country of origin and products. The US is a major source of
innovation, particularly in the technology industry. The selection of firms in
this list is based on the extent to which industries invest in innovation (Dyer
and Gregersen 2018), the capitalization of each firm and the previous trading
performance.

A key point to remember is the focus of innovation should be on providing
new solutions that better meet customer needs. Innovative solutions often do
not always require breakthroughs in technology. For example, the growth of
Starbucks was fuelled by redefining the meaning of city-centre coffee
drinking, and Ryanair built its success by creating a different consumer appeal
from that of traditional airlines, based on low prices and strict cost control
(Doyle 1997).
In this chapter, we consider the definition of innovation to be the process
that occurs when an invention is commercialized by bringing it to market and
we focus on new product development (NPD). We begin by asking the
question ‘What is an innovation and what is a new product?’ and examine
three key issues in new product development: organization, developing an
innovative culture, and the new product development process. Then we
examine the strategies involved in product replacement, the most common
form of new product development. Finally, we look at the consumer adoptionprocess, which is how people learn about innovations and new products, try
them, and adopt or reject them.
What is an Innovation and What is a
New Product?
Not all new products are innovations. Innovation is the process of translating
an idea into a product or service. Some new products are so fundamentally
different from existing products that they reshape markets and competition.
For example, in the past, satellite navigation systems created a new market for
digital navigation devices and significantly reduced the sale of printed road
maps. Publisher HarperCollins has said sales of maps and atlases declined
from £13.5 million worth in 2006 to £9.7 million in 2010 (Geoghegan 2011).
Table 10.2 shows some of the latest innovations reconfiguring the world in
which we live and work (Forbes Technology Council 2018).

World-shaping innovations are at one end of the scale; at the other extreme
are products and services that are making incremental improvements, for
example a shampoo that is different from existing products only by means of
its brand name, fragrance, packaging and colour but will still be referred to as
a new product. Booz and colleagues (1982) suggested four broad
categories of new product, and Earle et al. (2001) added two
additional new product development project categories:
1. Product development and replacement: account for about 45 per cent of all
new product launches, and include revisions and improvements to existing
products, for example Lucozade Sport has been reimagined and positioned
as a ‘body fuel’ and ‘fitwater’ to access new market segments.2. Product cost reduction: some product developments are lower-cost versions
of existing products reformulated or redesigned to cost less to produce.
3. Product improvements: Dyson releases new products based on
improvements to an existing product (e.g. its new bagless vacuum cleaner).
4. Product line extensions: these account for about 25 per cent of new product
launches and take the form of new products that add to a firm’s existing
product lines. This produces greater product depth. Chocolate Weetabix is
an extension that enables the well-known cereal brand to compete with
chocolate cereals. Sometimes changes in legislation motivate brands to
extend product lines, for example in the UK government proposals to ban
advertising of foods with high fat, salt and sugar content are encouraging the
introduction of low-fat, low-sugar and low-salt version of FMCG brands.
5. New product lines: these total around 20 per cent of new product launches
and represent a move into a new market. For example, in Europe, Volvic
introduced the Touch of Fruit range of bottled waters, and Evian brought out
a facial spray – both targeted at different audiences. This strategy widens a
firm’s product mix.
6. Innovations of new-to-the-world products: these total around 10 per cent of
new product launches and create entirely new markets. For example,
smartphones and voice-activated speakers have created new markets
because of the highly valued customer benefits they provide.

fuEL, a new-to-the-world brand and product range.
Clearly, the degree of risk and reward varies according to the new product
category. New-to-the-world products normally carry the highest risk, since it is
often very difficult to predict consumer reaction to them.
Effective new product development is based on creating and nurturing an
innovative culture, organizing effectively for new product development and
managing the new product development process. We shall now examine these
three issues.

HIDDEN GEM 10.1
Huel – HUman fuEL: A New-to-the-world Brand and
Product Range
University graduate Julian Hearn is a successful entrepreneur, who created Mash Up
Media, an affiliate marketing firm, which he sold to Internet Brands in 2011. Instead of
retiring on the proceeds of this successful sale he started looking at the health food market
and, with his co-founder and nutritionist James Collier, created Huel. Their aim was to
produce a new product that would get people to think differently about food, putting nutrition
and the environment before everything else. Founded in 2015, the product innovation was
very successful, quickly expanding to markets in the US and Europe, and achieving sales of
more than £100 million by 2022.Source: Huel
The new product: Huel
Huel is a complete meal, created by looking at our body’s nutritional needs rather than
developing a great-tasting meal supplement. Huel is an innovation designed to meet the
body’s energy needs; it is a powder, which initially required the addition of water, designed
around the nutrition content of foods. The basic ingredients are oats, pea protein, flaxseed,
brown rice, tapioca flour and sunflower oil. The powder is high in protein, from the peas and
rice, and with its many other ingredients is designed to save time, stop unwanted hunger
pangs, be a healthy alternative, plant-based foodstuff and can be used for weight
management. The original powder version comes in a range of flavours: unflavoured and
unsweetened, vanilla coffee, berry and chocolate. Huel products are 100 per cent vegan,
have a long shelf life, and are very low waste and low cost.
New product line extensions include a hot meals range – pasta Bolognese, mac and
cheese, Thai green curry, Mexican chilli, madras curry from the Huel hot and savoury range;
the Huel black edition range, with reduced carbs and more protein; bars and ready-to-drink
ranges.
‘Hueiligans’ is the name given to users of Huel – a loyal in-house and online community of
fans. Huel owns and manages its online forum and has used it to build a close connection
with its market. In this way the business has stayed well informed about customer views,
and the forum has played an important part in the rapid growth of this innovative new brand.

Creating and Nurturing an Innovative
Culturepage 392
The foundation of successful new product development is the creation of a
corporate culture that promotes and rewards innovation. Unfortunately, many
marketing managers regard their firm’s corporate culture as a key constraint to
innovation (Matthews 2002). Managers, therefore, need to pay more attention
to creating an innovation culture and managing teams, as strong cooperation
can have a positive effect on the outcomes of the innovation project (Rieger
and Klarmann 2022). A cooperative culture cannot be assumed but once
developed can deliver performance benefits in terms of creativity and
innovation (Colovic and Williams 2020).
Figure 10.1 shows the kinds of attitudes and actions that can foster an
innovative culture. People in organizations observe those actions likely to lead
to success or punishment. The surest way to kill innovative spirit is to
conspicuously punish people who are prepared to create and champion new
product ideas, and to reward those people who are content to manage the status
quo. Such actions breed the attitude ‘Why should I take the risk of failing
when by carrying on as before I will probably be rewarded?’ Research has
shown those firms with supportive attitudes to rewards and risk,
and a tolerant attitude towards failure, are more likely to innovate
successfully (Shrivastava and Souder 1987; Gupta and Wileman 1990).

An innovation culture, nurtured by senior management, can visibly support
new product development in general and high-profile projects, and send clear
messages about the role and importance of new product development.
Appropriate rewards should be given to reinforce the value and importance of
people who wish to develop their own ideas, making available funds and
resources for projects, and management should make themselves accessible
when difficult decisions need to be taken (Akgun and Keslin 2021). Google
rewards it employees with time off for innovation success and failures; Google
Glass and driverless cars are examples of past innovations.
MARKETING IN ACTION 10.1
Innovation in Luxury Industries in Europe
Luxury industries drive forward excellent new product development and are key drivers of
growth and jobs. European high-end brands account for more than 70 per cent of the
world’s market, and generate in excess of £800 billion in annual turnover. To generate
income at these levels, firms constantly innovate, and seek opportunities to bring firms
together and foster even greater creative output. Many regional industries across Europe
form clusters of excellence based on specific skills and product expertise. By investing in
skills and innovation, European governments can support and encourage further
development of artistic cultures and inherited craft skills.
Luxury manufacturers invest in long-term strategies; they look for sources of inspiration in
creative style and design innovations, and in innovations emerging from scientific research.
To foster the development of innovations, these firms invest in training facilities and
business development so they can bridge gaps between skills and the needs of their
industry.
Europe has a strong artistic culture that has supported craftsmanship and has been handed
down through generations, but this does not mean luxury businesses are stuck in the past;
they have grown from solid foundations, and have a high capacity for innovation and
creativity.
In an interview, the CEO of Moser (a crystal and glass manufacturer in the Czech Republic)
said: ‘Clusters of excellence [with] craftsmanship based on traditional know-how have
become a significant aspect of European regions’ history and cultural heritage,
and high-end and luxury industries play an important role in the vitality of these
clusters. Czech glass was always regarded as an excellent article of trade, and as an
artefact it has become synonymous with business skills, inventiveness and high quality to
become the product of its country – Czech Republic.’ Moser, founded 160 years ago,
produces unique luxury crystal objects and is one of the country’s leading glass producers.Source: Used by permission of Comite Colbert
In an interview, Andrea Illy, chairman of Illycaffè (Italy), said: ‘Our industries are creative and
innovative par excellence, from products to processes, from manufacturing to distribution,
from communication to business model. And they are cultural industries because they
redefine the tastes and the lifestyles of the world’s most sophisticated consumers – more
than 400 million people, trendsetters who create an imitation process for an even larger
share of the population. Our companies shape the world’s contemporary material culture,
modelling the future. For these reasons, our products are very close to contemporary art.
We’ve been mostly referring to the civilization that was born and evolved in the
Mediterranean area and in Europe.’
The luxury sector is highly competitive and has many firms with a small market share; as a
result, brands are constantly looking to innovate and renew their products and market
position. The nature of this sector gives it a vibrancy that attracts new market entrants,
promotes fair competition and generates sustainable employment opportunities.page 394
Based on: European Cultural and Creative Industries Alliance (2017, 2022)
Finally, management at all levels should resist the temptation of automatic
‘nay-saying’ – that is, whenever a new idea is suggested, there is a tendency
for doubters in a firm to make negative comments and question the feasibility
of the new idea. This does not mean all ideas should immediately be
developed, as each will be scrutinized and has to pass through many stages of
development before becoming a reality. The point is, stifling new ideas at
conception serves only as a constraint on innovation. Managers need to seek
ways to create an innovative culture.
Creative leadership is required to release the passions, imagination and
energy needed for outstanding innovation. Such leadership encourages staff to
reject the status quo and operate in a productive discomfort zone, has a clear
vision of the future, and provides support for exploration (e.g. Apple, Google,
Haier, 3M, Hyundai).
Arguably, there is an underlying assumption that all innovation by
commercial profit-based businesses is for affluent markets where customers
will eventually pay for the research, development and marketing of new
products, and deliver surplus profits by paying high prices for such goods and
services. On the one hand, perhaps this is a reasonable assumption, as more
than half the world’s population survive on less than $2.50 a day, and therefore
are deemed to be uninterested in or unable to purchase innovative products
(Shah 2012). On the other hand, is it a classic example of marketing myopia,
as was suggested by Theodore Levitt in the 1960s (Levitt 1960), whereby
companies are short-sighted about growth opportunities in the market? Read
Mini Case 10.1 to find out more about how a shift towards frugal innovation is
creating innovative products for billions of underserved consumers.
MINI CASE 10.1
Frugal Innovations: From Clay Fridges to Cardboard
Splintspage 395
Creating something from nothing is a growing entrepreneurial phenomenon. Historically,
more than half the world’s population have been ignored by global corporations as a
segment capable of being interested in innovation, but in recent years innovators in such
resource-scarce environments have overcome their many environmental limitations.
According to Eric von Hippel, Professor of Technological Innovation, the key to innovation
comes from customers, not corporate thinking, and everyone has needs that can be
satisfied by new products and services. Frugal innovations – defined as those that offer
basic quality, reduce costs, concentrate on functionality, and show simplicity and
sustainability (Weyrauch and Herstatt 2017; von Janda et al. 2020) – are increasingly being
used to solve complex problems. According to Prahalad and Mashelkar (2010), frugal
innovation or reverse innovation specifically engineers products to meet the needs of
developing countries, for example a rough-terrain wheelchair or a $20 prosthetic knee that
can be assembled in an hour.

Sustained global recession has affected many areas of business, and governments around
the world have taken to using austerity as a watchword for managing national and regional
affairs. This shift in emphasis has profound implications for marketers. Typically, innovation
diffuses from high-income to low-income regions, but frugal innovations diffuse in the
opposite direction. For example, engineers in India won the day with the Tata Nano when
Renault–Nissan asked its engineers in France, India and Japan to come up with some cost￾saving ideas. Haier Group, a Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer, has undercut
western competitors by producing goods ranging from air-conditioning units and washing
machines to wine coolers, often at half the usual cost. This has resulted in Haier taking
significant percentages of US and European markets. However, the shift towards frugal
innovation is more far-reaching than just producing goods for western markets more
cheaply.
In the developing world, the various champions of frugal innovation include Anil Gupta, who
is an academic at one of India’s top business schools, the Indian Institute of Management.
Anil is a champion of individuals who are deemed to be ‘knowledge-rich yet economically
poor’. Anil believes there is a solution to world poverty, but it requires a different approach: a
bottom-up one. He established the Honey Bee Network in the 1980s with the
aim of nurturing innovation, knowledge and creativity at a grassroots level. This
initiative led to the development of a village-to-government approach towards innovation.
Innovation scouts go to rural villages in India looking for potential products to develop.Mansukhbhai Prajapati is one example of a successful entrepreneur who has emerged from
this initiative. He developed the Mitticool brand, which includes clay pans, pressure cookers
and non-electric refrigerators, and which is making a difference to local communities’ health
through better-kept and better-cooked food.
Mohammad Mehtar designed a windmill that cost less than $120 but could irrigate a paddy
field to a sufficient level to grow rice that is more nutritious than that grown using the
conventional production method, making this not only low cost but also more sustainable

Organizing for Innovation and New
Product Development
The second building block of successful new product development and
innovation is an appropriate organization structure. Most firms use one or a
combination of the following methods: project teams, product and brand
managers, new product departments and new product committees.
Project teamspage 396
Project teams involve the bringing together of staff from such areas as
research and development (R&D), engineering, manufacturing, finance and
marketing to work on a new product development project. Research has shown
assigning the responsibility of new product development to such cross￾functional teams has a positive effect on new product performance (Joshi and
Sharma 2004). Specialized skills are combined to form an effective team to
develop the new product concept. Furthermore, if the members of the team
remain stable for the duration of a project, there is greater potential to foster
better decision-making, engender shared responsibility and leverage advantage
from the collective expertise. Ultimately, this approach helps develop better
new product advantage. Working together in stable teams can also help to
avoid ‘tunnel vision’ and inflexibility in problem solving, up to a point.
Slotegraaf and Atuahene-Gima (2011) discuss how stable teams benefit
from better decision-making. However, a key challenge associated with
developing a new product is that innovation requires the conversion of
knowledge into something tangible, and the stability of a product team can
help the process. There is a certain point where the benefits begin to diminish,
so long-term stability beyond a project may be less successful. Google
supported new product development by allowing employees 20 per cent of
their work time to spend on innovative projects. Gmail and AdSense, and
artificial intelligence-driven Smart Compose and Google Assistant, have all
been developed in this manner.
Product and brand managers
Product and brand management entails the assignment of product managers to
product lines (or groups of brands within a product line) and/or of brand
managers to individual brands. These managers are then responsible for the
products’/brands’ success and have the task of coordinating functional areas
(e.g. production, sales, advertising and marketing research). They are also
often responsible for new product development, including the creation of new
product ideas, improving existing products and designing brand extensions.
Product managers may be supported by a team of assistant brand managers and
a dedicated marketing researcher. In some companies, a new product
development manager may help product and brand managers in the task ofgenerating and testing new product concepts. This form of organization is
common for high-volume, relatively low-value products such as groceries and
toiletries, and in the drinks industries.
New product departments and committees
The review of new product projects is normally in the hands of high-ranking
functional managers, who listen to progress reports and decide whether further
funds should be assigned to a project. The functional managers may also be
charged with deciding new product strategies and priorities. It doesn’t matter
whether the underlying structure is a venture team, product and brand
management, or a new product department, a new products committee often
oversees the process and services to give projects a high corporate profile
through the stature of its membership.
The importance of teamwork
Whichever method (or combination of methods) is used, effective cross￾functional teamwork is crucial for success (and there must be effective
communication and teamwork between R&D and marketing. Although all
functional relationships are important during new product development, the
cultural differences involved in innovation projects (e.g. between R&D and
marketing) can be difficult to resolve. The challenge for managers is to ensure
team creativity, resolve discrepancies in intentions, support team members, let
everyone share their ideas, find ways to encourage team members to use gut
feeling and hunches, simplify decision processes, and understand
organizational cultures, hierarchies, social norms and relationships (Akgun and
Keslin 2021).
Innovation leadership
Businesses must encourage innovation, but if they are to achieve sustainable
performance they should also provide management leadership to drive
innovation. Lukoschek et al. (2018) studied the behaviours of 194 firms of
various sizes and from different industries, for example manufacturing, retail,
engineering, IT and construction, and found different approaches towards
fostering idea generation and idea realization. They argued innovation leaders
need to foster two types of management behaviour:page 397
1. Idea generation, which is encouraging the creation and development of new
ideas. A leader should seek to create a supportive working environment in
which individuals and teams can be inspired, open to new ideas and eager to
explore to find new opportunities. However, from a business perspective,
this can be a costly way of working and may impact on units (organizational
success). Nevertheless, leaders should focus on how to develop the creative
knowledge and skills of individuals and teams.
2. Idea realization, which is the implementation of new ideas into marketable
products and services. Leaders need to find ways to ensure the realization
delivers increased value, innovativeness and efficiency. So, a successful
innovation leader should not only encourage creativity and innovative
thinking, but should also do this within the financial and structural
constraints of the organization. Building prototypes that can be tested,
applying ideas in real-world settings and evaluating the process are
important elements of idea realization that need to be managed.
The Lukoschek et al. (2018) study of innovation leadership concluded
these two behaviours require different skills, and yet innovation leaders must
be able to foster both creativity and efficiency if they are to succeed.
Managing Idea Realization (New
Product Development)
There are three inescapable facts about idea realization (new product
development): it is expensive, risky and time-consuming. For example, Gillette
spent in excess of £100 million over more than 10 years developing its Sensor
razor brand. The new product concept was to develop a non-disposable shaver
and use new technology to produce a shaver that would follow the
contours of a man’s face, giving an excellent shave (through two
spring-mounted platinum-hardened chromium blades) with fewer cuts. This
made commercial sense, since shaving systems are more profitable than
disposable razors and allow more opportunity for creating a differential
advantage. Had the brand failed, Gillette’s position in the shaving market
could have been damaged irreparably. Nike is another firm that invests heavily
in new product development to maintain its lead in the specialist sports shoemarket. Read Marketing in Action 10.2 to discover how innovation drives the
Decathlon service brand.
MARKETING IN ACTION 10.2
Innovation Drives Passion Brands and Builds Sporting
Universes at Decathlon
‘Create the need and make the pleasure and the benefits of sport accessible to as many
people as possible’ is the promise Decathlon has offered its clients since 1976. The idea of
‘sport for all’ enabled this French firm to differentiate from other major brands focusing on
competition and performance. This led it to the innovative concept of bringing together all
sports (from cycling to fishing) under one roof and offering a large range of self-service
sport products at the best price. Decathlon continued to develop the business and, in 1999,
opened its first store in the UK and its first Oxylane Village in France – an innovative sports
environment based around a Decathlon store. By 2022, Decathlon had 313 shops and 11
Oxylane Villages in France, and over 2,080 stores in more than 56 different countries.
Worldwide sales are important to the firm as they account for 58 per cent of sales. Central
to the Decathlon offer are its Passion Brands. Each Passion Brand represents a sporting
universe, and collectively they account for more than 60 per cent of Decathlon’s turnover of
€11 billion. See Table 10.3 for examples.

Each Passion Brand conceives the products, which are distributed exclusively by Decathlon
stores. The firm has 20 private-label own-brands and places innovation in sports brands at
the heart of its activities. With a very advanced internal R&D department composed of
researchers, engineers and designers, Decathlon’s international design network is prolific,
producing about 40 patents and nearly 3,000 products each year. The SportsLab is where
designs are tested by teams of professions, athletes and experts, to find out how individuals
react to different settings when using the products.
Domyos is another Passion Brand (dedicated to fitness) and is the best example of the
firm’s willingness to immerse its employees among its customers. Who knows better than
sportspeople what they need to improve their game? Decathlon provides them with a
website dedicated to the co-creation of products, and its Creation platform
invites individuals to submit new product ideas. Anyone can put forward ideas
and participate in projects submitted by members of the community. At each stage of the
creative process – from defining functions to selecting materials or colours, choosing a
name and even the price – users can submit proposals, interact and give their opinions. A
total of 25 prototype workshops are available for teams to observe the behaviour and test
the components of finished products; these help to speed up the design process.
Organizing this innovation culture allows the group to compete with major brands such as
Nike and Adidas, which traditionally highlight their innovation and design.
Based on: Decathlon (2022)
Managing the processes involved efficiently is an important factor in
reducing cost, time and risk. Studies have shown having a formal process with
review points, clear new product goals and a strong marketing orientation
underlying the process leads to greater success, whether the product is a
physical good or a service (de Brentani 1991; Johne and Storey 1998).A basic eight-step new product development process to provide these
characteristics is shown in Figure 10.2 and consists of setting new product
strategy, idea generation, screening, concept testing, business analysis, product
development, market testing and commercialization. Although the reality of
new product development may resemble organizational chaos, the discipline
imposed by the activities carried out at each stage leads to a greater likelihood
of developing a product that not only works but also confers customer benefits.
We should note, however, that new products pass through each stage at varying
speeds; some may dwell at one stage for a long period, while others may pass
through very quickly (Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1986). Furthermore, NPD
project management has become more agile as customers are increasingly
included in the development process. So this may lead to unfinished product
testing, customer feedback being gathered ‘on the fly’, and more flexible
development structures and strategies (Cooper and Sommer 2016).
FIGURE 10.2
The eight-step new product development processNew product strategy
As we have already seen, innovation leaders value strategic guidance from
senior management about their vision and priorities for new product
development. By providing clear guidelines about which products/markets the
firm is interested in serving, senior management staff can provide a focus for
the areas in which idea generation should take place. Also, by outlining their
objectives (e.g. market share gain, profitability, technological leadership) forpage 399
new products they can provide indicators for the screening criteria that should
be used to evaluate those ideas. A key issue in new product strategy is where to
allocate resources. A firm may have several divisions and a multitude of
product lines, so the firm has to decide where funds should be invested.
Idea generation
One of the benefits of developing an innovative corporate culture is it sparks
the imagination (see Marketing in Action 10.2). The objective is to motivate
the search for ideas, so salespeople, engineers, top management, marketers and
other employees are all alert to new opportunities. Interestingly, questioning
Nobel Prize winners about the time and circumstances when they had the
important germ of an idea that led them to great scientific discovery revealed
this can occur at the most unexpected time: just before going to sleep, on
waking up in the morning, or at a place of worship. The common factor seems
to be a period of quiet contemplation, uninterrupted by the bustle of everyday
life and work.
Successful new product ideas are not necessarily based on technological
innovation. Often, they are based on novel applications of existing technology
(e.g. Velcro instead of poppers on disposable nappies). The iPhone created a
need for a place to buy ‘portable music’, which led to the development of the
iTunes store.
The sources of new product ideas can be internal to the firm: scientists,
engineers, marketers, salespeople and designers (as at 3M). Some companies
timetable sessions to think about new ways of doing things, often asking the
question ‘How might we …?’ as a technique to stimulate the creation of ideas,
and use financial incentives to persuade people to put forward the ideas they
have had. At Royal Dutch Shell, virtual teams meet to share ideas. These
sessions have generated many ideas, from ways to reduce paperwork, to using
sophisticated laser sensors to find oil (Viklund 2015).
The prediction by Hamel and Prahalad (1991), that global competitive
battles will be won by firms that have the corporate imagination to build and
dominate fundamentally new markets, has been proved right, especially in
high-tech markets. Often, fundamentally new products/markets are created bysmall businesses that are willing to invent new business models or radically
redesign existing models. Sources of new product ideas can also be external to
the firm. Examining competitors’ products may provide clues to product
improvements. Competitors’ new product plans can be gleaned by training the
sales force to ask distributors about new activities. Distributors can also be a
source of new product ideas directly, since they deal with customers and have
an interest in selling improved products. Another source of externally
generated new product ideas is the millions of scientists, engineers and other
companies globally. By collaborating with them, a firm can gain access to
innovative solutions.
Procter & Gamble (P&G) adopts a rounded approach, focusing on
innovation across the business. Its Growth Works network connects its many
divisions and focuses on building agility in innovations development. Alchemy
is an in-house team of innovation experts working with P&G brands to deliver
the best innovative IT solutions (e.g. programming, user experiences and
security). P&G Ventures works with new businesses and start-up projects
which can help P&G solve consumers’ problems and meet their needs better
than the competition, thereby creating opportunities to build competitive
advantage. Connect + Develop enables P&G to build external partnerships
using online networks to collaborate and accelerate innovation. The
programme practises open innovation, which is a means of accessing
externally developed intellectual property while allowing internally developed
assets and know-how to be used by others. This two-way process has led to
innovation in such areas as technology, engineering, marketing, packaging,
design and business services. For example, Bounce, the world’s first dryer￾aided softener, was created by an independent Canadian inventor. By working
together, this innovative product was patented, licensed and sold throughout
the world. Connect + Develop has a network of creative hubs, joining together
innovators from as far and wide as China, Japan, Europe, and North and South
America. Febreze, which has become a billion-dollar brand for P&G, is
another example of an innovation developed through the Connect + Develop
programme (Procter & Gamble 2018). This business-wide approach to
innovation is referred to as constructive disruption, which means accepting
change as a constant and recognizing the importance of embracing change as a
drive of future business health (Procter & Gamble 2022).
Major sources of good ideas are consumers themselves. Their needs may
not be satisfied by existing products and they may be genuinely interested in
providing ideas that lead to product improvement. Sometimes, traditionalpage 400
marketing research techniques such as focus groups can be useful. Other
companies require a less traditional approach. P&G, for example, has used
ethnographic research, by observing consumers using its products, to develop
new and improved products. Philips has employed anthropologists and
cognitive psychologists to gather insights into the needs and expectations of
consumers around the world. Online, researching blogs and social community
sites can reveal ideas for new products and give insights into the strengths and
weaknesses of existing products, which can lead to improved product
replacements.
In organizational markets, keeping in close contact with customers who are
innovators and market leaders in their own marketplace is likely to be a fruitful
source of new product ideas Marketing research can play a role in providing
feedback when the product line is familiar to customers. However, for
radically new products, customers may be unable to articulate their
requirements, and so conventional marketing research may be ineffective as a
source of ideas. In this situation, as can be seen in Marketing in Action 10.3,
companies need to be proactive in their search for new markets rather than rely
on customer suggestions.
MARKETING IN ACTION 10.3
Creating Radical Innovation
Many new products are incremental, such as Diet Coke from Coca-Cola, or Persil Bio
Action laundry capsules from Unilever; others fundamentally change the nature of a market
and may be based on technological breakthroughs, such as wearable technologies like the
iWatch from Apple, the invention of new business models, such as that of Google, which
freely gives away its core search product for free, or Starbucks’ reinvention of city-centre
coffee drinking. Radical innovation is risky but can bring huge rewards, creating new
markets and destroying old ones. The focus is on making the competition irrelevant by
creating a leap in value for customers, and entering new and uncontested market spaces.Source: dpa picture alliance/Alamy Stock Photo
Avoiding an incremental approach to new product development involves a sharpening of the
corporate imagination to become more alive to new market opportunities. Five factors can
aid this development:
1. Escaping the tyranny of served markets: looking outside markets that are currently
served can be assisted by defining core competences and looking at products/markets
that lie between existing business units. For example, Motorola’s core competences in
wireless technology led it to look beyond current products/markets (e.g. mobile phones)
and towards global positioning satellite receivers.
2. Searching for innovative product concepts: this can be aided by viewing markets as a
set of customer needs and product functionalities. This has led to adding an important
function to an existing product (e.g. Yamaha’s electronic piano), creating a new way to
deliver an existing function (e.g. electronic notepads) or creating a new functionality
(e.g. web browsers, search engines).
3. Weakening traditional price–performance assumptions: traditional price–performance
assumptions should be questioned. For example, the price of drone, or unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs), technology used to provide satellite signals to inaccessible parts, has
fallen dramatically. Originally, this highly sophisticated technology cost thousands of
dollars, but firms like Google and Facebook have been developing low-flying solar￾powered drones to widen internet access in remote locations, and in doing so have
significantly reduced the cost. 3D Robotics is selling UAVs at less than $700.
4. Leading customers: a problem with developing truly innovative products is customers
rarely ask for them. Successful innovating companies lead customers by imagining
unarticulated needs rather than simply following them. They gain insights into incipient
needs by talking in depth to and observing closely a market’s most sophisticated and
demanding customers. For example, Gillette held focus groups with female customers
to find out how often they used its razors. In the focus groups, the women said they
changed their razor blades regularly. However, Gillette carried out an ethnographic
study by going to the homes of the women in the survey. The researchers found the
women regularly forgot to keep a supply of spare blades close to their shower. The
outcome was the launch of the Venus razor with an in-shower blade dispenser making it
more convenient for consumers. This also sold many more razor blades to women.
5. Building a radical innovation hub: a hub is a group of people who encourage and
oversee innovation. It includes idea hunters, idea gatherers, internal venture capitalists,
members of project evaluation committees, members of overseeing boards and
experienced entrepreneurs. The hub’s prime function is to nurture hunters and gatherers
from all over the firm to foster a stream of innovative ideas. Innovation hubs fosteringpage 401
innovation and enterprise have developed across the globe, from Silicon Valley to
Zurich and Helsinki.
The attitudes and practices within innovative firms are also important and help to create a
culture that assists in driving radical innovation. Attitudes include a tolerance for risk-taking
and a future market focus that encourages managers to seek to identify customer needs
through strategic futures research. Key practices are the empowerment of product
champions, which encourages them (supported by resources) to explore research and build
on promising but uncertain future technologies, and the use of generous financial and non￾financial (e.g. recognition and autonomy) rewards for innovative employees.
Technology platforms are helping to accelerate the development of radical new products by
bringing together expert knowledge and innovation potential, creating coordinated
development platforms that enable knowledge from different industries to be pulled together
to create an ‘intelligence explosion’, and radical thinking which identifies opportunities for
creating radical innovations. Once the opportunity is identified, radical new product solutions
can be developed as large technology platforms accumulate significant resources (financial,
technological and information) that leverage advantage from the fundamental research that
has taken place.

(2014); Belton (2015); Chursin et al. (2016); Chursin et al. (2022)
Screening
Having developed new product ideas, these need to be screened to evaluate
their commercial worth. Some companies use formal checklists to help them
judge whether the product idea should be rejected or accepted for further
evaluation. This ensures no important criterion is overlooked. Criteria may be
used that measure the attractiveness of the market for the proposed product,
the fit between the product and firm objectives, and the capability of the firm
to produce and market the product. As the development of innovations
becomes more agile, flexible and speedy, screening and testing can become a
more continual process throughout product development.
Concept testing
Once the new idea has been accepted as worthy of realization it can be
developed into a concept/prototype for initial market testing. Different
versions of the product concepts may be tested with different target customers
to predict the likely success of new products in particular markets (Kotler et al.2015). Products, services and even marketing messages are evaluated in this
way to gain understanding of customer needs. Each variant should be carefully
documented and benchmarked where appropriate. Concept testing allows the
views of customers to enter the new product development process at an early
stage. Firms often use external and independent market research firms to
conduct parts of the testing process. Ipsos (2022) is a global market research
firm, which provides a full range of research services to support NPD; these
include forecasting of innovation appeal, product testing to determine potential
customer response, evaluation of the complete new product or service offer,
and continuous assessment of the user experience.
Other forms of market research include focus group discussion, which can
also be used to develop and test product concepts. The concept may be
described verbally or pictorially so the major features are understood. Potential
customers can then state whether they perceive any benefits accruing from the
features.
Online marketing research is increasingly being used to test concepts,
partly because of its relatively low cost. Companies such as LEGO, BA,
Philips and P&G have set up their own digital communities where they can
test consumers’ reactions to new product concepts.
Considerable ingenuity is needed to research new product concepts. Some
companies, such as Diageo, have developed their own highly innovative
centres for concept testing. Shop Direct’s user experience lab (UX Lab) has
been designed to help develop better understanding of online shoppers at its
websites, for example very.co.uk, isme.co.uk and littlewoods.co.uk. Many
innovations have emerged and contributed to Shop Direct’s online success.
Often, a consideration of buying intentions is a key factor in judging
whether any of the concepts are worth pursuing. In the grocery and toiletries
industries, for example, companies (and their marketing research agencies)
often use ‘action standards’ (e.g. more than 70 per cent of respondents must
say they intend to buy), based on experience, to judge new product concepts.
Concept testing allows a relatively inexpensive judgement to be made by
customers before embarking on a costly product development programme.
Although concept testing is not foolproof, it enables obvious non-starters to be
eliminated early in the process.
Business analysispage 402
Based on the results of the concept test and considerable managerial
judgement, estimates of sales, costs and profits will be made. This is the
business analysis stage. To produce sensible figures, a marketing analysis will
need to be undertaken to identify a suitable target market (or markets), its size
and projected product acceptance over several years. Consideration will be
given to various prices, and the implications for sales revenue (and profits)
discussed. By setting a tentative price, this analysis will provide sales revenue
estimates (see Chapter 9 for a discussion of approaches to pricing).
Costs will also need to be estimated. If the new product is like existing
products (e.g. a brand extension) it should be fairly easy to produce accurate
cost estimates. For radical product concepts, costings may be nothing more
than informal ‘guesstimates’.
Break-even analysis, where the quantity needed to be sold to cover costs is
calculated, may be used to establish whether the project is financially feasible.
Sensitivity analysis, in which variations from given assumptions about price,
cost and customer acceptance, for example, are checked to see how they
impact on sales revenue and profits, can also prove useful at this stage.
Optimistic, most likely and pessimistic scenarios can be drawn up to estimate
the degree of risk attached to the project.
If the product concept appears commercially feasible, this process will
result in marketing and product development budgets being established based
on what appears to be necessary to gain customer awareness and trial, and the
work required to turn the concept into a marketable product.

into reality.
MARKETING IN ACTION 10.4
3D Printers
3D technology is now widely available commercially. 3D printing brings manufacturing to
your desktop. 3D printers create physical replicas of images from computer screens. A 3D
form can be created layer by layer. This technology is being used in different ways:prototyping is enabling many industry sectors to refine existing products and develop
new products faster and more accurately
production allows the manufacturing of a limited quantity of parts and small parts
proof of concept, research and development, and tooling.
Source: BSIP SA/Alamy Stock Photo
Globally, the market for 3D printers is estimated to grow to $83 billion by 2029 as more
practical applications for this new technology emerge, and as advances in technology and
increasing digitization, robotics and AI drive capacity. According to Lisa Harouni (2011), we
are witnessing ‘an industrial revolution in the digital age’. This type of technology is not new;
it has been around for about 20 years, but it is only now the bespoke products built on
demand are beginning to find a niche (but growing) market. There are advantages to this
form of bespoke manufacturing: it is very localized and significantly reduces carbon
footprints, and there is less waste too.
Currently, this technology is increasingly being used to produce body parts and medical
devices. 3D printing is improving efficiency and significantly lowering the cost of production
in the area of medical health. Additionally, the printers produce high-quality products and
have even been used to form face replicas and the soft tissue used in bone grafts.
The aerospace and automotive industries are using 3D printer technology. Boeing uses 3D
printing to manufacture interior parts for its planes, while NASA has used the technology for
rocket engine and satellite parts. Rapid tooling is enabling automotive manufacturers to
customize interiors faster. Fiat Chrysler has developed models that can be used in engine
testing.
The Covid-19 pandemic impacted on the production of 3D printers, causing supply
shortages, however post-pandemic, manufacturers are changing their supply chains and
employing robotics, 5G and AI, and increasing investments in 3D technologies, which is
likely to drive growth in the 3D printing market. Major industrial nations, including the US,
China, India, Korea and the UK, are supporting the development of 3D technology as a
strategy for the development of industry infrastructure.
So, in the future, more physical goods like car parts, jewellery and phone covers will be
available for immediate download in a similar way to how we download music, software and
movies today.

Product development
At this stage, the new product concept is developed into a physical product. As
we have seen, the trend is to move from a situation where this is the sole
responsibility of the R&D and/or engineering department. Multidisciplinary
project teams are established with the task of bringing the product to the
marketplace.
The aim is to integrate the skills of designers, engineers and production,
finance and marketing specialists so product development is quicker, less
costly and results in a high-quality product that delights customers. For
example, the practice of simultaneous engineering means designers and
production engineers work together rather than pass the project from one stage
of development to the next once the first department’s work is finished. Costs
are controlled by a method called target costing. Target costs are worked out
on the basis of target prices in the marketplace and given as engineering/design
and production targets.
Cutting time to market by reducing the length of the product development
stage is a key marketing factor in many industries. This process, known as
virtual engineering, has been used by Fiat, which, when designing its Bravo
and 500 models, chose to rely solely on computer simulations rather than take
the traditional route of making prototypes. This cut the design-to-production
time from 26 to 18 months (Economist 2008). The computerization of
traditional manufacturing plants, the growth of production ecosystems and
24/7 accessibility is underpinning the emergence of the concept Industry 4.0.
Virtual manufacturing and the intelligent factory are enabling the development
of highly sophisticated digital/physical manufacturing plants (see Exhibit
10.2).
EXHIBIT 10.2
Virtual reality meets industrial designSource: Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock
Marketing has an important role to play in the product development stage.
R&D and engineering may focus on the functional aspects of the product,
whereas seemingly trivial factors may have an important bearing on customer
choice. For example, the foam that appears when washing-up liquid is added to
water has no functional value – a washing-up liquid could be produced that
cleans just as effectively but does not produce bubbles. However, the customer
sees the foam as a visual cue that indicates the power of the washing-up liquid.
Marketing needs to keep the project team aware of such psychological factors
when developing the new product. Marketing staff need to make sure that
project team members understand and communicate the important attributes
customers are looking for in the product.
In the grocery market, marketing will usually brief R&D staff on the
product concept, and the latter will be charged with the job of turning the
concept into reality. For example, Yoplait, the French dairy cooperative and
market leader in fruit yoghurts, found through marketing research that a
yoghurt concept based on the following attributes could be a winner:
top-of-the-range dessert
position on a health–leisure scale at the far end of the pleasure range – the
ultimate taste sensation
a fruit yoghurt that is extremely thick and creamy.
This was the brief given to the Yoplait R&D team that had the task of
coming up with recipes for the new yoghurt and the best way of manufacturing
it. The team’s job was to experiment with different cream/fruit combinations to
produce the right product – one that matched the product concept – and to do it
quickly. Time to market was crucial in this fast-moving industry. To help,
Yoplait employed a panel of expert tasters to try out the new recipes andpage 404
evaluate them in terms of texture, sweetness, acidity, colour, smell, consistency
and size of the fruit.
Product testing focuses on the functional aspects of the product and on
consumer acceptance. Functional tests are carried out in the laboratory and in
the field to check such aspects as safety, performance and shelf life. For
example, a car’s braking system must be efficient, a jet engine must be capable
of generating a certain level of thrust, and a food package must be capable of
keeping its contents fresh. Product testing of software products by users is
crucially important in removing any ‘bugs’ that have not been picked up by
internal testers. For example, Google releases new products as ‘betas’
(unfinished versions) so users can check for problems and suggest
improvements (Jarvis 2009).
Market testing
So far in the development process, potential customers have been asked if they
intend to buy the product, but have never been placed in the position of having
to pay for it. Market testing takes measurement of customer
acceptance one crucial step further than product testing by forcing
consumers to ‘put their money where their mouth is’. The basic idea is to
launch the new product in a limited way so consumer response in the
marketplace can be assessed. Two major methods are used: the simulated
market test and test marketing.
The simulated market test can take several forms, but the principle is to set
up a realistic market situation in which a sample of consumers choose to buy
goods from a range provided by the organizing firm, usually a marketing
research firm. For example, a sample of consumers may be recruited to buy
their groceries from a mobile supermarket that visits them once a week. They
are provided with a magazine in which advertisements and sales promotions
for the new product can appear. This method facilitates the measurement of
key success indicators such as penetration (the proportion of consumers that
buy the new product at least once) and repeat purchase (the rate at which
purchasers buy again). If penetration is high but repeat purchase low, buyers
can be asked after trial why they rejected the product. Simulated market tests
are therefore useful as a preliminary to test marketing by spotting problems,
such as in packaging and product formulation, that can be rectified before test
market launch. They can also be useful in eliminating new products that
perform so badly compared with competition in the marketplace that testmarketing is not justified. Indeed, as techniques associated with simulated
market tests become more sophisticated and distributors increasingly refuse to
cooperate in test marketing, simulated market tests have become an attractive
alternative to a full test market (Chisnall 2005).
Test marketing involves the launch of the new product in one or a few
geographical areas chosen to be representative of the intended market. Towns
or television regions are chosen in which the new product is sold into
distribution outlets so performance can be gauged face-to-face with rival
products. Test marketing is the acid test of new product development since the
product is being promoted as it would be during a national launch and
consumers are being asked to choose it against competitor products as they
would if the new product went national. It is a more realistic test than the
simulated market test, and therefore gives more accurate sales penetration and
repeat purchasing estimates. By projecting test marketing results to the full
market, an assessment of the new product’s likely success can be made. But be
aware that sample locations may not be representative of the national market,
and thus sales projections may be inaccurate. Competitors may invalidate the
test market by giving distributors incentives to stock their product, thereby
denying the new product shelf space. Also, test marketing needs to run over a
long enough period to measure the repeat purchase rate for the product, since
this is a crucial indicator of success for many products (e.g. groceries and
toiletries). This can mean a delay in national launch stretching to many months
or even years. In the meantime, more aggressive competitors can launch a rival
product nationally and therefore gain market pioneer advantages.
The advantages of test marketing are that the information it provides
facilitates the ‘go/no go’ national launch decision, and the effectiveness of the
marketing mix elements – price, product formulation/packaging, promotion
and distribution – can be checked for effectiveness. On a global scale, many
international companies roll out products (e.g. cars and consumer electronics)
from one country to another. In so doing, they are gaining some of the benefits
of test marketing in that lessons learned early on can be applied to later
launches.
Commercialization
Commercialization involves taking a firm’s new products and services and
focusing marketing activities on sharing knowledge of the benefits to potential
users. Activities may include demonstrations, advertising, brand development,page 405
promotional events, and ensuring successful distribution and delivery of said
products and services (Aarikka-Stenroos and Sandberg 2012). When
developing a commercialization strategy it is important to consider how
customers may respond to a new product or service.
Developing a commercialization strategy for a new product
An effective commercialization strategy relies upon marketing management
making clear choices regarding the target market (where it wishes to compete),
and the development of a marketing strategy that provides a differential
advantage (how it wishes to compete). These two factors define the new
product positioning strategy, as discussed in Chapter 19.
A useful starting point for choosing a target market is an understanding of
the diffusion of innovation process (Rogers 2003). This explains how a new
product spreads throughout a market over time. Particularly important is the
notion that not all people or organizations who make up the market will be in
the same state of readiness to buy the new product when it is launched. In
other words, different actors in the market will have varying
degrees of innovativeness – that is, their willingness to try
something new. Figure 10.3 shows the diffusion of innovation curve, which
categorizes people or organizations according to how soon they are willing to
adopt the innovation.
FIGURE 10.3
The diffusion of innovation processThe curve shows those actors (innovators and early adopters) who were
willing to buy the new product soon after launch are likely to form a minor
part of the total number of actors who will eventually be willing to buy it. As
the new product is accepted and approved by these customers, and the decision
to buy the new product therefore becomes less risky, so the people that make
up the bulk of the market, comprising the early and late majority, begin to try
the product themselves. Finally, after the product has gained full market
acceptance, a group suitably described as the laggards adopt the product.
By the time the laggards have begun buying the product, the innovators
and early adopters have probably moved on to something new.
These diffusion of innovation categories have a crucial role to play in the
choice of target market. The key is to understand the characteristics of the
innovator and early adopter categories and target them at launch. Simply
thinking about the kinds of people or organizations that are more likely to buy
a new product early after launch may suffice. If not, marketing research can
help. To stimulate the thinking process, Rogers suggests the following broad
characteristics for each category (Rogers 2003). It is important to note this is
an introduction to this theory; you should read about the impact of technology
and the ‘big bang effect’ in Chapter 19.
Innovators: these are often venturesome and like to be different; they are
willing to take a chance with an untried product. In consumer markets they
tend to be younger, better educated, more confident and more financially
affluent, and, consequently, can afford to take a chance on buying something
new. In organizational markets, they tend to be larger and more profitable
companies if the innovation is costly, and have more progressive, better￾educated management. They may themselves have a good track record in
bringing out new products and may have been the first to adopt innovations
in the past. As such, they may be easy to identify.
Early adopters: these are not quite so venturesome; they need the comfort of
knowing someone else has taken the early risk. But they soon follow their
lead. They still tend to have similar characteristics to the innovator group,
since they need affluence and self-confidence to buy a product that has not
yet gained market acceptance. They, together with the innovators, can be
seen as opinion leaders who strongly influence other people’s views on the
product. As such, they have a major bearing on the success of the product.
One way of looking at the early adopters is they filter the products accepted
by the innovator group and popularize them, leading to acceptance by most
buyers in the market (Zikmund and D’Amico 1999).page 406
Early and late majorities: these form the bulk of the customers in the
market. The early majority are usually deliberate and cautious in their
approach to buying products. They like to see products prove themselves on
the market before they are willing to part with cash for them. The late
majority are even more cautious and possibly sceptical of new products.
They are willing to adopt only after most people or organizations have tried
the products. Social pressure may be the driving force moving them to
purchase.
Laggards: these are tradition-bound people. The innovation needs to be
perceived almost as a traditional product before they will consider buying it.
In consumer markets, they are often the older and less well-educated
members of the population.
By understanding the characteristics of each stage of adoption it becomes
possible to extract meaningful insights for marketing planning. At
introduction, innovators buy the product, followed by early adopters as the
product enters the growth phase. Growth is fuelled by the early and late
majority, and stable sales during the maturity phase may be due to
repurchasing by these groups. Laggards may enter the market during late
maturity or even decline. Thus promotion designed to stimulate trial may need
to be modified as the nature of new buyers changes over time.
The second key decision for commercialization is the choice of marketing
strategy to establish a differential advantage. The approach will be dependent
on the characteristics of the target market and the type of new product or
service. As we have seen, the characteristics of customers affect the rate of
adoption of an innovation, and marketing’s job is to identify and target those
with a high willingness to adopt upon launch. The characteristics of the
product being launched also affect the diffusion rate and have marketing
strategy implications (see Figure 10.4).
What is the differential advantage of the new product compared with
existing products? This will affect the speed of adoption. The more added
customer benefits a product gives to a customer, the more customers will be
willing to buy (see Chapter 18 for further discussion of how to create a
differential advantage).page 407
What is the innovation’s compatibility with consumers’ values, experiences,
lifestyles and behaviours? The congruence between mobile phones and the
lifestyles of many young people helped their diffusion. The iPhone’s rapid
diffusion was also aided by such compatibility. The new product also needs
to be compatible with consumers’ behaviour. The iPhone 2G launched in
2007 was a new product technology and, although smartphones are part of
our everyday lives today, diffusion was initially slow because its adoption
required significant behaviour change. A study looking at the variables
influencing the adoption of smartphones found age, lifestyle, ease of use,
familiarity with technology, and fashion to be important predictors of likely
adoption (Sarrina Li 2014).
What is the innovation’s complexity? Products and services that are difficult
to understand or use may take longer to be adopted. For example, Apple
launched its Macintosh computer backed by the proposition that existing
computers were too complex to gain widespread adoption. By making its
model more user-friendly, Apple gained fast adoption among the large
segment of the population repelled by the complexity of using computers.
To what extent can the product or service be tried/experimented with? This
also affects its speed of diffusion. This is called divisibility and refers to the
degree to which the product can be tried on a limited basis. Inexpensive
products can be tried without risk of heavy financial loss. The rapid
diffusion of Google was aided by the fact its functionality could be accessed
free of charge. This mode of diffusion has been adopted by many high-tech
products, for example Facebook, Twitter and Gmail.
What is the innovation’s communicability? Adoption is likely to be faster if
the benefits and applications of the innovation can be readily observed or
described to target customers. If product benefits are long term or difficult to
quantify, then diffusion may take longer. For example, Skoda’s attempt to
produce more reliable cars took time to communicate, as buyers’ acceptance
of this claim depended on their long-term experience of driving the cars. In
service industries, marketing innovations like providing more staff to
improve the quality of service are hard to quantify in financial terms (i.e.
extra revenue generated) and therefore have a low adoption rate by
the management of some companies. The marketing implications
are that marketing management must not assume what is obvious to them
will be clear to customers. They need to devise a communications strategy
that allows potential customers to become aware of the innovation, and to
understand and be convinced of its benefits.FIGURE 10.4
How the characteristics of a product affects its rate of diffusion
Product replacement strategies
Commercialization of new products is not the only strategy in this field as
product replacement is the most common form of new product introduction. A
study of the marketing strategies used to position product replacements in the
marketplace found eight approaches based on a combination of product change
and other marketing modifications (i.e. marketing mix and target market
changes) (Saunders and Jobber 1994). Figure 10.5 shows the eight replacement
strategies used by companies.
1. Facelift: minor product change with little or no change to the rest of the
marketing mix or target market. Cars are often given facelifts midway
through their lifecycle by undergoing minor styling alterations, for example.
Chinese and Japanese companies constantly use facelifts for current
electronic products such as cameras, LCD-screen and smart televisions,
tablet and laptop computers, and smartphones by changing product features,
a process known as product churning.
2. Inconspicuous technological substitution: major technological change with
little or no alteration of the other elements of the marketing mix. The
technological change is not brought to the consumer’s attention, a strategy
often used by washing powder manufacturers, where the improvedperformance rather than the technological change is brought to the
consumers’ attention (e.g. Skip intelligent liquid detergent, marketed in
South Africa, which has Fibre Protect technology).
3. Remerchandising: a modification of name, promotion, price, packaging
and/or distribution, while maintaining the basic product. For example,
Danone’s Bio yoghurt changed to Activia; Jif cleaning products were
rebranded as Cif; Orange mobile became Everything Everywhere (EE) in
the UK when it merged with T-Mobile (see Exhibit 10.3).
4. Relaunch: both the product and other marketing mix elements are changed.
Relaunches are common in the car industry, where, every four to five years,
a model is replaced with an upgraded version. Sky relaunched its Sky 1, 2
and 3 channels as Sky Atlantic, Sky Living and Sky HD. Sky Living was
subsequently rebranded to Sky Witness, to better reflect the programming of
the channel and the introduction of more crime dramas.
5. Conspicuous technological substitution: a major technological change is
accompanied by heavy promotional and other mix changes to stimulate
awareness and trial. An example is the replacement of the Rover Mini with
the BMW Mini, which, despite remaining faithful to the character of the
original, is technologically a fundamentally different car.
6. Intangible repositioning: the basic product is retained, but other mix
elements and target customers change. When Mexican fast food restaurant
chain Taco Bell (owned by Yum Brands!) began to experience declining
sales and profits, and a growing number of competitors, it revived the brand
with a new slogan, ‘Live Mas’ (live more), and introduced upmarket
locations with redesigned restaurants, to give its 18–35-year-old target
customers an experience more akin to eating in a Mexican cantina. The
slogan has become so important to the brand it is at the centre of its business
philosophy, enriching the lives of customer and employees (Hyman 2018).
Taco Bell continues to use this positioning but constantly adapts its
advertising to be ‘in the moment’ with its target audiences. The brand also
uses influencer marketing, for example its ‘Beautiful Mess’ campaign
encouraged fans to share stories of the messiness of eating its tacos
(AdNews 2022).
7. Tangible repositioning: both the product and target market change. Škoda is
an example of a product being significantly improved to appeal to a more
upmarket, wealthier target market.8. Neo-innovation: a fundamental technology change accompanied page 408
by target market and mix changes. For example, Samsung’s move
into the sustainable energy market has seen the development of new
technology for new target customers.

Companies, therefore, face an array of replacement options with varying
degrees of risk. Figure 10.5 categorizes these options and provides an aid to
strategic thinking when considering how to replace products in the
marketplace.

Commercializing technology
Superior commercialization of technology continues as a key success factor in
many industries. Some firms make a significant commitment to developing the
capability to bring sophisticated high-tech products to market faster than other
firms and treat the commercialization process in a less disciplined manner. For
example, Volkswagen is making significant investment in electric vehicle
technology and batteries to develop vehicles that can meet future market
demand, as it expects EVs to overtake combustion engines by 2030
(Volkswagen Group 2022). Samsung spent more than €13 billion on R&D into
smart televisions and other advanced projection devices. Intel spends more
than $13 billion on R&D to keep pace with demand for ever-increasing
computing power and performance of computing solutions. It aims to become
a leading player in the semiconductor industry to compete with Qualcomm.
Qualcomm has also been investing in innovations and making acquisitions of
innovative start-up firms to boost its product portfolio, support its expansion
into automotive technology and IoT computing, and maintain its market
leadership in mobile and wireless technologies (McGregor and Tirias Research
2022).
Marketing’s input in such situations is to provide insight into how the
technology may provide customer benefits within a prescribed target market.
For example, as already discussed, traditional marketing research techniques
have only a limited role to play when using technology to create new markets;
this is because people find it difficult to articulate their views on unfamiliar
subjects, and acceptance may come only over time (the diffusion of
innovation). The marketing of technological innovations, therefore, calls for a
blend of technology and marketing.
Martech is a growing marketplace, where the boundaries between
marketing and technology firms are becoming very blurred. There are
currently six distinct sectors, with numerous specific activity areas. Table 10.4
shows examples of the areas of business activity where marketing and
technology are inseparable. In 2011, there were just 150 firms listed in the
martech sector; this had grown to 5,000 by 2017 and approaching 10,000 by
2022 (Martech 2022). Marketing managers wishing to navigate this highly
complex landscape should stick to some basic marketing principles:page 409
focus on what is needed, not the latest cool gizmo
get buy-in from all stakeholders who are likely to engage with the latest
technology application(s) needed
ask for advice – seek recommendations from within the relevant industry
evaluate these recommendations
monitor cost of purchase, running costs and future costs.

Chapter
 Detailed Reviewpage 411
1. What is an innovation and what is a new product?
Innovation is the process of translating an idea into a product or service;
innovative products are those that can reshape markets and reconfigure marketing
environments.
New products are much less revolutionary and tend to be incremental
improvements. They fall into six broad types: product development replacements,
cost reduction, improvements, product line extensions, new product lines and new￾to-the-world products.
2. How to create and nurture an innovative culture
Creating and nurturing an innovative culture can be achieved by rewarding
success heavily, tolerating a certain degree of failure, and senior management
sending clear messages about the role and importance of innovation. Their words
should be supported by allowing staff time off to develop their own ideas, making
resources available, being accessible when difficult decisions need to be taken,
and resisting automatic nay-saying.
3. The organizational options applying to innovations and new product
development
The options are project teams, product and brand managers, and new product
departments and committees. Whichever method is used, effective cross￾functional teamwork is essential for successful innovation leadership.
4. Managing idea realization (new product development)
Idea realization and new product development is expensive, risky and
time-consuming. Managing the process effectively is important, as is controlling
budgets, production time and lowering risk. There is an eight-step new product
development process, which consists of setting new product strategy, idea
generation, screening, concept testing, business analysis, product development,
market testing and commercialization.
5. The new product development process
A formal process with review points, clear new product goals and a strong
marketing orientation underlying the process leads to greater success.
The stages are new product strategy (senior management should set objectives
and priorities), idea generation (sources include customers, competitors,
distributors, salespeople, engineers and marketers), screening (to evaluate the
ideas’ commercial worth), concept testing (to allow the views of target customers
to enter the process early), product development (where the concept is developed
into a physical product for testing), market testing (where the new product is tested
in the marketplace) and commercialization (where the new product is launched).
6. Commercialization
Commercialization involves three issues:
1) Developing a commercialization strategy, which involves selecting target
markets and understanding the diffusion of innovation categories and their
marketing implications. The categories are innovators, early adopters, early
and late majorities, and laggards. The marketing implications are that the
categories can be used as a basis for segmentation and targeting (initially thepage 412
innovators/early adopters should be targeted). As the product is bought by
different categories, so the marketing mix may need to change. The speed of
adoption can be affected by marketing activities – for example, advertising to
create awareness, sales promotion to stimulate trial, and educating users in
product benefits and applications. The nature of the innovation itself can also
affect adoption – that is, the strength of its differential advantage, its
compatibility with people’s values, experiences, lifestyles and behaviours, its
complexity, its divisibility and its communicability.
2) Product replacement strategies – deciding when it is appropriate to introduce a
new form of an existing product.
3) Commercializing technology, innovative technology firms are constantly
developing new products and tend to have significant R&D budgets. The
marketing of technology products calls for a blend of technology and
marketing. This blend has given rise to a whole new industry sector called
martech. This sector is growing in terms of complexity and types of activity and
the number of firms.

DRIVING ELECTRIC CAR
INNOVATION:
INFLUENCING FACTORS
OF TESLA’S PRICING
STRATEGY
Introduction
Tesla, Inc., formerly known as Tesla Motors from 2003 until 2017, is an American company that
manufactures electric vehicles, solar panels, batteries for vehicles and homes, and home power
storage systems. Tesla’s mission statement is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable
energy. Tesla was founded in 2003 by American engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc
Tarpenning. The company was given its name in honour of the inventor Nikola Tesla, who was
of Serbian and American descent (Schreiber and Gregersen 2022). Since its inception, the
company has secured funding from a variety of sources, most notably PayPal co-founder Elon
Musk. In 2004, Musk became the largest shareholder of the company, investing more than $30
million and serving as Tesla’s chairman (Schreiber and Gregersen 2022). Although they
remained as shareholders and advisers, in late 2007 Eberhard and Tarpenning left the
company. In 2008, Elon Musk took over as CEO.page 416

Although the last decade has been turbulent due the global pandemic, financial crisis and parts
shortages that have impeded production in both the US and China, Tesla has managed to put
electric vehicles on the map and become the most valuable car company in the world. In 2022,
Tesla celebrated its 12th year as a public company and was valued at $1 trillion. This case
study discusses the pricing strategies adopted by Tesla as it transitioned from the luxury to
mainstream electric vehicle market.
Challenges for Tesla
Today, Tesla has positioned itself as a global leader in the design, development and
manufacturing of electric cars, in particular the sports automobile. However, over the years, the
company has faced significant challenges. In 2008, Tesla encountered immense pressure due
to the global financial crisis. As a result, Musk fired about 25 per cent of the staff and pushed
back the launch date of the Tesla Roadster, its first completely electric car. The Roadster
boasted the longest range of any electric vehicle on the market, with power and performance to
rival many gasoline-powered sports cars, while producing zero tailpipe emissions (Schreiber
and Gregersen 2022).
In 2010, Tesla went public, raising around $226 million. In 2012, the company ceased
production of the Roadster and switched to the Model S, again to critical acclaim. The Model S
represented Tesla’s first foray into the mass consumer market. In the same year, the company
developed charging stations across Europe and the US, called Superchargers, to promote high￾speed charging for its cars at no extra cost to Tesla car owners (Schreiber and Gregersen
2022).
In 2016, the company opened the first of its ‘Gigafactories’, in which it produced car batteries
and vehicles. This was followed, in 2018, by the launch of Tesla’s range of solar panels and,
reflecting the fact that it no longer sold only cars, the company changed its name from Tesla
Motors to Tesla, Inc.
The company ran into turbulent times again in 2018, with sharply declining share prices due to
its inability to produce cars on the scale previously promised. The company had pledged itcould produce and ship more than 5,000 cars per week, but shipped only 2,400 in a three￾month period. This, and other issues such as some ill-advised Twitter activity from Musk,
triggered the US Department of Justice to investigate whether Tesla had been misleading
investors with claims about production capabilities. Ultimately, a deal was reached whereby
Musk had to step down as chairman of the board. Since then, the company has released
several new car models and adapted its pricing strategies accordingly.
Tesla’s Sales and Pricing Strategy
At the start of his career as Tesla CEO, Elon Musk published a blog post (Musk 2006) in which
he set out the fundamental pricing strategy for Tesla Motors. In the post, he suggested that
Tesla’s pricing strategy involves high price points on the basis of uniqueness or high value
attributed to the company’s products. As Tesla products are considered advanced in terms of
technology and ecology, consumers are willing to pay relatively high prices for them. However,
as stated by Musk, the fundamental strategy is to:
Build sports car
Use that money to build an affordable car
Use that money to build an even more affordable car
While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options
True to his word, in 2008 the company started by building and selling its Tesla Roadster – a
high-spec, high-speed electric roadster. The Tesla Roadster, while fulfilling requirements for
American federal tax relief of $7,500, had a price tag of $109,000, which classified it as a luxury
item.
With the premium market in hand, Tesla turned its attention to other segments and adopted a
price skimming strategy when it launched the Model S in 2012. While the Model S had a
relatively high price tag, the company subsidized the cost of the vehicle through the introduction
of its supercharger network in the US, combined with federal ($7,500) and state ($6,000–
$8,000) tax incentives, and predicted fuel savings over the lifetime of the vehicle. Essentially,
Tesla owners could avail themselves of free charging/long-distance travel across the US. This
was a key strategy for the company. Although consumers could purchase from Tesla
competitors such as Hyundai, the lack of support in terms of charging points for electric
vehicles globally made this a less compelling option for many (Amariei 2022). Due to public
demand for less expensive models, the Model 3 was launched in 2017 for the very affordable
price of $35,000. This went on to become the bestselling electric car of all time, surpassing
even the Nissan Leaf (Reed 2020), followed by the Model Y in 2020.
However, more recently, from 2021, the picture has changed, with Tesla increasing prices
month on month by an average of 5–8 per cent annually across its full vehicle range. Although
there was much speculation internationally about this change, Musk explained that the price
hikes were a response to global supply chain issues arising from the pandemic, such as price
increases in copper, aluminium and steel (Lambert 2021).
Looking to the future, the company plans to re-target the higher-end premium market, predicted
for 2023, with the launch of the second-generation Tesla Roadster. This will have a price tag in
the region of $200k, with a limited ‘Founders’ edition priced at $250k (Dorian 2022).page 417
Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV) as a Profitability
Driver
Tesla has always promoted itself as a champion of carbon neutrality, particularly in relation to
the production of zero emission vehicles (ZEV). In an unusual move, and one that many
claimed was tone deaf, Musk announced on Twitter in March 2021 that customers could now
purchase a Tesla using bitcoin (the first cryptocurrency). Analysts at the time noted that
enabling consumers to use bitcoin equated to creating the carbon output of ‘60 internal
combustion engine cars’ for every Tesla sold (Powell 2021). This is because bitcoin technology
relies heavily on bitcoin mining, a process that consumes vast amounts of energy, which is
generated to a large extent by coal power. Bowing to international pressure and commentary,
Tesla quickly backtracked and announced it would no longer accept bitcoin (Bansal 2021).
Since then, Musk has indicated that the company will resume accepting bitcoin when it can be
verified that at least 50 per cent clean energy is used to mine it (NDTV 2021).
Deeply embedded in Tesla’s pricing strategy is the leveraging of regulatory credits in the US,
China and the EU. In an effort to cut down on carbon emissions, governments around the world
have given automakers incentives to make electric cars or cars that emit very little
carbon. Credits are given to car companies that make and sell vehicles that are
good for the environment. In the US, for example, automakers are required to make a certain
number of so-called zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) based on how many cars are sold.
Automakers that make these cars will get credits based on things such as how far a car can go;
ZEVs with longer ranges get more credits. Each year, these carmakers must have a certain
number of regulatory credits. If they can’t reach the goal, they can buy credits from other
companies that have more than they need. Since Tesla only sells electric cars that qualify as
ZEVs, the company always has more regulatory credits than it needs and can sell them at 100
per cent profit. To quantify this, in the first quarter of 2021, Tesla sold $518 million in regulatory
credits. In April 2022, Tesla’s Q1 income from carbon credit sales had increased by 25 per cent
compared to the same period in 2021 (Jennifer L 2022). Analysts are predicting that this
financial model will be short-lived however, as other car manufacturers are continuously
improving their emissions and so are becoming less reliant on purchasing credits from
companies like Tesla (Kharpal 2021). Musk has stated that this profitable business of selling
carbon credits has enabled the company to drive down manufacturing costs, and therefore
prices of its EV fleet, while increasing investment in innovation which will greatly improve the
environmental characteristics of the EV market (Kolodny 2020).
The Musk Brand: Good, Bad and Dangerous?
Elon Musk has a significant impact on the Tesla brand. To some he is seen as an almost
Godlike figure, appealing to the high-tech community globally for his vision and
entrepreneurship. This has in some part accounted for the rush by consumers to purchase
Tesla products. However, in recent years it has been suggested that Musk’s behaviours are
heavily damaging Tesla’s brand equity, creating a scenario where consumers are losing trust in
the brand as they lose respect for its figurehead. This could have serious consequences for the
company – one that, famously, is vehemently opposed to advertising.
Examples of Musk’s behaviours include his downplaying of Covid-19, saying that it has little risk
for people. In another instance, on Twitter, he challenged Vladimir Putin to a single-combat
fight, with Ukraine as the stake. These instances created a perception of disrespect for families
struggling with the loss of loved ones due to Covid, and to the people of Ukraine in general.page 418
Additionally, Musk has often made seemingly spontaneous about-turns on important company
decisions (such as the change in strategy about bitcoin) which, when combined with other
behaviours, cause some to question his judgement and suitability to head Tesla (Turner 2022).
In 2022, Musk claimed that the company might start an advertising campaign in order to
counter the brand-related negativity on social media (Lambert 2022). Musk also announced that
Tesla is going to make a new futuristic-looking electric vehicle as a ‘dedicated robotaxi’, so as to
truly break away from its competitors once and for all.

LOUIS VUITTON: A
TIMELESS SUCCESS IN
PREMIUM PRICING
Louis Vuitton (commonly known as LV) is among the world’s most recognizable luxury brands,
renowned for its association with high-end leather products, legendary steamer trunks,
distinctive monogram handbags, exquisite timepieces and jewels, and cutting-edge fashion.
Founding the company in 1854, French fashion designer Louis Vuitton utilized his excellent
craftsmanship to design the world’s most sought-after emblem. Prior to that, he had started his
career creating trunks for Napoleon III’s wife, Empress Eugénie de Montijo, and it was at the
age of 33 that he founded his own artisanal shop at 4 rue Neuve-des-Capucines. Thus came to
fruition the beginnings of this much-lauded brand.

Over the years, Louis Vuitton has launched some of the most iconic bags in the world, such as
the Speedy handbag and the Neverfull tote. In 1997, the business began to develop women’s
apparel and, three years later, extended to men’s clothing too. Today, LV is the world’s most
valuable luxury brand (estimated at $33 billion) (Simpson Group 2022) and the most searched
luxury brand on the internet (Halliday 2022). Although LV has been hit hard by plagiarism,
counterfeit products and newer, more innovative, luxury brands like Balenciaga and Gucci, the
company has been able to maintain its dominant position in the luxury consumer market by
adhering to a premium pricing strategy that represents originality, creativity and durability in its
products.
A Premium ‘Investment’ for a Fine Product
A premium pricing strategy entails pricing the company’s items more expensively than those of
its competitors. It seeks to build positive and unique brand perceptions in terms of the quality of
the company’s product line. However, for a company’s products (whether physical or intangible)
to be successful, they must have unique attributes mixed with a better brand image, which is
typically the case with luxury businesses. Several elements, including Louis Vuitton’s quality,
durability and uniqueness, have aided its premium pricing approach.
Quality has always been at the heart of all Louis Vuitton products. The company makes items
that are extraordinary in terms of design and craftsmanship, as it has since its inception.
Despite rising customer demand, the company continues to depend on specialized and
experienced employees to handcraft its renowned leather-based items (handbags, wallets,
belts and shoes) with the utmost care, in order to stimulate consumers’ thoughts towards the
item being ‘crafted especially for you’. To ensure exceptional fabrication quality, the crafting
process is carried out exclusively in-house. Importantly, the company takes pride in choosing
the highest-quality leather, which makes its items sturdy and long-lasting. This commitment to
quality transformed customers’ perceptions from purchasing these products for consumption
into a long-term investment. As a result, people are willing to spend a fortune on Louis Vuitton
items since they believe they will last a long time.
Another key to the success of Louis Vuitton’s premium pricing strategy is design exclusivity.
Many of its products make use of the brown Damier and Monogram Canvas fabrics, which have
been popular since the nineteenth century. The renowned LV initials appear on all of the
company’s products, making them readily recognized. Nonetheless, Louis Vuitton has always
attempted to combat mass manufacture with limited-edition collections and low stock quantities.
The brand employs the scarcity principle of economics, which states that the price of an item
may rise when supply is limited and demand is strong. Louis Vuitton ensures that consumers
sign up to a long waiting list to purchase a specific design, making it more desirable over time.
Using the psychological method of ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO), Louis Vuitton entices its
customers by instilling in them an enthusiasm and urgency to have a product
regardless of price. When a consumer can eventually purchase a product, this
engenders in them sentiments of exclusivity (having a product that not everyone can have),
which boosts their brand loyalty over time.
Originality and innovativeness are strong drivers of Louis Vuitton’s success. The brand
continually reinvents itself, with original collaborations that ensure its classic products remain in
fashion. Over the years, it has worked with artists and designers such as Jeff Koons, Takashi
Murakami and Pharrell Williams, who have all created their own limited-edition lines. Recently,
the brand collaborated with famous sportswear company Nike to create an exclusive series ofits famous Air Force 1 shoe, which retails at almost ten times the price of the original Air Force
1. Such collaborations have extended Louis Vuitton’s presence in the market through giving it
appeal to the new millennial generation, which is ‘sport-casual’ oriented, while still charging
them the price of a luxury item.
Storming Through Challenges
The exclusivity of Louis Vuitton’s designs, combined with its hard-to-get approach, has resulted
in an ongoing counterfeiting problem. With enthusiastic buyers striving for the limited-edition
designs, others took advantage of the chance to make counterfeit Louis Vuitton products. With
quality ranging from second copy and first copy to master replica, Louis Vuitton has constantly
had to fight for its brand image and reputation. The company’s loyal customers were
dissatisfied with the decrease in exclusivity of Louis Vuitton products for which they had paid a
high price after the brand became the world’s most counterfeited luxury product (Crudele 2019).
To compound these problems, Louis Vuitton faced allegations of selling counterfeit products at
its own outlets in China after a consumer reported purchasing a ‘fake’ handbag from a store
employee (Zhang 2022). Despite refuting the charges, Louis Vuitton’s reputation for quality
remains at risk, with the company instituting a zero-tolerance policy with regard to counterfeiting
in order to preserve both its consumers and its intellectual property.

The challenges for Louis Vuitton did not end with the producers of counterfeit goods, however,
with luxury brands such as Balenciaga, Off-White and Gucci taking advantage of the
counterfeiting issue and introducing unique and modern designs to match current fashion
trends. Their new designs received support from collaborations with musicians and social
media influencers, who turned these brands into ‘must haves’ for the luxury status quo. In turn,
these brands have stimulated a lifestyle feeling for consumers that extends beyond the classic
designs of Louis Vuitton. In response to this, Louis Vuitton launched collaborations with various
artists to fight off the competition by introducing new models with bold LV monograms to appeal
to current fashion sensibilities.page 421

Towards Continued Success
The simplicity and boldness of the LV monogram is immediately identifiable by individuals of all
ages and cultures. Incorporating excellent quality, exclusivity and innovation, Louis Vuitton has
found the right formula for success with a premium pricing strategy. However, to maintain this
approach, Louis Vuitton will have to figure out solutions to fight the counterfeit products that are
giving hope to those other brands seeking to overturn its status as ‘world’s most popular luxury
brand’.
Questions
1. Discuss the benefits of the scarcity principle and ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) for Louis
Vuitton’s brand.
2. How can Louis Vuitton fight the counterfeiters and maintain its exclusivity? Suggest
alternative marketing options.
3. Critically evaluate the ethical issues associated with the premium pricing model.

his chapter discusses the marketing of services and how they deliver
value. Throughout this text we adopt the stance that physical products and
service products are equally important in terms of marketing requirements.
It is also essential to be aware of how principles of marketing apply to
services. In addition to the Four-Ps, the marketing of services requires
understanding of the services marketing mix. Furthermore, it is important to be
aware of how superior value is created in the service industries by bringingtogether a firm and its customers in the value creation process. This approach
has been called service-dominant logic; it focuses marketers’ attention on the
creation of value and the importance of relationships, in contrast to the
traditional model of marketing which has the exchange of manufactured goods
as its dominant logic. From this point of view, marketers should think about
how best to manage and co-create value with customers. This means
developing long-term relationships that are mutually beneficial (Karpen et al.
2012). The management of customer relationships is discussed in detail in
Chapter 5.
Services become increasingly valuable to industrialized economies as
advances in technology lead to the development of sophisticated products that
require more design, production and maintenance services. Another reason for
the rising contribution of services to the global economy is growth in per
capita income. This gives citizens a greater percentage of their income to
spend on non-essentials such as restaurant meals and national and international
travel, which are all service-intensive products. Greater discretionary income
increases demand for financial services such as investment trusts and personal
pensions. It is not just in the consumer sector where there is an increase in
demand for services. In industrial sectors, the trend towards outsourcing means
manufacturers are buying in services. Often it is more efficient for a business
to use external expertise to manage distribution, warehousing and catering,
leaving time to focus on its core competences. Deregulation has also increased
the level of competition in certain service industries (e.g. telecommunications,
broadcasting, airlines) and this has also been a driver of the expansion of
services.
To give you an idea of the significance of the services industry in
significant economies around the world, Table 11.1 shows the percentage each
sector (industrial, agricultural and service) contributes to the GDP of each
country listed. In the US, UK and France, services contribute close to 80 per
cent of GDP. In addition, public administration and other services industries,
including work carried out in private households, contribute to the service
economies.
TABLE 11.1 Contribution of industrial, agricultural and service industry sectors to GDPpage 425

The Service Industries
The sectors making up the service industries vary considerably and are
constantly evolving as new service concepts are developed, for example web
developers and social media engagement analysts. Various forces are driving
the changes, such as technological innovations and changing patterns of
ownership. For example, privatization of parts of the UK National Health
Service created opportunities for private service providers to perform medical
scans and carry out diagnostic tests and X-rays on patients (Campbell 2015).
The ‘servitization’ of products is also encouraging firms to rethink their
business strategies. This approach has created many opportunities for firms to
extend their ‘product’ sales by selling wraparound services complementing the
original sale. For example, industrial equipment manufacturers regularly
provide add-on support services, which can extend relationships. Baines and
Lightfoot (2013) found some pioneering companies (e.g. Rolls￾Royce, Xerox, London Underground) were undergoing a
transformation in their business strategies, and pushing service performance
helped these and other firms create competitive advantage by developing
customer intimacy (detailed knowledge of customer requirements) so they
could produce operational excellence (controlling processes) through
delivering the best solutions and product leadership (selling the best products
on the market). As a result, these authors classified services as Basic
(providing products), Intermediate (repair, maintenance and customer help)
and Advanced (flexible payment solutions, fleet management, collaborative
integrated solutions), and suggested each class provides a pathway for firms todevelop their own servitization strategies, which transcend boundaries between
products and services.
Bronzovic and Tregua (2022) suggest overtime services have become more
than a strategy to add value, build relationships and co-create value (between
the service user and provider), and have developed into service ecosystems:
‘systems of service systems’ (Vargo and Akaka 2012). Service ecosystems can
be found in many industries and areas of business activity. For example,
technology firms can help customers reduce operational costs, increase
performance, enhance decision-making and provide many other services using
a complex network of service providers. The main tech-service provider (or
anchor) establishes a long-term contract with the service user then provides
access to many smaller niche service providers, allowing the service user to
tap in to a package of tailored services (Banerjee et al. 2021).
In this section, we consider each of the areas of activity highlighted in
Table 11.2. The basic premise in each of the sectors is businesses engage in
economic activity, which involves using particular knowledge, skills and
expertise in the production of specialist services, as opposed to manufacturing
products (e.g. car production), growing produce (e.g. farming) or extracting
minerals (e.g. mining). We will explore this idea in more detail in the next
section when discussing the physical goods–service continuum model and the
rising importance of service-dominant logic.

Creative industries
Sometimes referred to as the new economy, creative industries and creative
clusters, defining this sector is not straightforward. However, creative
industries has become the most widely accepted name (Lazzeretti and Vecco
2018) and these areas of activity are enjoying a period of growth
across Europe. In the UK, around 3.1 million people work in this
sector. In terms of employment opportunities in the creative industries there
are national and regional differences, with London and the Southeast offering
the most jobs. Overall, there are over 2.3 million jobs across the sector in the
UK. The rise of creative industries has become an important area of research
and a significant economic driver. This sector relies on developing services
based on creative skills, for example creative (advertising), writers, fashion
designers, artists, musicians and TV producers. Software development and
electronic publishing are the most active parts of the sector – in economic
terms – followed by publishing, advertising, architecture, music and the visual
arts, film, TV and radio, and design. Creative industries generate distinctive
and authentic ‘products’, which are difficult to replicate and have international
appeal, for example video game publisher Electronic Arts’ FIFA 2022 (sport),
GRID Legends (motor sport) and Plants vs. Zombies (Neighborville) games.
Creative labour, then, ‘is geared to the production of original or distinctive
commodities that are primarily aesthetic and/or symbolic–expressive rather
than utilitarian and functional’ (Hirsch 1972). Nick Park (creator, animator anddirector, perhaps best known for Wallace and Gromit and Shaun the Sheep),
author J.K. Rowling (best known for the Harry Potter series of books, films
and spin-off products) and international singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran (known
for tracks such as ‘Shape of You’, and whose most popular songs have been
streamed billions of times) are all examples of successful individuals who
began and developed their careers in the creative industries. Increasingly,
creative people understand the importance of leveraging market advantage
from their skills and talents. In the past, commercial values and artistic
autonomy were seen as being in opposition, but now ‘the very best artists are
also some of the most effective entrepreneurs’ (Arts Council 2004).

Creative Industries: ‘Representing the Under￾represented’
The creative industries can respond to and inform public opinion, educate, and shape
sentiment in communities. The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity is one event
that does this, working with brands, advertisers and creative communications firms in more
than 90 countries. The event culminates in the presentation of awards, which are shaping
the focus and tone of output from the communications industry. The Cannes Lions aim to
connect the world of communications with consumers by reflecting challenges, changing
perspectives and highlighting opportunities.

Reflection of societypage 427
The Covid-19 pandemic affected the communications industry, with lockdowns, stay-at￾home orders, family and economic pressures, empathy for health workers, and mental
health and well-being issues. As a result, some of the big themes at the 2022 edition of the
festival focused on what the Lions called the Creative Comeback:
It Pays to Be Green – how brands handle sustainability issues
A Renewed Focus on Talent – changing attitudes in the industry around talent-spotting
Ready Player Two? – balancing big data, technology and creativity
Representing the Underrepresented – addressing diversity, equity and inclusion in
creative outputs.
Brands are in a period of change and are ‘transforming from the inside out to address social
inequalities in the world’. For the Cannes Lions this means encouraging business leaders to
attract under-represented talent and build more diverse teams. The aim is to highlight the
blind spots brands have and to encourage the creation of stories that reflect culture and
society. Themes include bringing diversity to the workforce, encouraging more diverse
supplier networks, and improving the visibility of marginalized voices and stories. Google’s
Project Understood is an example of a firm working with underrepresented groups to shape
its products and meet the needs of the wider community.
Based on: Holmes (2019); Cannes Lions (2022a, 2022b)
Government services
The public sector around the world involves the provision and delivery of
services by national and local governments for a country’s citizens. The sector
typically includes education, health and social care, police, defence and
transport. This is a highly complex part of the service industry, and processes
are central to much of the activity that takes place. For example, maintaining
relationships with suppliers is important to the ongoing success of procurement
processes. For example, Computacenter works closely with the UK central
government, providing IT solutions that not only meet exacting efficiency
standards but also add value through tailored long-term solutions and ongoing
support packages. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the firm helped the UK
Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) as its 80,000-strong workforce was
ordered to work from home, handling benefit claims, and managing welfare
and child maintenance issues. Computacentre rapidly supplied and configured
1,500 laptops per day, and upgraded office-based workstations to make the
DWP workplace Covid-compliant (Computacentre 2020).
EXHIBIT 11.1
Roles in the creative economy in actionSource: Rawpixel.com/Shutterstock
E-procurement has been widely adopted as a means of reducing
operational costs while maintaining organizational standards. However, while
it is arguably easy to measure the performance of the process of procurement
(especially since the advent of e-procurement systems), it is more difficult to
monitor the process of, say, a patient being taken into hospital, as the
individual circumstances can vary considerably – as can the outcome,
depending on the patient’s health at presentation at the hospital (or point of
care).
This sector also tends to have less clear goals, which makes setting
objectives complex. Another complexity, arguably unique to this sector, is the
involvement of politics. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) is often
subject to public scrutiny through the media (Collinson 2012).
Nevertheless, marketing has an important role to play, and organizations
from councils to hospitals can use the marketing mix in their strategy and
planning. For example, gov.uk is a digital service provided to help UK citizens
find helpful information and access services. It is important to note much of
the marketing activity in this sector is concerned with customer satisfaction,
despite the lack of direct competition.
Financial and business services
In this sector of the industry, banking and insurance are the key areas of
activity. The focus of the industry is financial management, which includes
investment, the lending of money, insurance issues and pensions. This industry
sector serves both large corporations and individuals. Investment banking
typically provides services to corporate clients. Earlier, we mentioned mergers,page 428
acquisitions and takeovers, and these activities are likely to be handled by
investment banks that provide the required skill sets to handle such moves.
Commercial banks handle deposits and loans for companies and individuals. In
the UK, the financial services sector employs more than one million people
and contributes around £164.8 million (8.6 per cent) to national economic
output. In Luxembourg, financial services contribute 25 per cent to economic
output, which puts it ahead of all other nations (Hutton and Shalchi 2021). The
City of London is a centre of excellence for financial expertise and has
attracted many leading financial organizations to locate part of their businesses
there. However, Brexit has led to a loss of jobs in the sector and the reform of
financial regulations. Nevertheless, this sector plays a significant part in the
economic well-being of local and global economies, and remains very
important to the UK.
Hospitality, travel and tourism
This part of the sector is very diverse. Under this heading we are primarily
thinking about the providers of travel and hospitality services rather than the
transportation element, which is covered separately. Hospitality is made up of
many facets, from pubs, restaurants and hotels to theme parks and special￾interest activities like wine-tasting events. The hospitality industry caters for
the needs of businesses and individuals alike. Exhibit 11.2 shows the economic
impact of the UK tourism industry.
EXHIBIT 11.2
Visit Britain estimates the potential for growth in the UK tourism industrySource: Visit Britain, www.visitbritain.org/visitor-economy-facts
From a marketing perspective, an important point to be aware of is many
of the services offered in this part of the sector are highly perishable. In other
words, the vacancy rate in a hotel is an important determinant of its likely
success. If the rate is high and there are many empty rooms, the business is
performing poorly. The same is true of the travel industry. Service suppliers
such as travel agents and operators, both online and offline, are constantly
aiming to fill their holidays and tours. Sales promotions are widely used to sell
available places. Travelling for pleasure has been on the increase for many
years. While travel used to be an activity associated with the affluent, package
holidays and, more recently, low-cost air travel have made foreign travel
accessible to more consumers. This sector also includes business travel.
Personal care
This sector encompasses a wide range of personal services: skin, hair and body
care, grooming, health treatments and many more niche services. The UK
Government recently officially recognized personal care as a specific area of
economic activity rather than being part of retailing or hospitality. This is a
significant and growing part of the service economy: the UK beauty industry
contributes more than £28 billion to GDP annually.
Property managementpage 429
As with other parts of the sectors, a range of activities are involved and,
although provided primarily for business-to-business markets, there is a part of
the sector that provides services for the individual. Property management
includes handling day-to-day management of clients, maintenance and repairs,
and this can mean handling residential or commercial properties. In the past,
this industry collected rent and maintained buildings, but today property
investors want engagement between individual customers, commercial
occupiers and the management team. Knight Frank is investing in technology
platforms that provide property management systems to facilitate such
engagement, concierge services and help desks. By automating part of the
facilities, managers are then able to spend more time on improving services to
property users. Read Marketing in Action 11.2 to find out more about how
French property agent Leggett Immobilier reinvented its services to become
the best estate agent in France.
Transport, storage and communications
This part of the sector covers rail, road, water and air transportation, and
communication services for both individuals and businesses. Communication
services include postal and telecommunication services. There are many
billions of service encounters in this sector and opportunities to engage
customers. Many firms are finding ways to improve their services, delight
customers and develop relationships with them. London
Underground transports more than a billion passengers each year; it
has recently invested billions of pounds in rail infrastructure, new trains and
upgrading existing carriages, and is committed to making life in the city better,
with a safe and reliable underground rail network (Transport for London
2018).
MARKETING IN ACTION 11.2
Leggett Immobilier Voted Best Estate Agency in
France
Property sales in France are buoyant and President Macron remains keen for this market to
continue to grow and attract both domestic and international buyers. In recent years,
approaching a million properties have been sold annually. Good rates for long-term loans,tax incentives and low interest rates for mortgages all help to support this vibrant and
valuable market. Research suggests international buyers of French properties, of whom 32
per cent are British, 15.5 per cent Belgian and 7.2 per cent Swiss, need help in finding the
right property and understanding how to buy property in France. Leggett Immobilier is an
estate agency that not only helps domestic and international buyers find the right property,
but has also developed a unique approach.
Source: Leggett Immobilier
Trevor Leggett moved to France and began a house renovation business, but soon realized
there was a market opportunity for a quality estate agent service for property buyers. At the
time, French agencies tended to focus on the domestic market, leaving international buyers
without good property services, and there was almost no online support. Trevor started
Leggett Immobilier at the end of the 1990s and the business has grown into France’s
leading international estate agency, which regularly wins awards for customer care and is
also one of the 10 fastest-growing property consultancies in Europe. The company has a
large support centre, with people on hand to answer questions (in many languages), and an
online portal, providing access to details of properties for sale, information and links to
agents who have specialist knowledge of local areas.
The Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit impacted on property buyers looking for main or second
homes in France. The July 2021 Brexit deadline for residency applications encouraged Brits
thinking of buying to move more quickly to secure a property in France. Covid-19 increased
demand for rural and more remote properties. So the Leggett team had to find ways to
enable viewing, even when severe travel restrictions were in place in France, the UK and
across Europe. The answer was online sales tours and 3D modelling.

Retailing
Retailing is an important element of the service industry; it is the activity
involved in the sale of products to the ultimate consumer. Retailing is a majorpage 430
employer and contributes to GDP. Again, this is a very diverse industry, and
retailers make use of every aspect of the product and services
marketing mix. To deliver the service expectations of their
customers, retailers have to ensure they have the right products in the right
place and at the right time, which has implications for purchasing and logistics
(discussed in detail in Chapter 16). One of the key functions of retailing is to
‘break-bulk so that consumers can buy goods in small quantities to satisfy their
needs’ (Ellis-Chadwick 2011).
Consumer decision-making involves not only the choice of product and
brand, but also of retail outlet. Most retailing is conducted in stores such as
supermarkets, catalogue shops and departmental stores, but non-store retailing
such as mail order and automatic vending also accounts for a large amount of
sales. Retailing provides an important service to customers, making products
available when and where customers want to buy them.
Many large retailers exert enormous power in the distribution chain
because of the vast quantities of goods they buy from manufacturers. The
purchasing power of retailers has meant manufacturers have to maintain high
service levels and good buyer–supplier relationships.
Non-profit organizations
Non-profit organizations contribute to service-sector activity, but are not
driven by the profit motive to satisfy their stakeholders. These types of
organizations focus their activities on social change and encouraging
communities to think and act in new ways. Firms with this focus are
sometimes referred to as engaging in social entrepreneurship (Kelly and Lewis
2009). This is not new thinking, as Ansoff argued in 1979 not-for-profit
organizations would need to become more socially relevant to survive. What is
new is the need for greater efficiency and effectiveness throughout the
organizations, so even though the profit motive is different, the need to provide
great service is not diluted. Read Marketing in Action 11.3 to find out how a
different approach to selling in the charity shop sector has revitalized business
for Save the Children.
This sector is also discussed in Chapter 5.page 431
MARKETING IN ACTION 11.3
Mary’s Living & Giving Shop
Since 2009, a new style of retailing has emerged in the third sector (non-governmental and
not-for-profit organizations). Charity shops have become more sophisticated and have
begun looking at how to create a brand image that is attractive to their customers. One such
example is Mary’s Living & Giving Shop for Save the Children. This is a charity shop that is
positioned in a premium and luxury goods market – rather unusual for a store concept that
relies on donations of clothing and accessories from members of the public and other
organizations to provide its products. The concept for the store was devised by Mary Portas
(retail consultant and broadcaster), who saw an opportunity to embed the charity shop more
positively in the local environment as well as improve returns for Save the Children.
Source: WENN Rights Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo
The connection with a larger charity was important, as there was a parenting advantage for
Mary’s fledgling concept: the larger charity provided structure, leadership, focus and
networks of volunteers and, in return, the Living & Giving stores provided enhanced value
for Save the Children. The store concept has led to 21 stores and even a pop-up store in
the world-renowned Liberty of London department store.
Save the Children is not the only charity to open niche stores. Oxfam has developed
specialized book and music stores, the British Red Cross, TRAID and Amnesty International
also operate niche stores, selling ‘upcycled’ clothes, wedding outfits and more.
Based on: Wood (2017); Charles et al. (2018); Liberty London (2018); McColl et al. (2018)The Nature of Services
In the previous section, we introduced different areas of activity in the services
industry. Next, we examine the nature of services, as these principles guide
much of the management activity in all of the above.
Services marketing emerged in the 1980s (Vargo and Lusch 2017). Cowell
(1995) states ‘what is significant about services is the relative dominance of
intangible attributes in the make-up of the “service product”’. Services are a
special kind of product and so require special understanding and particular
marketing efforts. Services often involve the use of something without ever
gaining ownership, for example renting an apartment, a car or a hotel room.
However, while pure services do not result in ownership, they may be linked to
a physical good. For example, a machine (physical good) may be sold with a
one-year maintenance contract (service).
Many offerings, however, contain a combination of the tangible and
intangible. For example, a marketing research study provides a report (physical
good) that represents the outcome of a number of service activities
(discussions with client, designing the research strategy, interviewing
respondents and analysing the results). In the creative industries, the service is
the generation of the ideas and concepts, which are then delivered in a tangible
form, for example an author writes a manuscript and the publisher then
produces a book or a production company a film.
This distinction between physical and service offerings can, therefore, best
be understood as a matter of degree rather than in absolute terms. Figure 11.1
shows a physical goods–service continuum, with the position of each offering
dependent upon its ratio of tangible/intangible elements. At the pure goods end
of the scale is clothing, as the purchase of a skirt or socks is not normally
accompanied by a service. Carpet purchases may involve an element of service
if they require professional laying. Machinery purchases may involve more
service elements in the form of installation and ongoing maintenance.
Software design is positioned on the service side of the continuum since the
value of the product is dependent on design expertise and services provided
rather than the cost of any physical product elements. Marketing research is
similarly services based, as discussed earlier. Finally, online banking
(management of digital assets) or psychotherapy (treatment of a mental health
issue) may be regarded as a pure service since the client receives nothing
tangible from the transaction.page 432
FIGURE 11.1
The physical goods–service continuum
Drawing a line between goods and services is difficult. Indeed, it has been
argued any such attempt to do so misses the point. Vargo and Lusch (2006)
suggested marketers’ ‘love affair’ with products is over and has been
superseded by a new ‘service-aligned ethos’: service-dominant logic (SDL),
which becomes more significant to marketing with the passage of time and the
expansion of service offerings. This means marketing managers should make
service central to their activities rather than the product, as service is a
fundamental basis of exchange and value is co-created by
multiple actors in the process (Vargo and Lusch 2017).
Ultimately, the SDL model suggests the product becomes a ‘keepsake’ of the
service experience and the customer is a ‘co-creator of value’. Vargo and
Lusch (2016) have been influential in the marketing literature, and while the
terminology has been hotly debated by academics (Brown and Patterson 2009;
O’Shaughnessy and O’Shaughnessy 2009), there is a growing body of work
supporting the notion that marketing theory and practice extends well beyond
the Four-Ps framework. Indeed, services have been defined in marketing
literature as ‘the application of specialized competences (knowledge and
skills) through deeds, processes, and performances for the benefit of another
entity or the entity itself’ (Vargo and Lusch 2004, 2017; Lusch and Vargo
2011).
Furthermore, services are everyday occurrences or acts (in a commercial
setting) that add value and provide assistance to a customer. This action entailsthe performance of activities, tasks and processes, which can be carried out
directly or indirectly. For example, ‘I have received excellent service from my
hairdresser’ (directly) or ‘I received excellent service through my bank
account’ (indirectly) (Lusch and Vargo 2011).
Ultimately, SDL sets out a model suggesting marketing can serve as a
framework for integrating marketing and supply chain management (SCM)
practices, to enable the ‘target user/consumer’ to take part in the creation
process (Lusch et al. 2010). According to Wirtz and Chew (2003) and Wirtz et
al. (2012), there are different categories of services that can be defined by
looking at service users and their possessions, and the extent to which the
services provided are tangible or intangible:
People processing: the services are directed at the individual, as in the case
of a manicurist, a barber and an optician. In this situation, the service user
visits the service provider in order to receive the services on offer.
Possession processing: the services are directed at physical possessions, for
example dry cleaners, a shoe repairer and a cleaner. Here, the service user is
less involved in the actual process, and to a certain extent the production of
the services (repairing the shoes) can be separated from the consumption of
the service (enjoyment of wearing the shoes with a newly replaced heel).
Mental stimulus processing: the services are aimed at the mind of the
individual, for example education. In this case, the service is information￾based.
Information processing: services are associated with an intangible asset, for
example accounting, banking and insurance. This is the most intangible type
of service production, whereby intangible assets are processed to produce
intangible outputs for the user, for example insurance cover for a car driver.
Until the point at which the driver needs the insurance cover, there is limited
physical evidence of its existence. Should the driver be involved in an
accident, then tangible features of the product might increase, for example a
courtesy car and medical healthcare. If the driver never needs to use his or
her insurance cover, then the only tangible evidence of its existence is the
payment for the service and a policy number.
The first two categories focus on tangible actions associated with people
and possessions, whereas the last two focus on intangible actions with people
and possessions – and each has different implications for the way in which the
service users and the service provider interact.We have already touched on one characteristic of services that
distinguishes them from physical goods – intangibility – and how this concept
might relate to service delivery. But there are other defining characteristics to
consider: inseparability, variability and perishability (see Figure 11.2).
FIGURE 11.2
Characteristics of services
Intangibility
Pure services cannot be seen, tasted, touched or smelled before they are bought
– that is, they are intangible. Rather, a service is a deed, performance or effort,
not an object, device or thing (Berry 1980). This may mean a customer finds
difficulty in evaluating a service before purchase. For example, it is virtually
impossible to judge how enjoyable a holiday will be before taking it because
the holiday cannot be shown to a customer before consumption.
For some services, their intangibility leads to difficulty in evaluation after
consumption. For example, it is not easy to judge how thorough a car service
has been immediately afterwards: there is no way of telling if everything that
should have been checked has been checked.page 433
The challenge for the service provider is to use tangible cues to service
quality. For example, a holiday firm may show pictures of the holiday
destination, display testimonials from satisfied holidaymakers and provide
details in a brochure of the kinds of entertainment available. A
garage may provide a checklist of items required to be carried out
in a service, and an indication of when these are completed and any further
repairs needed.
The task is to provide evidence of service quality. McDonald’s does this by
controlling the physical settings of its restaurants and by using its ‘golden
arches’ as a branding cue. By having a consistent offering it has effectively
dealt with the difficulties consumers have in evaluating the quality of a service.
Standard menus and ordering procedures have also ensured uniform and easy
access for customers, while allowing quality control.
Intangibility also means the customer cannot own a service. Payment is for
use or performance. For example, a car may be hired or a medical operation
performed. Service organizations sometimes stress the benefits of non￾ownership such as lower capital costs and the spreading of payment charges.
Inseparability
Unlike physical goods, services have inseparability, which means they have
simultaneous production and consumption. For example, a haircut, a holiday
and a rock concert are produced and consumed at the same time. This contrasts
with a physical good, which is produced, stored and distributed through
intermediaries before being bought and consumed. This illustrates the
importance of the service provider, which is an integral part of the satisfaction
gained by the consumer. How service providers conduct themselves may have
a crucial bearing on repeat business over and above the technical efficiency of
the service task. For example, how courteous and friendly the service provider
is may play a large part in the customer’s perception of the service experience.
The service must be provided, not only at the right time and in the right place,
but also in the right way (Berry 1980).
Often, in the customer’s eyes, a member of airline cabin crew is the
company. Consequently, the selection, training and rewarding of staff who are
the frontline service people are of fundamental importance in the achievement
of high standards of service quality. This notion of the inseparability of
production and consumption gave rise to the idea of relationship marketing in
services. In such circumstances, managing buyer–seller interaction is central topage 434
effective marketing and can be fulfilled only in a relationship with the
customer (Aijo 1996).
Furthermore, the consumption of the service may take place in the
presence of other consumers. This is apparent with restaurant meals, air, rail or
coach travel, and many forms of entertainment, for example. Consequently,
enjoyment of the service is dependent not only on the service provided, but
also on other consumers. Therefore, service providers need to identify possible
sources of nuisance (e.g. noise, smoke, queue-jumping) and make adequate
provision to avoid inter-customer conflict. For example, a restaurant layout
should provide reasonable space between tables so the potential for conflict is
minimized. During the Covid-19 pandemic, spacing between restaurant tables
increased to ensure greater safety during those uncertain times.
Marketing managers should not underestimate the role played by
customers in informing other customers.
Variability
Service quality may be subject to considerable variability, which makes
standardization difficult. Two restaurants within the same chain may have
variable service owing to the capabilities of their respective managers and
staff. Quality variations among physical products may be subject to tighter
controls through centralized production, automation and quality checking
before dispatch. Services, however, are often conducted at multiple locations,
by people who may vary in their attitudes (and tiredness), and are subject to
simultaneous production and consumption. The last characteristic means a
service fault (e.g. rudeness) cannot be quality checked and corrected between
production and consumption, unlike a physical product such as misaligned car
windscreen wipers.
The potential for variability in service quality emphasizes the need for
rigorous selection, training and rewarding of staff in service organizations.
Training should emphasize the standards expected of personnel when dealing
with customers. Evaluation systems should be developed that allow customers
to report on their experiences with staff.Service standardization is a related method of tackling the variability
problem. The use of reliable equipment rather than people can also help in
standardization, for example the supply of drinks via vending machines or cash
through bank machines. However, great care needs to be taken regarding
equipment reliability and efficiency. For example, bank ATMs have been
heavily criticized for being unreliable and running out of money at weekends.
Perishability
The fourth characteristic of services is their perishability in the sense that
consumption cannot be stored for the future. A hotel room or airline seat not
occupied today represents lost income that cannot be gained tomorrow. If a
physical good is not sold, it can be stored for sale later. Therefore, it is
important to match supply and demand for services. For example, if a hotel has
high weekday occupancy but is virtually empty at weekends, a key marketing
task is to provide incentives for weekend use. This might involve offering
weekend discounts, or linking hotel use with leisure activities such as golf,
fishing or hiking.
Service providers also have the problem of catering for peak demand when
supply may be insufficient. A physical goods provider may build up inventory
in slack periods for sale during times of peak demand. Service providers do not
have this option. Consequently, alternative methods need to be considered. For
example, supply flexibility can be varied through the use of part-time staff
during peak periods. Multi-skilling means employees may be trained in many
tasks. Supermarket staff can be trained to work in many different areas of the
business at peak periods to help manage demand. Participation by consumers
may be encouraged in production (e.g. self-service breakfasts in hotels, self￾check-in at airports) and in avoiding queues (e.g. self-service checkouts in
supermarkets). Demand may be smoothed through differential pricing to
encourage customers to visit during off-peak periods (e.g. lower-priced cinema
and theatre seats for afternoon performances). Stimulation of off-peak demand
can be achieved by special events (e.g. spa breaks or gourmet weekends for
hotels). If delay is unavoidable, then another option is to make it more
acceptable, for example by providing a comfortable waiting area with seating
and free refreshments. Finally, a reservation system, as commonly used in
restaurants, hair salons and theatres, can be used to control peak demand and
assist time substitution.page 435
While these characteristics of services have been widely criticized due to
the changing focus of services marketing in today’s world and the
advancement of digital technology, Moeller (2010) argues this framework
remains valid and provides a very useful lens through which to begin studying
services marketing and build a foundation of understanding. It is
then important to consider the extent to which service encounters
and servicescapes form a service ecosystem where co-creation by multiple
stakeholders can occur (Akaka and Vargo 2015).
Service ecosystems, discussed by Lusch and Vargo (2011) and Vargo and
Lusch (2016), are defined as ‘relatively self-contained, self-adjusting system(s)
of resource-integrating actors connected by shared institutional arrangement
and mutual value creation through service exchange’. This means value co￾creation can take place in a socially constructed setting amid a network of
actors and organizations. The reason for considering service ecosystems is they
extend beyond the characteristics of services, service encounters and
servicescapes, and draw attention to the setting (both past and present) in
which the service encounter occurs. This also allows for the consideration of
service from a more dynamic perspective (Akaka and Vargo 2015).
Managing Services
To manage services effectively, the service provider should understand the
whole of the customer journey, which involves five key aspects: managing
customer relationships, service quality, service productivity, service staff and
positioning services. Customer relationship management is an important topic;
it is covered in detail in Chapter 5. Read Mini Case 11.1 to consider how to
deliver five-star customer service experiences.
MINI CASE 11.1
Delivering Five-star Customer Service: Sandals Resorts
Internationalpage 436
Demand for luxury goods has grown in recent years, from watches, jewellery and designer
clothing to cars and superyachts. But what does customer service experience mean to the
luxury customer or high net-worth individuals (HNWIs), as they are sometimes referred to,
and how does the service provider meet their expectations? Academics debate the
definition of luxury but agree HNWIs are driven by hedonic motivations that are ultimately
satisfied in luxury settings. For marketing and brand managers, exclusivity, customer
motivations, product/service quality and price are key areas to understand and get right to
meet the needs of these customers.

The hospitality and tourism industry offers many opportunities for service providers to
devise highly targeted experiences for HNWIs, but this is an industry where competition is
intense and opportunities to create a differentiated offer hard to deliver. All-inclusive luxury
resorts (including food, accommodation and entertainment) abound, from eco-sensitive
private islands in Tahiti to wellness retreats in Arizona, and each vies to provide HNWIs with
the most exclusive, luxury tailored holiday experience.
Sandals Resorts International (SRI) has utilized customer knowledge as a strategy to create
differential advantage and stand out in this crowded marketplace. By focusing on the
creation of lasting memories and delivering a highly personalized experience, SRI’s success
has been built on providing very specialized services. The first Sandals resort was
established in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Largely due to its reputation built on excellent
personalized service, the business has grown and now employs more than 10,000 people,
operating 13 couples-only and six family-orientated resorts under the brand names Sandals
and Beaches. These all-inclusive resorts are located close to some of the best beaches in
the Caribbean. The business has been built around the idea of ‘giving customers more than
they expect or think they need’. Sandals is classified in the industry as ‘all￾inclusive resorts’, but it has successfully differentiated itself in this sector by
also offering ‘ultra all-inclusive’ options, which include special packages for weddings and
honeymoons, with features such as access to private offshore islands and themed gourmet
restaurants; some holiday packages even include personal butler services.
At the heart of SRI’s operations is a business intelligence system that gives its marketing
team the right tools to carry out the analysis needed to ensure customers are completely
satisfied, and also to ensure the business operates profitably. The system gathers data on a
daily basis, and close attention is paid to key performance indicators such as occupancyrates, staffing levels, food costs and spend per room. Daily management updates enable
the team to monitor performance and take immediate action if any issues are detected.
In addition to the emphasis on exceeding guests’ expectations, SRI invests substantially in
its employees, who it refers to as ‘team members’, through the Sandals Corporate
University (SCU). Each team member is specially selected and trained to carry out their
role, and continually encouraged to develop personally. The SCU ensures team members
understand they are as important as their guests, which is fundamental to a successful
service organization, because happy team members give excellent service, resulting in
happy, loyal guests. The Stewart International School of Hospitality & Tourism at the
University of the West Indies aims to develop industry-leading graduates and research to
expand SRI’s investment in education, in memory of its founder Butch Stewart.
SRI does not stop with its customers; it also has a commitment to society. The Sandals
Foundation makes investments to support the development of local communities. There are
three core elements to the foundation: the community, education and the environment. By
working with the community, the foundation tackles social issues relating to violence,
poverty, unemployment and healthcare, and community programmes have succeeded in
‘giving people a chance to change their lives’. Education initiatives have provided
scholarships and learning for thousands of students in the Caribbean of all ages and across
all aspects of life. For example, in Montego Bay, parenting workshops raise awareness of
the importance of education and lifelong learning. Preserving the environment is very
important, and the foundation is increasingly taking a leadership role in environmental
programmes in both the public and private sectors. At the Boscobel Marine Sanctuary,
ecologists are working to protect coral and fish stocks, and also engage local community
fishermen to raise awareness of behaviour that is damaging the fragile underwater
environment.
Over 40 years, SRI has been consistently rewarded for its emphasis on people. It receives
high satisfaction levels from guests, and more than half return; SRI’s employees are happy
and remain loyal, and SRI holds numerous awards from the hospitality sector. Furthermore,
Gordon ‘Butch’ Stewart, the founder of the Sandals vision, demonstrated how a successful
hospitality brand can foster wide economic and social development that has made a
significant contribution to helping communities in the Caribbean have a more sustainable
way of living.
However, in 2022, at SRI’s Emerald Bay resort in the Bahamas, a tragic incident involving
three US visitors caused major concerns, and threatened to tarnish both the resort’s and the
brand’s reputations. Reportedly, carbon monoxide poisoning caused the death of the three
visitors and another to fall ill. The Bahamian authorities identified it as a standalone event,
but SRI was quick to respond, issuing a statement saying ‘Ensuring the safety and well￾being of our guests and team members is and will always be paramount.’ Carbon monoxide
detectors have been installed throughout Emerald Bay and there are further plans to
introduce these in all SRI resorts. Safety experts have been brought in to review all systems
and risks at the resort.
Responding quickly, demonstrating capacity to manage critical incidents, and handling any
ensuing public and press investigation is key to maintaining brand reputation.
Questions:
1. Customer retention is at the centre of relationship management. Suggest why SRI
has been successful in encouraging more than half of its customers to return.page 437
2. Imagine you are the customer service manager at Sandals’ Emerald Bay resort in the
Bahamas and are responsible for managing the serious incident reported in this
case. Suggest how you are going to manage this situation and how you will reassure
customers staying at the resort at the time of the critical event.
3. Discuss the drivers and motivations of HNWIs and how these relate to SRI.

Managing service quality
Intuitively, it makes sense to suggest improving service quality will increase
customer satisfaction, leading to higher sales and profits. Studies have
repeatedly shown high levels of service quality from frontline employees and
throughout the business affect customer satisfaction, loyalty and profitability
(Maklan et al. 2017).
Service quality is multi-dimensional concept and SERVQUAL was
originally proposed by Parasuraman and colleagues (1985, 1988) as a scale
used to measure and classify performance, by looking at the reliability,
assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness of the service provider.
These authors developed a checklist for service providers to monitor
performance when evaluating the outcome and experience of a service
encounter:
1. Access: is the service provided at convenient locations and times, with little
waiting?
2. Reliability: is the service consistent and dependable?
3. Credibility: can customers trust the service and its staff?
4. Security: can the service be used without risk?
5. Understanding the customer: does it appear the service provider
understands customer expectations?
6. Responsiveness: how quickly do service staff respond to customer problems,
requests and questions?
7. Courtesy: do service staff act in a friendly and polite manner?8. Competence: do service staff have the required skills and knowledge?
9. Communication: is the service described clearly and accurately?
0. Tangibles: how well managed is the tangible evidence of the service (e.g.
staff appearance, décor, layout)?
SERVQUAL was developed in an offline context, but marketers also need
to consider the service context online, where measures and classifications of
service are slightly different. eTailQ (Wolfinbarger and Gill 2003) proposed
fulfilment and reliability, website design, privacy and security, and customer
service as dimensions to consider when evaluating service quality for shopping
online.
The service quality landscape has today evolved further, with robots and AI
agents increasingly deployed as frontline ‘employees’, meaning further
refinements are needed to evaluate service quality performance. Read Hidden
Gem 11.1 to find out more about measuring the service quality of AI chatbots.
HIDDEN GEM 11.1
The Bot Platform
The Bot Platform works with firms around the world, designing AI and bots to achieve
various aims: saving the time of human employees, increasing accuracy of service
provision, improving management operations. At LeadingAgile, bots are deployed to
automate staff onboarding and to alert staff to new training opportunities. Since automating
these tasks many hours have been saved and new staff feel better connected to this virtual
organization. Honest Burgers – a small London restaurant, which now has 40 locations –
had the problem of how to connect its 1,000 employees. The Bot Platform developed a suite
of tools to enable staff connections and collaboration, and help individuals and teams to
operate more effectively. Honest College is a personalized learning programme, which is
seamlessly integrated into the workplace and has enabled the upskilling of 150 waiting staff
to become chefs. Using bots helps this restaurant chain to communicate and operate
effectively, reducing costs and upskilling staff.

Chatbots are challenged to understand human questions, respond accurately, understand
emotions and provide human-like responses. Chen and colleagues (2022) propose AI
chatbot service quality (AICSQ) (see next image), which includes:
Semantic understanding, whereby AI chatbots solve customer requirements given in
voice and text formats.
Close human–AI collaboration: AI chatbots offer superior ability at calculations, whereas
humans are good at solving personal human problems, so the aim is to provide an
integrated level of service. Depending on the complexity of the service, there is scope to
develop close human–AI collaboration.
Human-like: we expect customer service to be delivered by humans and
this makes many people feel happier. So chatbots are expected to possess
human-like characteristics if they are to enhance firm–customer interactions.
Continuous improvement comes from regular interactions with AI through self-learning.
To succeed, AI chatbots should show continual improvements in understanding and
problem-solving skills.
Personalization: using big data enables the identification of a customer’s unique
characteristics and profile. The accuracy of the personal approach is a measure of the
service quality.
Culture adaptation: there is a need to offer services in multiple languages so chatbots
need language skills and to respect different cultural norms (e.g. standardized or
personal service).
Efficiency means high-quality automated and responsive services.

At the opposite end of the service quality spectrum is poor service. There
are four causes of poor perceived quality (see Figure 11.3). These barriersseparate the perception of service quality from what customers expect
(Parasuraman et al. 1985).
1. Misconception barrier: this arises from management’s misunderstanding
of what the customer expects. Lack of marketing research may lead
managers to misconceive the important service attributes customers use
when evaluating a service, and the way in which customers use attributes in
evaluation. For example, a restaurant manager may believe shortening the
gap between courses may improve customer satisfaction, when the customer
actually values a pause between eating.
2. Inadequate resources barrier: managers may understand customer
expectations but are unwilling to provide the resources necessary to meet
them. This may arise because of a cost reduction or productivity focus, or
simply because of the inconvenience it may cause.
3. Inadequate delivery barrier: managers may understand customer
expectations and supply adequate resources, but fail to select, train and
reward staff adequately, resulting in poor or inconsistent service. This may
manifest itself in poor communication skills, being inappropriately dressed
or displaying unwillingness to solve customer problems.
4. Exaggerated promises barrier: even when customer understanding,
resources and staff management are in place, a gap between customer
expectations and perceptions can still arise through exaggerated promises.
Advertising and selling messages that build expectations to a pitch that
cannot be fulfilled may leave customers disappointed even when receiving
good service. For example, a tourist brochure claiming a hotel is ‘just a few
minutes from the sea’ may lead to disappointment if the walk takes 10
minutes.
FIGURE 11.3
Barriers to the matching of expected and perceived service levelspage 439
Meeting customer expectations
A key to providing service quality is the understanding and meeting of
customer expectations. To do so requires a clear picture of the criteria used to
form these expectations, recognizing consumers of services value not only the
outcome of the service encounter but also the experience of taking part in it.
For example, an evaluation of a haircut depends not only on the quality of the
cut but also on the experience of having a haircut. Clearly, a hairdresser needs
not only technical skills but also the ability to communicate in an interesting
and polite manner. Meeting and exceeding customers’ expectations is even
more important as good and bad experiences can easily be shared via social
media such as Twitter and Instagram.
Where service quality is dependent on a succession of service encounters
(e.g. a hotel stay may encompass check-in, the room itself, the restaurant,
breakfast and checkout), each should be measured in terms of its impact on
total satisfaction so corrective actions can be taken (Danaher and Mattson
1994). Customer service questionnaires are widely used in the service industry
to gather feedback on customer experiences. Social media platforms are also
widely used in the same context.When firms fail to meet customer expectations, the experience negatively
affects the service provider and the customer. A high percentage of customers
are reported to be receiving unsatisfactory service encounters; when these
occur, they experience disappointment, rage, frustration, anger, and lost time
and money. Furthermore, less than one in four customers are satisfied by an
apology, with most looking for financial compensation for service failure
(Morgan 2019). The customer’s demographic attributes have been found to
inform service recovery expectations, and should be considered when a firm
looks to close the gap between service expectations, experience and failure
(Bozkurt and Gligor 2021).
Managing service productivity
Productivity is a measure of the relationship between an input and an output.
For example, if more people can be served (output) using the same number of
staff (input), productivity per employee has risen. Clearly, there can be conflict
between improving service productivity (efficiency) and raising service quality
(effectiveness). For example, a beauty therapist who reduces time spent with a
client may increase the number of clients per day, but the reduction in time
spent on service delivery is likely to affect the quality of service and therefore
customer retention.
Clearly, a balance must be struck between productivity and service quality.
At some point, quality gains become so expensive they are not worthwhile.
There are ways of improving productivity without compromising quality,
although for any such implementation to be successful customers need to
understand why services are being replaced with new methods of service
delivery and how they will benefit, and it should be recognized that customers
will have differing abilities (e.g. high and low technology expertise) (Reinders
et al. 2015). Technology applications, obtaining customer involvement in
production of the service, and balancing supply and demand are three methods
of achieving this.
Technology applications
Technology applications can be used to improve productivity and service
quality. For example, airport X-ray surveillance equipment raises the
throughput of passengers (productivity) and speeds the process of checking in
(service quality). Automatic cash dispensers in banks increase the number ofpage 440
transactions per period (productivity), while reducing customer waiting time
(service quality). Automatic vending machines increase the number of drinks
sold per establishment (productivity), while improving accessibility for
customers (service quality).
Retailers have benefited from barcodes and electronic funds transfer at
point of sale (EFTPOS). Timely and detailed sales information can aid buying
decisions and provide retail buyers with a negotiating advantage over
suppliers. Other benefits from this technology include improved labour
scheduling, stock management and distribution systems. Read Marketing in
Action 11.4 to discover how the humble hashtag has been transformed into a
marketing tool.
MARKETING IN ACTION 11.4
How Social Media Transformed the Hashtag Into a
Marketing Tool
Social media have provided popular platforms on which to engage with customers, and the
hashtag has enabled messages to be found and shared. Coca-Cola’s #ShareaCoke
originally involved bottles of Coke with names on, and the campaign drove sales and
created extensive social media coverage. The approach was so successful ‘Share-a-Coke’
has become a regular summer campaign in North America and across the globe. LEGO
celebrated its 90th anniversary on 10 August 2022, reinvigorating its four-year-long
campaign #RebuildTheWorld, designed to inspire and engage its fans in enjoying play, and
promoting the well-being and happiness of the whole family. Its global campaign on Twitter
was highly successful, using videos to tease, engage and reinforce the brand, with
#RebuildTheWorld shared more than 100,000 times within the first four days of the
campaign’s launch.Source: Lego Group
The hashtag (#) had previously been just a simple symbol used in the IT industry to
highlight a special meaning for software engineers, but now it has been transformed into a
powerful marketing tool. Twitter started using hashtags in 2007, and a bushfire in the same
year proved the usefulness of the hashtag, as messages tagged #sandiegofire were shared
across California. Twitter then began linking anything preceded by # so its users could
share their experiences and find other tweets with similar things to say. Instagram and Flickr
followed suit, and then leading brands began making use of the hashtag in their marketing
campaigns.
Marketers realized tweets containing hashtags were more likely to be shared and
retweeted, and could be used to build different types of powerful communications
campaigns, such as the Motor Neurone Disease charity’s #IceBucketChallenge. The
challenge encouraged people to throw a bucket of icy water over their heads, and exceeded
expectations by raising in excess of $100 million. British Airways wanted to remind its
customers about the ‘magic of flying’ and so used #lookup as part of a campaign. This used
interactive digital advertising boards that tracked aircraft using sophisticated surveillance
technology and interrupted other advertisers’ displays with a child pointing to the sky every
time a plane flew overhead.
The beer industry in the UK wanted to change behaviour and to urge consumers to drink
differently (cutting down on alcohol consumption) during the month of January, rather than
completely abstain from visiting bars and pubs. This campaign was #DryJanuary.
The hashtag symbol is widely used by marketers to build interest in a brand and to create
successful campaign-specific hashtags to generate genuine user content. Hashtags can
also be used to follow trends and create campaigns to manage customer expectations and
to address social issues. The #MeToo movement opposing sexual violence against women
initially raised awareness of the treatment of women in the Hollywood film industry butpage 441
became so powerful it attracted attention globally. Within 24 hours of the first tweet, more
than 4.7 million people and 12 million posts had appeared online.

Customer involvement in production
The inseparability between production and consumption provides an
opportunity to raise both productivity and service quality. For example, self￾service breakfast bars and petrol stations improve productivity per
employee and reduce customer waiting time (service quality). The
effectiveness of this tactic relies heavily on customer expectations, and on
managing transition periods. It should be used when there is a clear advantage
to customers in their involvement in production. In other instances, reducing
customer service may reduce satisfaction. For example, a hotel that expected
its customers to service their own rooms would need a persuasive
communications programme to convince customers this lack of service was
reflected in cheaper rates.
Balancing supply and demand
Because services cannot be stored, balancing supply and demand is a key
determinant of productivity. Entertainment venues, hotels or aircraft that are
less than half full incur low productivity. If, in the next period, the service
provider is faced with excess demand, the unused space in the previous period
cannot be used to meet it. The combined result is low productivity and
customer dissatisfaction (low service quality). By smoothing demand or
increasing the flexibility of supply, both productivity and service quality can
be achieved.
Smoothing demand can be achieved through differential pricing and
stimulating off-peak demand (e.g. weekend breaks). The flexibility of supply
may be improved by using part-time employees, multi-skilling and
encouraging customers to serve themselves.
The Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath created major challenges across
the service industry but particularly for airlines. The airline industry’s trade
was down around 60 per cent in 2020 compared to the previous year, as many
planes were grounded when international borders were closed. Even when
restrictions were eased, hygiene and safety measures restricted traveller
numbers. Post-pandemic, airlines have accrued very high debt levels due toborrowing to stay in business during the pandemic. The impact on travellers is
increased ticket prices. Airlines and airports, and their employees, are also
facing challenges due to staff shortages, limited wage increases and rapid
growth in demand due to holidaymakers and business travellers returning to air
travel. Air freight, however, was one area of the aviation industry that thrived
during Covid-19. This has spelled chaos for the travel industry post-pandemic.
Airlines, unable to service demand as they are short of pilots, are cancelling
many flights, leaving travellers without transport, while baggage is piling up
due to lack of staff (Bouwer et al. 2022). Low-cost airline easyJet, which
operates many of its flights from London Luton and Gatwick airports to
popular tourist destinations across Europe, also reported chaos at hub airports
in Europe as a reason for many flight cancellations, but has also been taking
rows of seats out of some of its aircrafts to reduce the crew numbers needed to
operate flights. Disruption has knock-on effects, leading to delays and
eventually cancellations. It may be some time before the airline industry is
able to re-establish a balance between supply and demand (Topham 2022).
Managing service staff
Many services involve a high degree of contact between service staff and
customers. This is true for such service industries as healthcare, banking,
catering and education. The quality of the service experience is therefore
heavily dependent on staff–customer interpersonal relationships. John Carlzon,
the head of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), called these meetings
moments of truth. He explained SAS faced 65,000 moments of truth per day,
and the outcomes determined the success of the company.
Service failures (e.g. delay, incorrect order processing) happen, but it is
how service recovery is deployed that has the greatest impact. Levels of
customer satisfaction can fall, relationships can be broken and customers stop
patronizing a service business because service recovery failed rather than due
to a customer’s dissatisfaction with the quality of what they had bought (Kim
and Jang 2021). Frontline staff are important sources of customer information
and, if properly trained and motivated, can provide crucial inputs for service
recovery.
For service employees to treat customers well, they need to feel engaged in
the process. In firms where staff have a high regard for the human resources
policy, customers also have a positive opinion of the service they receive. For
example, retailer Marks & Spencer introduced an online training programmepage 442
to help employees in supporting customers with disabilities. The programme
was developed with the Royal National Institute of Blind People and a
customer, after he was not allowed support from his service dog when visiting
a London store (Calnan 2020).
To select the right people for the job is the starting point of the process.
The nature of the job needs to be defined and the appropriate personality
characteristics needed to perform it effectively outlined. Once selected,
training is required to familiarize recruits with the job requirements and the
culture of the organization. Socialization allows a new recruit to experience the
culture and tasks of the organization. Usually, the aim is creative
individualism, whereby the recruit accepts all of the key behavioural norms but
is encouraged to display initiative and innovation in dealing with problems.
Thus, standards of behaviour are internalized, but the creative abilities of the
individual are not subjugated to the need to conform.
Service quality may also be affected by the degree to which staff are
empowered, or given the authority to satisfy customers and deal with their
problems. Google is a business that empowers its staff to be creative. Google
cafés are an initiative designed to encourage interaction and innovation among
employees. However, empowerment programmes need to recognize the
increased responsibility thrust on employees. Not everyone will welcome this,
and reward systems (e.g. higher pay or status) need to be thought through. At
the luxury hotel chain Ritz-Carlton, customer service is of paramount
importance and, as a result, frontline staff are given the right be involved with
the work they are doing and to make decisions on how to best serve hotel
guests. The company empowers its employees through training and trusting in
them to make accurate decisions that will wow their customers (Solomon
2014).
Maintaining a motivated workforce in the face of irate customers, faulty
support systems and the boredom that accompanies some service jobs is a
demanding task. Motivational factors include recognition of achievement, role
clarity, opportunities for advancement, the interest value of the job, monetary
rewards and setting challenging but achievable targets. A key factor in
avoiding demotivation is to monitor support systems so staff work with
efficient equipment and facilities to help them carry out their jobs.page 443
Service evaluation is also important in managing staff. Customer feedback
is essential to maintaining high standards of service quality. McDonald’s
continually monitors quality, service, cleanliness and value, and if a franchisee
fails to meet these standards it is dropped. The results of customer research
should be fed back to employees so they can relate their performance standards
to customer satisfaction. Enlightened firms tie financial incentives to the
results of such surveys.
Positioning services
Positioning is the process of establishing and keeping a distinctive place in the
market for a firm and its products. Most successful service companies
differentiate themselves from the competition on attributes their target
customers value highly. They develop service concepts that are highly valued
and communicate to target customers so they accurately perceive the position
of the service.
The positioning task entails two decisions:
1. choice of target market (where to compete)
2. creation of a differential advantage (how to compete).
These decisions are common to both physical products and services.
Creating a differential advantage is based on understanding target customers’
requirements better than the competition. Figure 11.4 shows the relationship
between target customer needs and the differential advantage that can be
developed using the services marketing mix. On the left of the
figure is an array of factors (choice criteria) customers may use to
judge a service. How well a service firm satisfies those criteria depends on its
marketing mix (shown on the right of the figure). Marketing research can be
useful in identifying important choice criteria, but care needs to be taken in
such studies. Asking customers which are the most important factors when
buying a service may give misleading results. For example, the most important
factor when travelling by air may be safety. However, this does not mean
customers use safety as a choice criterion when deciding which airline to use.
If all major airlines are perceived as being similar in terms of safety, other less
important factors, like the quality of in-flight meals and service, may be the
crucial attributes used in decision-making.FIGURE 11.4
Positioning for services
Target marketing
The basis of target marketing is market segmentation. A market is analysed to
identify groups of potential customers with similar needs and price
sensitivities. The potential of each of these segments is assessed on such
factors as size, growth rate, degree of competition, price sensitivity, and the fit
between its requirements and the firm’s capabilities (see Chapter 7 for further
discussion).
The most attractive markets are not always the largest (as discussed in
Mini Case 11.1 on Sandals Resorts International), as saturated markets often
confer high levels of competition. So, a service organization should apply
segmentation and target marketing analysis to determine a suitable marketing
mix for the specific groups of customers, thereby creating an opportunity to
differentiate its offer. For example, Southwest Airlines used the following
strapline to differentiate itself in the crowded airline industry: ‘We like to think
of ourselves as a Customer Service company that happens to fly airplanes’
(Southwest Airlines 2015). During the Covid-19 pandemic, the airline wanted
to reassure customers of its promise to protect their safety when flying (see
Exhibit 11.3).

Marketing managers also need to consider those potential customers who
are not directly targeted, but may find the service mix attractive. The halo
effect refers to connections to a brand (strong or weak), which can influence
an individual’s attitude when evaluating products and service. There are many
things that can shape their attitude, for example in the tourism industry an
image in a glossy magazine of a city break or a distant beach location can
create a general impression in the mind of the reader and, if this is a positive
impression, it can then create the halo effect and influence biased valuation in
the future relating to this destination. Those customers at the periphery of the
target market are called halo customers and can make a substantial difference
between success and failure (see Figure 11.5), although marketers should
beware negative reviews and the horn effect. Research into the halo effect
using Booking.com, hotels in 400 top destinations and Tripadvisor reviews
found evidence of the halo effect having a positive effect on
hotels and a spilling over to the location. However, online
reviews can also be negative and in this study the influence was found to be
stronger as ‘dissatisfied people tend to react more aggressively and penalize
the ratings of a hotel more harshly’. Thus is the halo effect turned into a
‘crown of thorns’, or the horn effect (Nicolau et al. 2020).
FIGURE 11.5

Launching into a new target market may require trials to test the innovation
and refine the concept. For example, when KFC was considering moving into
the breakfast segment of the fast-food market it ran trials in selected outlets
before full launch (Charles 2008). Sometimes the changing marketing
environment can also expand the reach of a service. In the case of KFC, it has
realized changing consumer tastes and more emphasis on healthy living means
a change of menu. By 2020, the fast-food firm had introduced menu options
under 600 calories (e.g. Fillet Burger Meal, Fillet Ricebox and Drink) (KFC
2022).
Differential advantage
Understanding customer needs will be the basis of the design of a new service
concept if it is to be differentiated from the competition. Factors that are highly
valued by target customers play an important role and generally require
creative use of marketing-mix elements to deliver required benefits, for
example greater accessibility, more reliable or faster delivery, greater
convenience, more comfort, higher-quality work, higher prestige, or other
target segment needs, as shown on the left-hand side of Figure 11.4.
Mini Case 11.1 examined luxury customer service encounters and how
Sandals Resorts International has differentiated itself through the use of
service excellence. For marketers, it is important to achieve a balance between
what is valued by the customer as important and how the customer perceivesthe service provider’s performance. For travel services this can be challenging
as they are exposed to a great deal of variability, changing customer needs and
environmental pressures, so finding ways for their customer service teams to
work together efficiently and effectively helps to achieve performance goals
and identify ways to stand out from the competition. Peng and colleagues
(2022) suggest building adaptive and informed service teams by creating a
learning environment and rewarding knowledge application can improve
service firms’ operating performance.
On a practical level, for both the service provider and its customers, there
is no point in going too far to provide quality service. FedEx, the international
shipping firm, has guidelines on how to avoid customer overkill. It suggests
avoiding too much contact (hotel guests constantly contacted by front desk),
asking too many questions, providing excessive perks (e.g. lavish baskets of
fruit in a hotel room and private boxes at sporting events). Furthermore, it
suggests listening to what the customer wants and making appropriate
decisions about when to say no is the key to providing a balanced and highly
regarded service (FedEx 2015).
The services marketing mix
The services marketing mix is an extension of the Four-Ps framework
introduced in Chapter 1. The essential elements of product, promotion, price
and place remain, but three additional variables – people, physical evidence
and process – are included to produce a Seven-Ps mix (Booms and Bitner
1981). The need for the extension emerged due to the high degree of direct
contact between the firm and the customer, the highly visible nature of the
service assembly processes, and the simultaneity of production and
consumption. While it is possible to discuss people, physical evidence and
process within the original Four-Ps framework (e.g. people could be
considered part of the product offering), the extension allows a more thorough
analysis of the marketing ingredients necessary for successful services
marketing. Each element of the marketing mix will now be examined from a
service perspective.
Product Physical products can be inspected and tried before purchase, but
pure services are intangible; you cannot go to a showroom to see a marketing
research report or medical operation you are considering. This means service
customers suffer higher perceived risk in their decision-making, and the three
elements of the extended marketing mix – people, physical evidence andpage 445
process – are crucial in influencing the customer’s perception of service
quality.
The brand name of a service can also influence perceptions of it. Four
characteristics of successful brand names are as follows (Berry et al. 1980):
1. Distinctiveness: it immediately identifies the services provider and
differentiates it from the competition.
2. Relevance: it communicates the nature of the service and the service benefit.
3. Memorability: it is easily understood and remembered.
4. Flexibility: it not only expresses the service organization’s current business
but is also broad enough to cover foreseeable new ventures.
Examples of effective brand names are: Visa (financial services), which
suggests internationality; Travelodge (hospitality), which implies travel
accommodation; and Virgin Atlantic (air travel), which associates the airline
with flights to and from North America.
Service providers are constantly seeking ways to differentiate themselves
from their competitors. For example, Premier Inns and IHG Hotels invested
heavily in new super-comfortable beds by Hypnos and bedding to gain an
advantage over their competitors by offering ‘pressure mapping technology’
for a great night’s sleep, while the luxury five-star Dorchester Hotel goes a
step further with handmade Vispring Elite hypoallergenic mattresses (Cooke
2021).
The quality of the physical product is also used as a differentiator by
airlines, for example stainless steel rather than plastic cutlery, more leg room,
personal TV screens showing up-to-date movies and, for first-class long-haul
passengers, more comfortable beds. Service companies need to reassess their
product offerings to keep up with changing consumer tastes, social trends and
technology innovations. For example, Disney redesigned its guest experiences
during the pandemic to prevent large crowds forming when queuing at its
theme parks, by expanding its smartphone app to enable mobile food ordering,
restaurant booking and virtual queuing for rides, where guests book a specific
time for their chosen attraction and the resort can manage demand more
effectively to improve visitors’ overall experience (Hartzer 2020).Promotion The intangible element of a service may be difficult to
communicate. For example, it may be difficult to represent courtesy, hard work
and customer care in an advertisement. Once again, the answer is to use
tangible cues to help customers understand and judge the service. A hotel can
show its buildings, swimming pool, friendly staff and happy customers. An
investment firm can provide tangible evidence of past performance.
Testimonials from satisfied customers are increasingly used to communicate
services benefits, and to act as recommendations to existing and potential
customers. Customer experiences have become increasingly important,
especially as customer journeys can reach multiple touchpoints before making
a purchase decision (Lemon and Verhoef 2016). Online feedback and reviews
are a key source of information, as five-star feedback and excellent reviews
can be a key driver of customer engagement and purchasing. Many tech firms
have developed sophisticated approaches combining free product offers with
reviews to promote product awareness and sales. Google Drive, Dropbox (data
storage) and Wix.com (website builder), for example, draw in customers with
feature-limited versions of their core products. Firms should aim to achieve a
balance that does not cannibalize sales of the core product but is sufficient to
generate positive reviews (Cao et al. 2022).
Advertising communicates and reinforces the image of a service. For
example, store image can enhance customer satisfaction and build store
loyalty (Bloemer and de Ruyter 1998). Advertising can also be used to
create awareness of the benefits consumers can expect from the service
provider; images of helpful staff are widely used in the advertising of
services (see Exhibit 11.4).
Digital marketing is widely used to encourage engagement with service
brands; in all the major service industries (following the pandemic) the
trends are towards growth in online ad spend, especially in the UK (e.g.
travel by 33 per cent, retail by 14.1 per cent, financial services by 9.5 per
cent). By 2024, digital ad spending is predicted to account for 79 per cent of
total media spending (Fisher 2021).
Personal selling can also be effective in services marketing because of the
high perceived risk inherent in many service purchases. For example, a
salesperson can explain the details of a personal pension plan or investment
opportunity, answer questions and provide reassurance. The high perceived
risk inherent in buying services means salespeople need to be trained to ask
for referrals; customers should be asked if they know of other people or
organizations that might benefit from the service. The customer can then bepage 446
used as an entrée and point of reference when approaching and selling to the
new prospect.
Word of mouth (on- and offline) is critical to success for services because of
their experiential nature. For example, talking to people who have visited a
resort or hotel is more convincing than reading holiday brochures. Social
media are playing an increasingly important part in this form of
communication, for example the Four Seasons hotel group used
Facebook and Twitter to share both guest and staff messages about what its
hotels had on offer, things to do at particular destinations, and local tips and
deals.

Communication should also be targeted at employees because of their
importance in creating and maintaining service quality. Internal
communications can define management expectations of staff, reinforce the
need to delight the customer and explain the rewards that follow from giving
excellent service. External communications depicting service quality can also
influence internal staff if they include employees and show how they take
exceptional care of their customers. Businesses should be careful not to
exaggerate promises in promotional material since this may build up
unachievable expectations. For example, UK company Evergreen’s advertising
claimed its artificial grass to be eco-friendly and capable of cultivating a
cleaner environment, but the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the
UK received complaints about the ads being misleading and, while the firm
defended its claims, the ASA ruled environmental claims must be clear andthat unqualified claims (like Evergreen’s) could lead to misunderstanding
(ASA 2022).
Price Price is a key marketing tool for services as, because it is often
difficult to evaluate a service before purchase, price may act as an indicator of
perceived quality. For example, in a travel brochure the price charged by hotels
may be used to indicate their quality. Some companies expect a management
consultant to charge high fees, otherwise they cannot be particularly good.
Price is an important tool in controlling demand: matching demand and supply
is critical in services because they cannot be stored. Creative use of pricing can
help to smooth demand. Another key segmentation variable with services is
price sensitivity – some customers may be willing to pay a much higher price
than others.
Time is often used to segment price-sensitive and price-insensitive
customers. For example, the price of international air travel is often dependent
on length of stay. Travellers from Europe to the US will pay a lot less if they
stay a minimum of six nights (including Saturday). Airlines know customers
who stay for shorter periods are likely to be business people who are willing
and able to pay a higher price. Budget hotel chain Travelodge adopted a
dynamic demand-led online pricing system similar to that pioneered by easyJet
and Ryanair. Rooms are often priced cheaply to begin with, but the price rises
as the hotel becomes fully booked (Travelodge 2022).
Some services – for example, accounting and management consultancy –
charge their customers fees. A strategy needs to be thought out concerning
fees. How far can fees be flexible to secure or retain particular customers?
How will the fee level compare to that of the competition? Will there be an
incentive built in to the fee structure for continuity, forward commitment or the
use of the full range of services on offer? Five pricing techniques may be used
when setting fee levels:
1. Offset: low fee for core service but recouping with add-ons.
2. Inducement: low fee to attract new customers or to help retain existing
customers.
3. Diversionary: low basic fees on selected services to develop the image of
value for money across the whole range of services.
4. Guarantee: full fee payable on achievement of agreed results.
5. Predatory: competition’s fees undercut to remove them from the market;
high fees charged later.page 447
Digital channels make price transparency a reality and in this way have
empowered customers with more purchasing information on competing brands
and offers, and have enabled price tracking and opportunities to receive alerts
when prices change. Price transparency allows buyers to evaluate the relative
appeal of different offers. Even so, finding the best price offers can be time
consuming, so eBay, Amazon and many other online retailers notify customers
of price and product availability changes. Consumers can be willing to pay
higher prices and feel less regret (that they’ve made the wrong purchase) when
prices are transparent and stable (Hanna et al. 2019).
Place Distribution channels for services are usually more direct than for
many physical goods. Because services are intangible, the services marketer is
less concerned with storage, the production and consumption is often
simultaneous, and the personal nature of services means direct contact with the
service provider (or at best its agent) is desirable. Agents are used when the
individual service provider cannot offer a sufficiently wide selection for
customers. Consequently, specialist agents are often used for the marketing of
travel, insurance and entertainment. However, digital channels are increasing
direct dealings with the service provider.
Growth for many service companies means opening new facilities in new
locations. Whereas producers of physical goods can expand production at one
site to serve the needs of a geographically spread market, the simultaneous
production and consumption of hotel, banking, catering, retailing and
accounting services, for example, means expansion often means
following a multi-site strategy. The evaluation of store locations
is therefore a critical skill for services marketers. Much of the success of top
European supermarket chains has been due to their ability to choose profitable
new sites for their retailing operations.
People Because of the simultaneity of production and consumption in
services, the firm’s personnel occupy a key position in influencing customer
perceptions of product quality (Rafiq and Ahmed 1992). In fact, service quality
is inseparable from the quality of the service provider. Without courteous,
efficient and motivated staff, service organizations will lose customers. An
important marketing task, then, is to set standards to improve the quality of
service provided by employees and monitor their performance. Without
training and control, employees tend to be variable in their performance,
leading to variable service quality. Service providers need to adopt a customer￾first attitude rather than put their own convenience and enjoyment before theircustomers’. However, developments in AI and robotics technologies means
service robots are replacing their human counterparts in certain service
encounters. Robots can reduce cost, remove errors, and increase efficiency and
convenience for the customer, but firms should consider customer reactions
and reassure them on their first encounters with robots (Shin and Jeong 2020;
Tojib et al. 2022). Robots are being used in restaurants, travel and healthcare
contexts, but it has been found to be important to manage robot performance
and prominence when improving service systems and processes. Furthermore,
research suggests placing robots at the service forefront ‘may be a double￾edged sword creating a mesmerising moment of eye candy wonder filled with
aesthetic appeal and hedonic pleasure while undermining the sensorial and
utilitarian values of the robot restaurant experience’ (Wu et al. 2021).
Marketers, then, should examine the role played by customers in the
service environment and seek to eliminate harmful interactions, whether
delivered by human or robot. For example, the enjoyment of a restaurant meal
or air travel will very much depend on the actions of other customers. At
seasonal festival times and special events, restaurants are often in demand by
groups of work colleagues for staff parties. These can be rowdy affairs that can
detract from the pleasure of regular patrons. This situation needs to be
managed, perhaps by segregating the two types of customer in some way.
Physical evidence Physical evidence is the environment in which the
service is delivered, and any tangible goods that facilitate the performance and
communication of the service. Customers look for clues to the likely quality of
a service by inspecting the tangible evidence. For example, prospective
customers may gaze through a restaurant window to check the appearance of
the waiters, the décor and furnishings. The ambience of a retail store is highly
dependent on décor, and colour can play an important role in establishing
mood because colour has meaning. For example, black signifies strength and
power, whereas green suggests mildness. The interior of jet aircraft is pastel￾coloured to promote a feeling of calmness, whereas many nightclubs are
brightly coloured, with flashing lights to give a sense of excitement.
The layout of a service operation can be a compromise between the
operation’s need for efficiency and marketing’s desire to serve the customer
effectively. For example, the temptation to squeeze in an extra table at a
restaurant or extra seating in an aircraft may be at the expense of customer
comfort.page 448
Process This describes the procedures, mechanisms and flow of activities
by which a service is acquired. Process decisions radically affect how a service
is delivered to customers. For example, a self-service cafeteria is very different
to a restaurant. Marketing managers need to know whether self-service is
acceptable (or indeed desirable). Queuing may provide an opportunity to
create a differential advantage by reduction/elimination, or making the time
spent waiting more enjoyable. Certainly, waiting for service is a common
experience for customers, and a strong determinant of overall satisfaction with
the service and customer loyalty. Research has shown an attractive waiting
environment can prevent customers becoming irritated or bored very quickly,
even though they may have to wait a long time. Both appraisal of the wait and
satisfaction with the service improved when the attractiveness of the waiting
environment (measured by atmosphere, cleanliness, spaciousness and climate)
was rated higher (Pruyn and Smidts 1998). Providing a more effective service
(shorter queues) may be at odds with operations, as the remedy may be to
employ more staff.
Reducing delivery time – for example, the time between ordering a meal
and receiving it – can also improve service quality. As discussed earlier, this
need not necessarily cost more if customers can be persuaded to become
involved in the production process, as successfully reflected in the growth of
self-service breakfast bars in hotels.
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapter Detailed Review
1. The service industries
Sectors making up the service industries vary considerably and are constantly
evolving as new service concepts are developed, for example web developers and
social media engagement analysts.
Various forces are driving the changes, such as technological innovations and
changing patterns of ownership.
Sectors included are creative industries, government service, financial services,
hospitality, travel and tourism, personal care, property management, retailing and
non-profit organizations.
2. The nature and special characteristics of services
Services are a special kind of product that may require special understanding and
special marketing efforts because of their special characteristics.
The key characteristics of pure services are intangibility (they cannot be touched,
tasted or smelled), inseparability (production and consumption takes place at thepage 449
same time, e.g. a haircut), variability (service quality may vary, making
standardization difficult), and perishability (consumption cannot be stored, e.g. a
hotel room).
3. Managing service quality, productivity and staff
Key service quality concepts are: customer service quality and
meeting expectations; service productivity; service delivery and the positioning of
service. Customers may be disappointed with service quality if their service
perceptions fail to meet their expectations. This may result from four barriers: the
misconception barrier (management’s misunderstanding of what the customer
expects); the inadequate resources barrier (management provides inadequate
resources); the inadequate delivery barrier (management fails to select, train and
adequately reward staff); and the exaggerated promises barrier (management
causes expectations to be too high because of exaggerated promises).
Service productivity can be improved without reducing service quality by using
technology (e.g. automatic cash dispensers), customer involvement in production
(e.g. self-service petrol stations), and balancing supply and demand (e.g.
differential pricing to smooth demand).
Staff are critical in service operations because they are often in contact with
customers. The starting point is the selection of suitable people; socialization
allows the recruit to experience the culture and tasks of the organization;
empowerment gives them the authority to solve customer problems; they need to
be trained and motivated; and evaluation is required so staff understand how their
performance standards relate to customer satisfaction.
4. How to position a service organization or brand
Positioning involves the choice of target market (where to compete) and the
creation of a differential advantage (how to compete). These decisions are
common to both physical products and services. However, because of the special
characteristics of services, it is useful for the services marketer to consider not
only the classical Four-Ps marketing mix but also an additional Three-Ps – people,
physical evidence and process – when deciding how to meet customer needs and
create a differential advantage.
5. The services marketing mix
The services marketing mix consists of Seven-Ps: product, price, place,
promotion, people (important because of the high customer contact characteristic
of services), physical evidence (important because customers look for cues to the
likely quality of a service by inspecting the physical evidence, e.g. décor) and
process (because the process of supplying a service affects perceived service
quality).

CASE 21
SERVING UP
SUSTAINABILITY: THE
IMPETUS FOR GREENER
FAST-FOOD OUTLETS
Introduction
This case study focuses on the impetus for fast-food outlets to become more sustainable in all
their business practices. In an effort to adopt the principles of the UN Sustainable Development
Goals and specific national government commitments, combined with investor pressure and
pressure from conscious consumers, fast-food outlets such as Leon offer customers healthier
sustainable fast-food options. Leon embraces a sustainability strategy that values natural
resources, reduces and recycles waste, and supports fair-trade companies. Furthermore, Leonpage 455
pays its staff above the national living wage and promotes flexible work practices, which
somewhat redresses the poor reputation of fast-food companies employees’ working
conditions. There are other styles of fast-food outlet that embrace similar principles and
practices, such as Itsu, Tossed and Crussh.
Fast-food companies such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Domino’s, Subway, KFC and Pizza Hut
have also been prompted to develop and implement sustainable practices, and have set
science-based targets to reduce their gas emissions, reduce their carbon footprints and
enhance their traceability practices. This case explores the rate and extent of progress in the
sector in developing and implementing sustainable and ethical practices, and explores issues
such as responsible food sourcing, adoption of new technology that augments sustainability,
process redesign, inward and outward distribution challenges, ethical consideration of human
resources, and managing customers and other stakeholder expectations.
The Sustainability Agenda
In 2015, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by all United Nations
Member States. It comprises 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is a ‘call to
action’ by all countries to improve health and education, end poverty, reduce inequality and
support economic growth, while tackling climate change and working to preserve our planet
(United Nations 2022). This agenda has prompted national governments to develop specific
economic and sustainable plans and targets in various sectors to support the development and
implementation of these initiatives for business and consumers alike. Likewise, conscious
consumers are aware of these sustainability goals and are anxious to support sustainable and
ethical practices for the planet and the greater good of society and future generations.

Conscious Consumption
In recent years, consumers have become more health conscious, environmentally and ethically
aware, and are becoming more responsible in their consumption habits and preferences and
want to support local businesses. Consumers are seeking out healthier food options and many
are concerned with animal welfare, with an increasing number preferring to eat more plant￾based foods and consume healthier beverages (Nimbly Technologies 2021b).
Even in these inflationary times, many consumers are willing to pay more forsustainable products and services. More consumers want to be reassured that the provenance
of the food they are eating is transparent, local, good quality and sustainable. Furthermore,
consumers want to know that employees are being treated fairly, most especially in terms of
their hours and remuneration. Fast-food companies are being actively challenged by
consumers to be more transparent in all aspects of their offering, both in terms of menu
transparency and communicating around healthy and sustainable food options.

The Evolution of the Fast-food Sector
The global fast-food market is forecast to attain a value of around US$886.5 billion by 2026
(Expert Market Research 2020). At present most fast-food companies have subscribed to
improving their respective environmental practices in operational terms by tackling food waste,
more responsible food sourcing, being more person-centred (for customers and employees)
(BigHospitality 2021), utilizing sustainable food packaging, reducing carbon delivery emissions,
recycling, investment in energy-efficient equipment, purchasing eco-friendly cleaning products,
reducing water usage, using sustainable furniture and fittings as well as consumables such as
LED light fittings, and marketing online as opposed to using mail drops (Voicu 2022).
The proliferation of food delivery apps, the adoption of innovative production strategies evident
in the rise in the ghost kitchen or cloud kitchen, multichannel ordering systems and expanded
delivery options will support the growth of the industry globally. Notable trends becoming more
prevalent in the fast-food industry include offering vegan options, revised children’s menus,
butter and flour alternatives, additional beverage choices, and the adoption of smart appliances
for energy savings and artificial intelligence (Team Linchpin 2021). Another facet in terms of
adaptation is that fast-food outlets will tend to be physically smaller, as remote ordering is being
used and restaurants and customers alike will focus more on online, drive-through and pick-up
options (Nimbly Technologies 2021a). There are a myriad of reasons for shrinking physical fast￾food outlets, namely more customers prefer to eat at home (with the mutual benefits of third￾party delivery agents) or on the move, and restaurateurs benefit financially when utilizing less
physical space, with less expensive leases, build and fit-out options, as well as lower labour
costs and additional energy overheads (Littman 2019).
The pressures of increased corporate governance, transparency and accountability, as well as
pressure from various stakeholders such as government and environmental agencies, fair-trade
organizations, animal welfare groups and ultimately the ‘conscious’ consumer, have promptedpage 456
fast-food organizations to become more committed to healthful, greener and ethical practices
that are progressive and impactful for future generations. The challenge for fast-food
organizations is to operationalize and communicate the impact of their CSR principles
(sustainable and ethical dimensions) as a matter of urgency.
A recent review in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics examined how fast
food has changed over the past 30 years. The findings highlighted that, while the number of
food categories has increased by 226 per cent, portion sizes have become larger, and calorie
content and sodium levels have increased as well. Given the rise in global obesity levels and
chronic disease, the authors argue that more effort needs to be made by fast-food outlets to
offer healthier choices, display calories per meal, to educate and empower consumers to make
more informed choices, restrict portion size, introduce calorie taxation and restrict restaurant
location (McCrory et al. 2019).
Greener and Leaner Options
A number of fast-food restaurants, such as Leon, have led the way in developing healthy
Mediterranean-style food offerings and embracing a sustainable strategy focused on three
specific goals: increasing the number of plants on our menu, renewable energy, and reducing
our use of plastics. Leon sources local and seasonal food, with a wide range of plant-based
food offerings through the development of a menu that offers a range of vegan and vegetarian
dishes, as well as sourcing all ingredients, particularly fish and meat, responsibly (Leon 2022).
Itsu, an Asian-inspired fast-food restaurant chain, offers nutritious dishes, with most options on
the menu at under 500 calories, and high in fibre, vitamins and proteins. Itsu has been in
business for 25 years, and its original shareholders, operators and senior staff still maintain
control of 70 per cent of the entire company. Itsu includes calorie information on its menu board
and food packaging, and full nutritional information can be found on its website. Itsu’s menu
offers one-third plant-based dishes, it offers to give a free lunch to loyal customers kept waiting
more than 90 seconds, and it has a half-price sale every evening, to avoid food waste (Itsu
2022).
Global Fast-food Chains Playing Catch-up on
Greener Ethical Practices
Globally well-established fast-food outlets such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Domino’s,
Subway, KFC and Pizza Hut have developed sustainable targets and practices in an effort to
implement environmentally sustainable practices, and are working to become greener. This
includes not only plastic-free packaging that is compostable and recyclable, but also
consideration of sourcing and traceability of sourced ingredients, reducing their carbon
footprint, utilization of alternative cooking oils, energy-friendly outlets, fair-trade coffee and/or
chocolate beans, and improved animal welfare practices, as well as laudable eco efforts by
Burger King in trialling plant-based menus. In January 2022, Burger King was the first major UK
fast-food restaurant chain to offer vegan nuggets. In 2021, it launched its Vegan Royale Burger,
which is prepared separately from animal-based products, and aims to make half of its menu
meat-free by 2030, to achieve a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 41 per cent.page 457
‘Adapting to customer preferences is a key focus at Burger King,’ says the company’s UK chief
executive Alasdair Murdoch. ‘We are committed to helping our guests make good decisions
about what they eat and drink, and providing them with informed choices’ (Sweney and Butler
2022).
Corporate sustainability is upheld by incremental change and proactive planning. Synchronizing
menus with seasonal products and buying food closer to where it is needed is worthwhile. This
implies greater care by corporations in sourcing key ingredients. Furthermore, fast-food
businesses are reviewing their packaging products and practices by reducing or eliminating
single-use plastics (straws, drink lids, bags and disposable cutlery) and replacing them with
more sustainable options (Chan 2022). Managing food waste, managing supplies (Bukowski
2021), adjusting menus and donating excess food is critical. The benefits for the fast-food
companies include reduced operating costs, capturing new target markets with new product
offerings and repositioning, and increasing competitive advantage (Chan 2022).
Ethical and Sustainable Human Resource
Management
The fast-food sector attracts and supports a flexible workforce, but has often experienced
additional scrutiny in terms of the long and unsociable hours and minimum wage rates many of
its employees experience. Currently, many fast-food outlets are experiencing issues attracting a
sufficient number of employees. There is broad agreement that while the short-term solutions of
reducing opening hours and menu items may be helpful in addressing staffing shortfalls, the
longer-term strategy involves addressing terms and conditions of employment to ensure the
sector has the workforce it needs to survive and thrive. While fast-food companies adhere to
specific employment legislation, coupled with their own operating standards, which have
improved significantly over time, the need to attract and retain a robust and flexible workforce
through better wages and incentives cannot be overstated (Thomas 2021).
Fast-food companies are aware that maintaining positive employee relations and employee
well-being will not only enhance their corporate reputation but will also attract the best
employees (Bhowal 2021). In terms of employee recruitment, promoting social equity and hiring
local community members to minimize the environmental footprint is the way to go (Chan
2022). Fast-food outlets have the potential to hire employees who are both customer-focused
and environmentally aware. There are implications for staff in terms of their training and
development. Most (potential) employees will be drawn to work and remain loyal to a company
that more closely aligns with their own values (Bhattacharya et al. 2022). Most food-preparation
personnel are already well trained and highly aware of minimizing food waste; furthermore the
trend of donating surplus food to local charities and shelters should become the norm.
Successful fast-food outlets base their standard operating procedures (SOPs) on the key
principles of maintaining and delivering consistent high-quality output in a timely and efficient
manner. Consequently, fast-food companies are constantly seeking to adapt their operations in
terms of leaner as well as more sustainable business models, and one of the elements that has
served them well in this is technology. Many fast-food chains are streamlining and
automating their outlets and replacing workers with self-order kiosks, AI and VR
software, and also robots (Huddleston 2021). This may reduce staffing requirements allowing
food service employees additional time to engage with customers, and reduce the time spent
on repetitive and menial tasks. Ultimately, companies realize that employee loyalty, and in turn
customer loyalty and retention, are key components of a sustainable business model.The Benefits of Sustainability Initiatives for Fast￾food Outlets
There are many benefits to additional sustainability initiatives for fast-food companies and
respective franchise outlets, such as increased positive corporate reputation, increased brand
loyalty, a potential growth in customer base, increased profits coupled with reduced costs, a
more effective supply chain, an innovative menu, increased employee engagement, and a
general future-proofing of the business and the environment (Burton-Hughes 2020). In the
current economic, political and ecological environment, the fast-food sector is contending with
energy supply and staffing issues, as well as extreme climate occurrences and natural
disasters that are linked to climate change. Consequently, the impetus lies with every individual
and business to seek to reduce their ecological footprint (Houston 2022).
Future Challenges
The vast majority of fast-food companies are making an effort to be responsive in addressing
sustainability and ethical issues such as minimizing food waste, adding more plant-based
options to menus, recycling, reducing emissions, responsible sourcing, sustainable packaging
and supporting minimum wage rates. However, environmentalists argue these initiatives are not
enough, that they are ‘too little too late’, when in fact businesses should be striving to be more
responsible and proactive, and offering their consumers and employees more progressive
choices (Hackenburg 2021). Positive, proactive health practices, sustainable and ethical
consumption are priorities for the consumer and therefore need to be for all businesses as well
(Deloitte 2022). Essentially, sustainability is the way forward for restaurants and food chain
(franchise) outlets to survive and thrive in an increasingly complex and challenging market
(Frew 2022).
Questions
1. Discuss the issues fast-food outlets should consider when developing and implementing
sustainable and ethical practices, and the implications for revising their services marketing
mix.
2. Describe the role technology could play in assisting sustainable business practices for fast￾food outlets. Comment on the benefits for consumers as well as for the fast-food brands.
3. The most important assets in all service-led organizations are their employees. What facets
of ethical and sustainable practices might apply to their roles, operational processes,
interactions with customers and day-to-day working practices that will impact employees the
most?
4. How might quality and productivity strategies impact fast-food outlets as well as the labour
market by becoming more sustainable and ethical?

CASE 22
SPILL THE BEANS:
CHIPOTLE’S SIGNATURE
FLAVOUR
Chipotle (Chih-poat-lay): The Little Chain That
Could
Chipotle was founded in 1993 by classically trained chef Steve Ells, with its first location in
Denver, Colorado (Walker and Merkley 2017). Soon afterwards, Chipotle realized success as a
fast-casual, Mexican cuisine-inspired restaurant. Ells quickly recognized the popularity of a
well-made burrito, selling an estimated 1,000 burritos per day out of his first Denver store. This
far exceeded the carefully calculated 107 burritos it was required to sell daily in order for the
pioneer Chipotle to be profitable (Walker and Merkley 2017; Chakravarty 2020). Given the
unexpected sales volumes and cash flow, Ells turned his eye towards expansion. He carefully
directed Chipotle towards rapid and substantial growth, establishing five additional Denver
stores in three short years, becoming a 14-store chain by 1998, five years after its conception
(Walker and Merkley 2017).
Just then, fast-food giant McDonald’s took a vested interest in the new up-and-comer. In 1998,
McDonald’s held a minority stake in the 14-store ‘chain that could’, shunting $50 million towards
growing and expanding the infantile Chipotle (Jones 2021). By the following year, McDonald’s
held majority control of the Chipotle company (Walker and Merkley 2017). McDonald’s offeredpage 460
substantial industry influence, monetary and executive support, along with a wealth of fast-food
and marketing knowledge, while benefiting from a percentage of Chipotle’s profits (Jones
2021). Without hesitation, Chipotle took advantage of the opportunity, scaled up faster than
anticipated and expanded to 500 bricks-and-mortar stores throughout the US by 2005 (Walker
and Merkley 2017; Plowman 2019). The following year saw Chipotle Mexican Grill declare its
first initial public offering (IPO). Consequently, Chipotle was the best US-based IPO for a
restaurant at the time (Chakravarty 2020).
Fast-forward to a short while later, in 2006, when McDonald’s sold back its shares to Chipotle to
the value of $1.5 billion, and the fast-food giant waved goodbye to its not-so-newbie partner
(Alhadlaq 2016; Jones 2021). Different speculations were floated as to the reason for this
strategic decision and the consequences for each party. Steve Easterbrook, former McDonald’s
CEO, although not involved in this move, shared in a 2015 shareholders’ meeting that ‘Chipotle
… had taken attention away from the core brand’ (that being McDonald’s) (Jones 2021).
Presumably, this contributed to McDonald’s decision to divest from its short-term partner so as
to focus all its attention, market influence, strategic innovations and, in no small part, budget, on
its own restaurant chain. Chipotle performed well following the split from its largest investor,
having gained substantial momentum in the fast-food sphere, with a presence on the New York
Stock Exchange, and its continued pursuit of expansion (Alhadlaq 2016). As of 2021, Chipotle
had a presence across the United States, Canada and Europe, with a whopping total of 2,966
stores (Statista 2021; Chipotle 2022b).
A Different Process: Fast-casual Dining and a
Quick Exit
Chipotle is something of an anomaly as a fast-casual style restaurant with a particular focus on
fresh ingredients and food preparation, and sustainable sourcing. The definition of fast-casual
dining, although varied, basically considers the price point and type of service of the institution.
Fast-casual restaurants are typically able to charge marginally higher prices for their food
offerings than are fast-food stores. Further, fast-casual restaurants do not offer full
table service but prepare food in full view of patrons and offer higher-quality foods
than fast-food restaurants (Walker and Merkley 2017). This puts Chipotle in a unique position,
competing against both fast-food chains and full-service restaurants, but perhaps perfectly
placed in the minds of consumers (Alhadlaq 2016). As consumers become more discerning and
health conscious, the Chipotle chain may be considered the ‘Goldilocks’ of on-the-go options –
‘just right’. At just the right price, just the right speed and just the right combination of ‘cheat
food’ and healthy ingredients, Chipotle may be well placed to prosper for a long time to come.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock
Chipotle restaurants augment the positive customer experience by preparing each dish in real
time, on an assembly-style line that is visible to patrons (Plowman 2019). The experience
allows customers to partake in a personalized experience, enhancing their service quality
perceptions as their meal preparation, or ‘dining’ process, is afforded a degree of transparency
not generally seen at fast-food chains. The experience also allows customers to engage with
Chipotle staff, who by many accounts are friendly and well trained, and add to the overall
positive customer experience.
Typically located in bustling urban areas, Chipotle challenges fast-food moguls like its ex,
McDonald’s, or Colonel Sanders at KFC, targeting similar market segments in terms of broad
appeal. However, due to Chipotle’s differentiated offerings in terms of its generally healthier
outlook on food preparation, its marketing efforts may also be directed towards narrower, more
focused and more specific target markets. While the larger fast-food chains have commonly
always focused large amounts of revenue and manpower on drive-through options, Chipotle
resisted for the longest time. Even now, Chipotle’s chief development officer, Tabassum
Zalotrawala, says never to call the Chipotlane a drive-through – ‘it is a pick-up lane’, she insists
(Klein 2022). Fair enough, Chipotlanes offer an access point for customers to simply collect
orders they’ve placed on digital devices. Zalotrawala asserts that it is what Chipotlanes lack
that prove these aren’t traditional drive-throughs: menu boards, excessive signage, multiple
windows, speakerphones, noise pollution and, perhaps most importantly, traffic (Klein 2022). All
of the above are almost mandatory for the likes of a McDonald’s or Burger King drive-through,
thus clearly differentiating the Chipotlane from other fast-food chain drive-throughs. As of June
2022, Zalotrawala can be quoted as saying that individual customers can pass in and out of the
Chipotlane in ‘no more than 30 seconds’. The Chipotlane is a true service innovation, even in
the world of fast foods.
‘We Do It By Being Real’
So, exactly what is Chipotle’s signature flavour? Let’s put it down to an uncomplicated menu,
mixed with fresh, sustainably sourced ingredients, a pinch of personalization in its dishes and
an abundance of well-looked-after, loyal employees … also known as a business model
(Walker and Merkley 2017).page 461
‘Chipotle was born of the radical belief that there is a connection between how food is raised
and prepared, and how it tastes’ (Chipotle 2022a). The Chipotle chain prides itself on its Earth￾friendly approach to ingredient-sourcing and food preparation. Chipotle restaurants prepare
fresh dishes daily, with no need for freezers, can openers, artificial flavours, colours or
preservatives. The chain’s complete list of high-quality ingredients tallies a total of just 53, all of
which are displayed on its website (Chipotle 2022a). This emphasizes its commitment to
transparency in ingredient-sourcing and food preparation. The chain is also renowned for its
inclination to source its fresh ingredients from small to mid-sized suppliers – with whom it
values close, long-term buyer–supplier relationships – as opposed to large corporations
(Plowman 2019). It has also made a concerted effort to make use of local farms (within 350
miles of a given store) as suppliers of the defined list of ingredients.
Chipotle’s close relationships with suppliers allow for a degree of flexibility and customization in
terms of its procurement strategy. Being a long-standing, and relatively ‘large’, customer of local
suppliers, Chipotle can be assured of a steady flow of fresh ingredients and stock readily
available as needed. Its carefully defined list of ingredients means that Chipotle and its
dedicated suppliers are well aware of exactly what will be needed and by when. In turn,
Chipotle restaurants can deliver carefully crafted meals at the express request of each
customer, rounding up to near-perfect process execution and increased service quality
experiences.
Although the ingredient list is only 53 items long, Chipotle still capitalizes on a personalized
service offering, allowing customers to effectively ‘create their own’ Mexican cuisine-inspired
meal. Customers begin by choosing their dish (foil-wrapped burrito, burrito bowl, hard-shell taco
or salad), followed by their choice of protein, then other ingredients including rice, legumes and
toppings (Walker and Merkley 2017).
‘Food with Integrity’
Chipotle prides itself on being committed to using local and organic produce, as well as ‘raising’
its meat responsibly, with animal welfare standards among the highest. This differentiates
Chipotle from other US-born fast-food chains, and certainly influences its approach
to its marketing mix (Chipotle 2022b). In 2013, Chipotle was championed as the
first big American restaurant of its kind to explicitly highlight genetically modified (GMO)
ingredients and dishes on its menu (Walker and Merkley 2017). Two years later, Chipotle
surpassed customer expectations of fast-food dining and committed itself to using only non￾GMO ingredients, including meat. This includes the promise to source antibiotic-free meat with
no added hormones (poultry, pork and beef alike) (Wilford 2016), again leaving Chipotle poised
as a rarity in the industry. Certainly it is no easy feat. Chipotle would rather suspend a major
pork supplier that violated its animal welfare standards, spend six months searching for a new
one and eradicate its menu of the protein choice in the meantime, than concede to inferior
meat-raising standards (Gilliard et al. 2017).Source: dennizn/Shutterstock
Granted, Chipotle may have been nudged towards its ‘Food with Integrity’ strategy slightly
quicker than intended; 2015 held some marketing misery and many non-returns for the fast￾casual chain, following near-consecutive Salmonella and Escherichia coli outbreaks in different
US states, traced back to Chipotle as the source (Plowman 2019). Despite this blow to its share
price (Gilliard et al. 2017), the incidents caused Chipotle to readjust its focus, with an eye to
food safety. So began the era of Food with ‘extra’ Integrity at Chipotle, affording the chain the
opportunity to rebrand itself, and launch itself back to the top of consumers’ choices.
The chain supplements this positioning strategy with its respect towards the environment.
Chipotle is well aligned to eco-friendly initiatives, committed to recycling its own waste and
diverting it from landfill (Chipotle 2022b). Restaurants in the chain are known to donate old grills
and other equipment to non-profit companies, reducing overall waste output (Alhadlaq 2016).
Even by sourcing ingredients locally and from smaller farmers, Chipotle actively decreases its
carbon footprint by bypassing the need for extensive air freight or shipping. Chipotle CEO Brian
Niccol reiterates the chain’s commitment to Food with Integrity, stating that ‘sustainability is and
always will be a strategic priority for Chipotle. I, along with the rest of the organization, strongly
believe that how we grow our food is how we grow our future’ (Chipotle 2022b). In constant
pursuit of sustainable farming and eco-friendly processes, Chipotle attracts customers from an
additional market segment – those customers who value Earth-friendly operations and service
execution, even in a fast-casual food setting. Consumers that strictly adhere to eating meats
and vegetables that are sustainably and responsibly grown or farmed now have an appealing,
transparent on-the-go option. Regulatory bodies and environmental protection groups have
further motivated Chipotle to render services in a sustainable manner. This adds a new
dimension to Chipotle’s promotional strategy, allowing its marketers to exploit the ‘responsible
farming and organic produce’ perspective. The twist on its promotional content enhances
Chipotle’s reach of alternative markets and ultimately reinforces its personalized service model.
Here’s the (Rest of the) Spice
The production of healthier, yet still on-the-go style cuisine lends motivation to the pricing model
of services rendered by Chipotle. Given its sustainable sourcing methods and exact care taken
to prepare fresh, personalized meal options, Chipotle has a moderately higher price point than
that of comparable competitors, like Taco Bell for example (Bhasin 2019). Customers are
evidently happy to concede, and this also contributes to the maintenance of a particular brand
image and power of the Chipotle brand. Chipotle magnifies its brand image as a ‘real food, real
people’ food chain by taking a genuine interest in the support of its employees. The chain ispage 462
lauded for the way in which it takes care of its tens of thousands of staff. The chain offers real
culinary training, career opportunities and a decent benefits package to its loyal employees
(Chipotle 2022b), thus monetizing skills gaps and looking after its people with great care and
effort.
Chipotle integrates quick service, healthy(ish) eating and casual ‘dining’ with ease and
sophistication, which ultimately allows Chipotle to relish in increased revenue and profits, and
ample opportunity for market expansion afforded by fast-casual restaurants rendering services
of superior quality. The fast-casual dining segment is relatively competitive, but Chipotle
continues to position itself in a unique manner within the market, by maintaining its
personalized service model. This encompasses its focus on quick delivery of
freshly prepared meals made from high-quality ingredients, accompanied by a friendly Chipotle
smile.
Questions
1. Evaluate Chipotle’s pricing strategy and the factors that could influence this strategy.
2. Discuss how Chipotle employs the additional Three-Ps of services marketing.
3. Briefly discuss the factors that Chipotle should consider when reviewing its positioning
within the market.

ood communications are the lifeblood of successful market-orientated
firms and their brands, but creating good communications presents many
challenges. As discussed in Chapter 8, all firms need to communicate
what they stand for and the benefits they have on offer, if they are to earn their
customers’ trust. Trust is at the core of a brand’s very existence (Hegarty
2011). However, the way in which businesses communicate with their
audiences is constantly evolving. Technology and digital media are reshaping
both the tools and the media channels through which we communicate. Themartech landscape discussed in Chapter 10 is reshaping how marketing and
technology firms are joining together and revolutionizing the communications
industry. There are also more channels and opportunities for a customer to
engage with a brand. In Europe, there are 11,000 television channels and pay￾on-demand video services (Easton 2020). Channels compete to grab the
attention of consumers; around the world tens of millions of firms’ websites
provide product and marketing information to stimulate buyer behaviour.
Social media tools are used by individuals and firms as a means of extending
their communication networks.
This increase in the number of opportunities to engage and interact with
customers has created a need for better coordination of all an organization’s
communications activities. Additionally, to manage the challenges of the
changing communication environment and the proliferation of channels,
organizations wishing to promote themselves must understand which
communications tools to use in which situations. They must also consider
operational issues associated with the management of promotional campaigns,
and assess whether to place responsibility for campaigns with an internal
department or to employ external specialist communication agencies.
Finding communication solutions to these challenges has been a driver of
change in the communication environment and has led to the integrated
marketing communications (IMC) school of thought.
This chapter explores IMC, the benefits of integration, and how brand
messages, the tools and the media channels can be managed to develop
coordinated communication strategies that maximize the efficiency and
effectiveness of the promotional element of the marketing mix.
The chapter begins with IMC as an approach to developing
communication, then looks at the planning process and how to develop
communication strategies and campaigns. Next, we explore the elements of
IMC, including the principles of communication, the importance of the
message, the communication tools and their characteristics, and the media
channels. We touch on the people involved in communications and finally
consider communication contexts: business to business (B2B) and business to
consumer (B2C). There is more detailed coverage of related topics: Chapter 13
focuses in detail on mass communications tools by examining advertising, the
media, sales promotions and public relations (PR); Chapter 14 explores the
digital marketing and social media landscape; Chapter 15 discusses direct
communications tools – personal selling and sales management, directpage 467
marketing and customer relationship management; Chapter 16 examines
distribution and related issues for place-based marketing.

Reach the People Through Trusted Communications
Print newspapers used to be a major advertising channel, but digital media has challenged
print media, especially newspapers, resulting in declining readerships, loss of relevance and
being seen as outmoded by new generations of readers (e.g. millennials and Gen X)
compared with social media and on-demand newsfeeds. However, newspapers are creators
of one of the most important and valuable commodities for digital marketing: well-written
content, which is current, up to the minute and on trend.
Source: T. Schneider/Shutterstock
The challenge for many newspaper brands, then, is how to survive and monetize their
content. Research initially found putting news content behind a paywall drove
away readers and caused a decline in a publication’s visitor numbers. Both
regular readers and frequent casual visitors stayed away, but this did have a positive impact
on demand for the print versions of publications. These conflicting findings also potentially
impact on future revenue from digital advertising – a dilemma for newspapers, seemingly
with no straightforward solutions. However, if newspapers are able to get the balance right,
with subscription packages and freemium pricing plans that are attractive to readers, they
can have richer information on customers, and produce more informed and targeted digital
advertising.

Integrated Marketing Communications
Approach
The IMC school of thought aims to move the emphasis of communications
away from a step-by-step, linear, transactional process to an ongoing relational
dialogue. Another fundamental shift is to move away from transactional
communications to make communications customer-centred by capturing and
using the reality of how individuals and businesses engage and encounter
communications.
The transactional approach means promotional campaigns are designed to
meet specific communication objectives such as creating awareness or
stimulating action, using separate communications tools. In using this
approach, rarely were there linkages between the messages carried by each
different communication tool. For example, in the past, Heinz had a long￾running television advertising campaign for its baked beans, which aimed to
position the product as a quality brand. However, at times, it also used sales
promotion techniques (e.g. selling a multipack of four cans for the price of
three) to combat supermarket value brands being sold at a few pence per can,
although there were no explicit links between the television advertising
campaign and the sales promotion initiatives. Now Heinz takes a very different
approach. Its highly successful ‘Grow Your Own’ campaign sought to remindpage 468
sauce lovers across Europe about the quality of the brand and encourage
engagement. This IMC campaign was activated via a mobile app, had its own
Facebook page and was supported by a £1 million television campaign.
Additionally, there was also in-store activation of the campaign, with on-pack
labelling featuring the ‘Grow Your Own’ message, while at selected stores
shoppers could also pick up a free packet of seeds. The campaign encouraged
the whole family to take part. School children got involved and teachers were
asked to sign up to take part in an educational aspect of the campaign (Glenday
2017).
Heinz continues to produce innovative and engaging campaigns,
recognizing the status of the marketing environment and integrating the latest
technology to get closer to its customers. In Canada, in summer 2021, people
started to travel again as Covid restrictions eased, and this caused traffic
problems. With this in mind, the marketing team at Heinz Canada partnered
with traffic navigation app Waze and creative agency Rethink to devise an
award-winning campaign. Using real-time data and Waze’s speed-tracking
system, Heinz targeted travellers stuck in traffic jams. If they were moving at
less than 0.045 km/h (the speed at which ketchup pours from a
bottle) they received an instant voucher for free Heinz Ketchup
and a Burger King Whopper. To raise awareness, an IMC campaign used
outdoor advertising boards on the roadside, social media, radio ads and
Spotify. The campaign was highly successful for all involved (Ormesher
2022b).
IMC campaigns seek to rationalize the approach to communications by
focusing on developing relational and coordinated communication strategies. It
therefore becomes possible to bring together the communication tools,
techniques, messages and media channels favoured by a target audience. It is
difficult to pinpoint exactly when this change in communication planning took
place: however IMC began to be accepted as a valid approach for
communications in the early 1990s. Duncan and Everett (1993) commented
that the new customer-focused, technology-driven communications were an
orchestration, whole egg, seamless communication approach, while Schultz
(1993) referred to it as ‘the process of developing and implementing various
forms of persuasive communication programs with customers and prospects
over time’. From the mid-1990s, IMC adoption has become increasingly
widespread, and now IMC means integrating all useable promotional tools and
appropriate media to deliver synergistic communication campaigns. In other
words, promotional campaigns select the most appropriate tools and channelsthat can be used in harmony with one another to maximize communication
effectiveness so the sum is greater than the individual parts.
The principles of IMC are used to coordinate marketing communications
tools, branding, images, logos and CRM strategies to deliver a clear,
consistent, credible and competitive message about a brand, its products and
services. The objective is to position products and organizations clearly and
distinctively in the marketplace by providing target audiences with multiple
opportunities to see, hear, read and/or interact with consistent marketing
messages. As we discussed in Chapter 7, successful positioning is associated
with products and services being favourably positioned in the minds of target
audiences. According to Hegarty (2011), ‘A brand is the most valuable piece of
real estate in the world: a corner of someone’s mind.’ IMC facilitates the
positioning process by sending out consistent messages through all the
components of the promotional mix, and in doing so reinforces the core
message. LinkedIn’s latest IMC campaign sought to raise awareness of the
power of community and career progression. The campaign – launched in the
UK, India and Germany – showed dinner table conversation among LinkedIn
members finding the right seat. The campaign deployed video on demand,
television, paid social media, online video and outdoor search engine
marketing to reach target markets. The message of the campaign was about
working together to succeed, thinking outside the box about what is possible,
and that LinkedIn is there to help, support and inspire (Hutchinson 2022).
Drivers of IMC
Currently, advances in communication technology account for many changes
taking place in the marketing industry, but there are other key drivers that help
to explain why more organizations are adopting the IMC approach.
Organizational drivers focus on the benefits IMC can bring from an
operational perspective, for example streamlining communications activities
and creating opportunities for increased profits through efficiency gains. Many
organizations are faced with having to show greater accountability in the
communication budget and more measurable outcomes. IMC provides
opportunities to create competitive advantage through coordinated brand
development, and, across an organization, can deliver improved productivity
and greater focus.
Target-market-based drivers focus on changes affecting the delivery of
communication messages. For example, the cost and availability of mediapage 469
channels is changing. Audiences are becoming more fragmented, and
organizations are using different media and different timings to grab the
attention of their audiences. Technology-enabled communications are used
more frequently as target audiences’ skills and communication literacy are
increasing.
Communication drivers focus on the potential benefits associated with the
delivery of the message (e.g. increased effectiveness of the message) through
constant reinforcement of the core ideas, consistent product and brand
communication across a range of touchpoints, less confusion over the meaning
of the message, and opportunities to build brand reputation and position clearly
for a product, brand or firm.
For marketing managers, achieving high levels of consistency across a
range of communications is challenging. On the one hand, well-planned IMC
campaigns can contribute to the development of competitive advantage,
building stronger relationships between a brand and its stakeholders, improved
consistency and clearer positioning of brands in the minds of
customers. This approach can also be a source of further
advantages insofar as there are opportunities to:
reduce costs by standardizing communication messages across a selected
promotional mix
create synergies between the use of communication tools; for example,
television advertising can be linked to in-store sales promotions and social
media, so members of a target audience receive a consistent message
wherever they ‘touch’ an IMC campaign
reinforce competitive advantage, by creating a more consistent
communication experience for customers; IMC campaigns potentially
garner greater advantage than isolated campaigns – the Premier League, for
example, reinvented its image to attract more sponsors; the new image
heralded the new market positioning for the brand, and sought to shed the
brand’s corporate image and focus more on the personality and story of the
brand (Roderick 2016)
increased knowledge of consumer preferences, brand and channel choices
(Tafesse and Kitchen 2017).
See Exhibit 12.1 for the Premier League’s new visual image.

On the other hand, organizations can change management structures and
organizational culture to accommodate IMC, and creativity can be stifled if
campaigns go wrong – which they can do on a grander scale and with greater
potential to damage a brand’s reputation. Increased use of digital channels and
social media is intensifying the demands on both creating and controlling
campaigns. There are now many more opportunities to ‘touch’ a brand.
Marketers must consider the multiple touchpoints in a customer journey if they
are to bridge the gap between the physical and digital world (Bylykbashi
2015). Furthermore, according to Fill (2011), other potential disadvantages of
adopting an IMC approach are that it:
requires greater management commitment throughout the development and
implementation of the IMC campaign
requires increased agency commitment with the integration of all the stages
across several platforms, media and promotional tools, leading to a need for
more involvement from all agencies involved
encourages uniformity, since increased commitment from management and
agencies can lead to demand for uniformity and might stifle creativity.
Managers should consider the advantages and disadvantages when planning
and developing an IMC approach to campaigns.
Planning for Integrated Marketing
CommunicationsSo far, we have discovered many drivers are now encouraging wider uptake of
IMC as a framework for planning and managing communication campaigns
and initiatives. We have, however, also identified several management
considerations and challenges to be addressed if a brand is to maximize the
potential advantages and avoid the disadvantages of adopting an IMC
approach. A framework for applying an IMC approach is presented in Figure
12.1.
FIGURE 12.1
A framework for implementing integrated marketing communications
Based on: Caemmerer (2009)
Marketing strategy and situation analysispage 470
IMC is a framework for planning the use of the promotional mix. Therefore, it
is important to remember that the objectives, the brand positioning statement
and more come from the marketing strategy (see Chapter 17 for more details).
Opportunities identified from the marketing situation analysis and the target
market analysis should be captured to enable use of promotions to contribute
to the creation of differential advantage. This initial stage in the
planning framework serves to ensure integration between the
marketing strategy and promotional mix selection. The analysis should also
clarify the overarching objectives that guide the campaign. The promotional
mix decisions depend on the marketing strategy, competitive positioning and
target market. For example, target market definition will lead to an
understanding of the needs of the target audiences and how those audiences
can be reached by different promotional tools and media channels.
Furthermore, differential advantage will affect message decisions.
IMC campaign objectives
Once issues from the marketing strategy and situation analysis have been
decided, communication objectives will be set and promotional options
selected (e.g. advertising, digital media, direct marketing and personal selling)
to form a brand-led approach. However, it should be noted that among
practitioners there is debate over which comes first – the marketing and brand
strategy or the objectives for the communication campaign. There are benefits
to following a top-down, market-strategy-driven, brand-led approach, as it
means the marketing team are aware of what is required to position the brand
and can tailor communications accordingly. This approach means campaigns
are coordinated and efficient. In other words, they select promotional tools that
are affordable, desirable or in vogue, with only a limited consideration of the
IMC campaign objectives. This approach means campaigns can become
disjointed and inefficient, and the outcome can be that they perform poorly and
achieve little for the brand when driven by the promotional tools rather than
the marketing and branding strategy. (Further discussion of these issues and
objectives for specific communication tools can be found in in Chapters 13, 14
and 15; also see Marketing in Action 12.1.)page 471
MARKETING IN ACTION 12.1
Goldfish Crackers Grab Attention
Zulu Alpha Kilo is an independent creative agency with a difference. It is cheeky, irreverent
and offers its clients revolutionary creative ideas. It is also an award-winning agency, with
clients from Subaru and Puma to Harley-Davidson and Coca-Cola. So when Goldfish
crackers went to the agency with the marketing communication objective of connecting to its
target audience of 13 to 17 year olds, the agency wanted to do something radical.
Source: Noel Powell/Shutterstock
Zulu Alpha Kilo researched the target audience, who are known for having short attention
spans and found social media and gaming offered a way to connect. Its creative solution
was the Focus Face Off Lens.
This campaign used gamification and, to join the game, target teenagers had to focus on a
Goldfish cracker slowing coming out of a bottle of ketchup on the Face Off video. If they
stayed hooked for more than 9 seconds (the attention span of a real goldfish), they received
a discount code. Eye-tracking technology was used in the game and players were
encouraged to share their scores with friends on Snapchat.
The campaign built brand awareness among the target audience through an immersive
experience.

Creative agency selectionpage 472
Once the objectives are set, the next step is to select creative agencies (which
includes using internal teams and departments) to develop a communication
brief and determine the deliverables. Once the creative brief has been
developed, creative agencies will be selected to pitch for the campaign. (Read
Marketing in Action 12.1 to find out how Zulu Alpha Kilo worked with
Goldfish crackers to grab teenagers’ attention.) If communications are handled
by an internal marketing team, there should still be a briefing document that
sets out the core requirement of the campaign and which acts as a guide for
everyone in terms of the message, target audiences, tone, budget and
deliverables. Agencies and/or internal departments will prepare a pitch for the
client that shows how their ideas and use of the communication budget will
meet the client’s requirements. Marketing managers must decide how to
determine whether an agency can deliver on its promises. (The issue of agency
selection is revisited in Chapter 13.) A full-service agency should offer the
capacity to provide all the promotional tools. Some agencies – such as
advertising agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH) – offer a complete service
across all the communication tools. However, there are also specialist agencies
with particular expertise (e.g. Fever PR, an agency specializing in public
relations online and offline) or an internal marketing team.
Once the agency selection is complete, the creative teams, account
managers and other service providers will work together to produce each of the
elements of the campaign. Media schedulers will be involved in making sure
any media requirements are available and fulfilled. A Gantt chart or similar
project management timetable will be set out as a guide, to make sure each of
the elements of the campaign is ready at the prescribed time. Timing is very
important to IMC campaigns, especially as different tools might be required to
fulfil different functions, and digital technology is enabling brands to
communicate with their supporters in real time.
The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) has always been positioned as
quintessentially English, and its approaches to communication have fitted this
stance. However, the LTA teamed up with sponsor Nature Valley in an IMC
campaign that aimed to encourage the British public to go out and play tennis,
in order to demonstrate the association’s commitment to encouraging greater
participation in the sport (LTA 2018).The advantage of using one agency is better communication and specialist
expertise, but using several agencies gives clients more flexibility regarding
the choice of the best agencies to handle each media type (Weissberg 2008). A
disadvantage of using several agencies, however, is that this can lead to
conflict regarding who is paid for what and who takes charge.
Please note, IMC is not restricted to consumer markets. Furthermore,
relationships between clients and agencies are fundamental to the success of
communication initiatives. (Client – agency relationships are covered in detail
in Chapter 13.)
Promotional mix selection
Communication objectives help to determine which communication tools to
include in a campaign. Furthermore, the creative pitch enables an agency to
make suggestions about which tools are most likely to achieve the campaign
objectives set by the client. Ultimately, the client (the firm commissioning the
campaign) decides which tools to use, which creative message and
combination of agencies represent the best value, and which are likely to
achieve their communication aims. Sportswear brand Under Armour made a
commitment to promoting youth sports and tackling barriers to participation.
For its campaign ‘The Only Way Is Through’, which strove to motivate people
to be the best version of themselves, the brand used television, digital and
social media channels to get the message across about wider participation in
sport (Under Armour 2022).
Campaign development and implementation
At this stage, the promotional mix decision is finalized, and the message and
creative execution confirmed. Other major decisions taken at this stage are
media channel selection, planning and scheduling. The media decision will
affect the budget. For example, television advertising reaches a large television
audience but can be expensive, whereas print media advertising using regional
newspapers can be a relatively low-cost option but will not have the same
reach, while digital platforms offer scope for interactive campaigns that can
foster high levels of engagement. The relative merits of the different media
channels are discussed later in this chapter and in Chapter 13.page 473
Evaluation
Following implementation, each element of the campaign will be evaluated to
assess its overall effectiveness. Evaluation should take place at all stages of the
campaign, including during pre-testing, tracking studies and post-testing. This
approach can help to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the IMC
campaign. Measurements are taken to determine the extent to which a
campaign has achieved communication objectives and whether it is moving
target audiences in the planned direction. Evaluation also feeds in to future
planning. Digital channels provide much scope for monitoring and measuring
the effectiveness of campaigns (see Chapter 6 for a discussion of digital
marketing analysis).
Future planning
As noted in the previous section, following the implementation of an IMC
campaign, each of the elements should be reviewed. Findings from this review
should be fed back and recorded to inform the development of future
campaigns. Throughout the campaign, information should be fed back. While
the planning framework shows a linear process that moves from one stage to
the next, in reality, the process is rather more iterative, with information and
learning influencing and informing developments at every stage.
This section has examined the IMC planning process. The next section
looks at the elements that underpin the IMC planning process and are
fundamental to its successful application: the message, the tools, the media
channels and the contexts.
Elements of Integrated Marketing
Communications
To survive, firms need to communicate with their customers; marketing
messages tell buyers about the meaning of a brand and the benefits it can
deliver. Arguably, 50 years ago delivering a message to a target audience was
relatively straightforward: there was a small number of commercial television
and radio channels and a few well-known printed publications, whicha marketer might use to get the message across. Now the communications
environment has changed – it is more complex, integrated and universal. There
are more interconnections between the core elements of communications to
consider when planning an IMC campaign. The core elements are:
the message, which is used to position a product, brand and/or an
organization in the minds of the customer
the tools – the six key methods that provide the means of achieving
communication objectives
the media, which are the channels that carry the message to the audience
the people who collectively are responsible for creating, planning, managing
and implementing the communication campaign
the context – the setting in which communication takes place.
See Table 12.1 for examples of each element.

The message
The function of the message and how it might be communicated to target
audiences involves using both simple and complex processes.
Messages are very important as they not only transfer information from a
message’s sender to its recipient, but they also determine the nature of a
relationship, establish credibility, set the tone for a conversation, and cross
tangible and intangible boundaries. Effective messages can become so
powerful they can be heard around the globe when used with suitable mediapage 474
channels. For example, when Irish rock star Bob Geldof wanted to
communicate the message that millions of people in Africa were dying of
starvation, he decided to use a rock concert to get the message across to young
audiences around the world. His core message was famine relief for Africa.
The rock concert was Live Aid 1985. This concert was transmitted from the
UK and the US on live television. Geldof’s message brought together a global
audience, united music and youth, and spread the message of famine relief to
400 million television viewers in more than 50 countries (Hegarty 2011).
In marketing, messages take on a special meaning – they are not mercurial
asides between individuals, or unplanned, off-the-cuff remarks, but are
carefully planned and crafted. Messages play an important role in positioning.
To create effective messages, marketers need to consider the credibility of the
message and its source (Kelman 1961). For a target audience to engage with a
marketing message, it has to be attractive and interesting, and the source (the
sender of the message) has to be perceived as credible and believable to have
the power to deliver the message promise. The next step is to establish suitable
brand messages to communicate with target audiences.
As discussed earlier, product (Chapter 9) and service (Chapter 11) brands
are distinctive market offerings that can be easily identified by target audiences
for whom they deliver a parcel of benefits. During the development of a brand,
its quality, value, features, name, design and packaging are determined. These
features of the brand can then be used in crafting marketing messages. When
Aston Manor Cider launched its first TV advert, it used brightly coloured
animation and hip-hop style, with breakdancers and DJ decks, to showcase its
Crumpton Oaks cider. The message to target customers was: this is an
innovative brand, which stands out from the competition (Wier 2022).
Marketing messages take many forms, for example emotional and rational
(information-based) appeals designed to stimulate responses to different types
of message appeals. Charities often use striking image appeals designed to
elicit an emotional response (see Exhibit 12.2).
EXHIBIT 12.2

disasterSource: Mircea Moira/Shutterstock
Information-based messages
Sometimes firms want to provide their customers with information to enable
them to make an informed decision about the brands they choose.
Increasingly, brands are using digital platforms to provide their customers
with the information they need to make their choices, as well as more
traditional print and broadcast channels.
Information-based messages use different formats. For example,
Weetabix’s ‘Incredible Inside’, a £10 million campaign, reached out to all its
customers with a television advert that aimed to remind them how important
their bodies are, and in doing so delivered hard facts. This style of message
delivery is sometimes referred to as ‘slice of life’. During the Covid-19
pandemic, Clorox spent an extra $50 million on advertising and sales
promotions, reminding customers how much they could trust the brand’s range
of disinfectant products and providing facts about their effectiveness in killing
99.9 per cent of germs (Clifford 2020).
Emotional messages
Sometimes messages are designed to stimulate a response and possibly
connect with the target audience through an emotion. Messages designed to
shock are often used not only to attract the attention of the target audiences but
also that of the wider media. For example, Procter & Gamble’s ‘Like A Girl’
campaign focused on a girl’s life to promote its Always brand, using
male/female perceptions, relationships and music to create a highly emotional
appeal. The brand extended the reach of its campaign by raising awareness ofperiod poverty and donating to Kind Direct, a not-for-profit charity that works
to end hygiene poverty. Thousands of young girls regularly miss school
because they do not have access to sanitary protection; this affects their
confidence, and they miss out on learning and experiences (Always 2018).
In Chapter 13, we explore messages in more detail and look at how to
create different types of message appeal – informative, interactive or
actionable. Now we are going to consider how the message is delivered
through the communication process.
The communication process: simple and complex
While messages are at the heart of the process, the actual way in which we
communicate is also very important. In this section, we examine the elements
of the simple communication model, which shows how a message is
transferred from one person to another. Then we consider how messages are
spread within and across communities.
A simple model of the communication process is shown in Figure 12.2.
The source (or communicator) encodes a message by translating the idea to be
communicated into a symbol consisting of words, pictures and numbers. Some
advertisements attempt to encode a message using the minimum number of
words, while others provide extensive detail. We explore message content later
in this section.
FIGURE 12.2
Simple model of communication
Noise – distractions and distortions during the communication process –
may prevent transmission to some of the target audience. A televisionpage 475
advertisement may not reach a member of the household because of
conversation or their telephone ringing. Similarly, a press advertisement may
not be noticed because of editorial competing for attention.
When a receiver sees or hears the message, it is decoded. This is the
process by which the receiver interprets the symbols transmitted by the source.
The aim is for the receiver’s decoding to coincide with the source’s encoding
process; the receiver thus interprets the message in the way intended by the
source. Messages that rely on words more than pictures can also be decoded
differently. For example, a message such as ‘the most advanced washing
machine in the world’ may be accepted by some receivers but rejected by
others.
Communicators need to understand their targets before encoding messages,
so they are credible. Otherwise the response may be disbelief and rejection. In
a personal selling situation, feedback from buyer to salesperson may be
immediate, such as when objections are raised or a sale is concluded. For other
types of marketing, such as advertising and sales promotion, feedback may
rely on marketing research to gauge reactions to commercials and increases in
sales due to incentives.
An important point to recognize in the communication process is the
sophistication of receivers and how they can play different roles in the wider
dissemination of the message. The simple model of communication explains
the basic concepts and transmission of a message from sender to receiver, but
the communication of a message rarely takes place in such isolation. Message
receivers interact with one another, and consequently can act as conduits to
spread messages further afield.
The message is transmitted through media such as television or posters,
which are selected for their ability to reach the desired target audience in the
desired way. Communication requirements may affect the choice of media. For
example, if the encoded message requires the product to be demonstrated, the
internet, television and cinema may be preferred to posters and printed
publications.
There are also other levels of complexity to consider: different message
recipients play different roles in the wider diffusion of messages. Katz and
Lazarsfeld (1955) found some individuals were able to exert greater influencethan others. These opinion leaders (Rogers 1983), as they have become known,
enjoy higher status within social groups, and their views are more highly
valued by other members of the social/peer group. Opinion leaders play an
important role in the communication process, as ‘they are receptive to new
ideas’, and are happy to try and buy new products and services; they are
prepared to lead opinion. Opinion formers are individuals who can exert
personal influence because of authority, education or status associated with the
objects of the communication process (Fill 2011); they shape opinion. The
influence of opinion formers is also important in the communication process. A
theatre critic writing reviews in a local or national newspaper or blogging
online has also become an important type of opinion former. For example, Elin
Kling is a Swedish fashion blogger who collaborated with H&M and then
became a fashion designer; Pete Cashmore, the Scottish founder of the famous
blog site Mashable, is a highly influential voice in technology, business, social
media and entertainment.
The simple model of communication suggests communications are
unidirectional, passing from sender to receiver. In the past, this model has been
used to explain the spread of many mass-marketing campaigns, but the world
of communications has become highly complicated and there are now many
ways for individuals and firms to communicate and interact. Indeed, the
boundaries between the pillars of the marketing mix are becoming eroded as
products and communications come closer together.
In a multichannel world where message receivers gather information from
multiple points such as websites, apps, a multitude of television channels,
printed publications and, perhaps more importantly, one another, a more
complex model is needed to understand how communication messages are
disseminated. Figure 12.3 shows the complexity of communication networks.
FIGURE 12.3
Complex model of communicationpage 476
Source: Adapted from Fill (2011)
Figure 12.3 shows how complex two-way linkages can form between
target audiences, opinion formers and leaders, the media (television, radio,
internet), digital sources of influence (e.g. websites, social media) and personal
sources of information (experiences). The implications for developing IMC
campaigns are that multiple two-way integrated communications become
formal and informal, which means message senders need to use multiple
methods and channels to ensure messages are received by the intended target
audience. For instance, a website selling innovative products (digital source)
may provide information which may then be picked up by a
journalist (opinion former) who does a review for a special￾interest magazine (mass media) that is read by the local computer expert
(opinion leader), who informs her friends (target audience). The
communication message potentially is the central core of a conversation
between multiple participants.
Read Mini Case 12.1 to see how conversations and storytelling can help to
spread a message.MINI CASE 12.1
Conversations, Storytelling and Happy Endings
Conversations
When Owen Baxter and Geoffrey Lewis (executives of the then-failing Hush Puppy brand of
shoes) had a conversation with a New York stylist, they were told Hush Puppies had
suddenly become hip in the clubs and downtown bars of Manhattan, and there were resale
shops in the Village in Soho where the Hush Puppies were being sold (Gladwell 2000).
Reportedly, what followed was that the shoes were chosen by fashion buyers to feature in
their new ranges and the basset hound (the symbol of the brand) was used by a Los
Angeles designer on his store in Hollywood. Sales of Hush Puppies quadrupled year on
year, and so the brand that had been on its way out was not only saved but became a
staple item in every trendy young American’s wardrobe. In this tale, the informal
communication network enabled the message to be filtered back from the target audience
(young people in East Village, Manhattan) to opinion leaders (fashion designers and
stylists) and eventually to more formal traditional mass-media communication channels.
Storytelling
Storytelling is part of our daily lives and helps us make sense of the complex world around
us. Often we become part of the story, and brands utilize storytelling as a platform for
developing meaning. John Hegarty, co-founder and former creative director of global
advertising agency BBH, is one of the world’s advertising aficionados. Hegarty advocates
that storytelling is probably the most powerful form of communication, as it can be used very
effectively to make brands memorable, saying: ‘Probably the most powerful form of
communication we have at our disposal is storytelling. It has been incorporated by virtually
every civilization into their culture. It is the simplest, most memorable device we have for
engaging, learning, entertaining and persuading’ (Hegarty 2011). However, he suggests
messages and stories need to be created for the screen-based culture (television,
computers, smartphones) so prevalent in modern society. To be successful in the screen￾based world of communications, it is important to get the balance right between visuals and
words. In many of the highly successful commercials for Levi’s 501 jeans, the story is a
visual narrative. For example, in the 1985 classic advert, set in a 1950s launderette, Nick
Kamen (the lead character) walks into the launderette wearing sunglasses, which he
proceeds to remove. He then fills the washing machine with soap powder, removes his top
and Levi’s and then, wearing just his boxer shorts, sits down to read a magazine while he
waits for his jeans to be washed. The slogan shown on screen at the end of the commercial,
‘Levi’s 501: the original shrink-to-fit jeans’, neatly brings the tale to an end.
Another tip – from William Goldman, award-winning novelist and screenwriter – is ‘Come in
late, leave early.’ What this means is the scriptwriter should leave space for the target
audience to fill in some of the gaps and should not over-explain. Scripts for commercials do
tend to be brief and give the creative director space to tell the story visually. According to
John Hegarty, ‘Great writing and storytelling also has to understand the principle of input
and out-take. For example, if I want to make you think I’m funny, I don’t tell you I’m really
funny, I tell you a joke. You laugh and think, “Wow, that guy is really funny.’” He also
explains that communicators should inspire people to do something, rather than merely give
them instructions, and should never forget ‘a brand is an agglomeration of stories linked
together by a vision’.Happy endings
Creating successful communication messages is a challenge for marketing managers, and
identifying opportunities to stimulate meaningful conversations or create a story that
captures the hearts and minds of the target audience is difficult. Furthermore, the attitude of
the recipient will be influenced by whether they are favourably disposed towards advertising
in general, as this will affect the effectiveness of the communication message. Despite
these challenges, manufactures of generic products like butter, milk, tea and toilet paper
have frequently been successful in ticking all the boxes and creating messages with the
best happy endings in the communication industry, by developing stories involving animals
and children.
In 1972, the likeable Labrador puppy first appeared in Andrex toilet roll commercials and
proved so successful it has since appeared in more than 130 campaigns. Puppies feature
on Andrex products and its website, and over the years the slogans have evolved from ‘soft,
strong and very long’ through ‘tuggable, huggable softness’ to ‘be kind to your behind’. The
loveable puppies continue to make the brand memorable, and have been so enduring they
have become a metaphor for the brand, delivering happy endings all round for Andrex and
its customers (Jefferson 2022). More recently, Budweiser is another brand to have used
‘puppy love’ to produce highly emotional adverts with happy endings.
There are many other examples of products that have successfully used animals in their
campaign stories: Kerrygold butter with its cows; PG Tips tea and its chimpanzees; Cesar
dog food with a West Highland white terrier; and the Felix cat food brand, which uses the
iconic black and white cartoon cat. From shoes to car commercials, animals score highly on
the likeability scale, and are usually a safe bet for delivering a happy ending that captures
the imagination of the target audience and delivers a good return on investment for the
brand.
But not all happy endings are born out of cuteness and likeability. Social media and video
on demand have opened new routes to follow Hegarty’s principles. LEGO’s
#RebuildTheWorld arguably applied these general principles to capture attention and drive
engagement during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the world was experiencing much
uncertainty. Peloton’s (exercise bike) campaign, #TogetherWeGoFar, aimed to support the
community and encourage fitness. This strapline has become one of the brand’s core
values, driving product development, customer and community engagement, and telling a
much bigger story of value creation and social impact.

The increasing complexity of communications channels, the shift towards
informal away from formal lines of communications, and the growing
importance of digital and mobile channels and media are blurring the divisions
between communication tools, sales channels and the media. Research
(Doherty et al. 1999) into the use of digital technology in the retail sector
highlighted that, for this industry, the internet is a channel that facilitates
communications, interactions and sales. For example, technology and
electrical retailer Currys uses SMS to send text messages to its customers,
informing them of the latest offers, but also uses this channel to provide
product delivery information. Additionally, the firm’s brand websites are used
for sales, communications and after-sales care. For the customer, the message,
the media and the channel work together seamlessly, while for the firm the
main point is the basic premise of its messages has not changed, but the
opportunities to leverage advantage through greater functionality and extended
touchpoints of the message have increased significantly.
The tools
Promotional communication tools deliver the message to the target audiences.
We cover key characteristics and the impact on selection of tools to use for
IMC campaigns. How each communication tool can be used in integrated
campaigns is covered in detail in the following chapters.
Chapter 13 – mass communications tools, which reach wide audiences using
non-personal communication techniques, such as advertising, public
relations and sales promotions.
Chapter 14 – digital marketing and social media, tools that connect with
target audiences through digital and mobile channels, and foster engagement
through digital channels.
Chapter 15 – direct communications, tools that communicate with specific
members of the target audience, such as direct marketing and personal
selling.First, we briefly consider the division of tools into the following groups: mass,
direct and digital.
Mass, direct and digital communications
As explored earlier, messages can take many forms and be communicated to
various audiences. Because of the volume of marketing messages currently
aimed at consumers and businesses, there is a likelihood many of these
messages will not reach the target recipients in the way that might be intended.
This fact makes the study of marketing communications a fascinating aspect of
marketing. Currently, there are three major groups of tools available to the
marketer.
Mass marketing communications include advertising, sales promotions and
public relations. These are methods of communication that can be styled to
meet IMC campaign objectives. Mass communications methods are those that
primarily involve sending non-personal messages to wide target audiences.
The main media for mass communications are broadcast, print and digital
channels. Mass communications are sometimes criticized because their impact
is difficult to measure – particularly that of advertising and public relations –
therefore it can be difficult to value the return on investment.
Digital promotions and social media communications include websites,
email marketing, buzz marketing and social media. Digital communications
can also be styled to meet IMC campaign objectives, but can be difficult to
categorize as channels and function can overlap. For example, a firm’s website
can accommodate many aspects and elements – the BBC, say, uses its websites
as a communication channel, an information resource, a media player and a
sales channel. Digital communications can reach wide, narrow and individual
target audiences. These forms of communication are the most measurable;
sophisticated analytics and metrics programs provide a wealth of data, ranging
from what a website user downloads to the time of day a person opens and
reads their email messages. Digital marketing and social media are explored in
detail in Chapter 14.
Direct marketing communications include personal selling, exhibitions and
direct marketing (acquiring and retaining customers without the use of an
intermediary; direct marketing can also involve the distribution of products,
information and promotional benefits to target consumers through interactive
communication in a way that allows response to be measured). These are also
methods of communication that can be styled to meet IMC campaignpage 479
objectives, but the main difference is direct communications can be
personalized, highly specific and tend to be used to target narrow or niche
audiences. These tools rarely use broadcast or print media to deliver the
message. Direct communications are also easier to measure than mass
communications. The measurement aspect has been a key driver in the
increase in the use of these tools in recent years.
The rest of this section introduces the individual tools that make up the
promotional mix and considers their impact for IMC campaigns.
The challenge for marketing managers responsible for communications lies
in selecting the right mix of tools and then the media channels to deliver the
message. The promotional communications mix is a key element in any IMC
campaign. This is because the mix provides the means by which the message
achieves campaign objectives and determines the style used to craft the
message. There are six major components of the mix – advertising, personal
selling, direct marketing, digital promotion, sales promotion and public
relations.
1. Advertising: any paid form of non-personal communication of ideas or
products in the prime media (i.e. television, the press, outdoor, cinema, radio
and the internet).
2. Personal selling: oral communication with prospective purchasers, with the
intention of making a sale.
3. Direct marketing: the distribution of products, information and
promotional benefits to target consumers through interactive communication
in a way that allows response to be measured.
4. Digital promotion: the promotion of products and services to consumers
and businesses through digital media channels.
5. Sales promotion: incentives to consumers or the trade that are designed to
stimulate purchase.
6. Public relations (PR): educating and informing an organization’s public
through the media without paying for the time or space directly.
In addition, product placement, sponsorship, exhibitions and branding are also
used to communicate with target audiences. These tools are covered in
Chapters 13 and 15.To develop an IMC campaign, the marketing manager must make a choice
of the promotional blend needed to communicate to the target audience. Each
of the six major promotional tools has its own strengths and limitations, and
these are summarized in Table 12.2. Marketers will weigh these factors
carefully against communication objectives to decide the amount of resources
to channel into each tool.
TABLE 12.2 Key characteristics of the core tools of the promotional mix
Advertising
Good for awareness building, because it can reach a wide audience quickly
Repetition means a brand-positioning concept can be communicated effectively; television is
particularly strong, but the level of use is changing due to the internet
Can be used to aid the sales effort, to legitimize a firm and its products
Impersonal, lacks flexibility and questions cannot be answered
Limited capability to close the sale
Personal selling
Interactive: questions can be answered and objectives overcome
Adaptable: presentations can be changed depending on customer needs
Complex arguments can be developed
Relationships can be built, because of its personal nature
Provides the opportunity to close the sale
Sales calls are costly
Direct marketing
Individually targets those consumers most likely to respond to an appeal
Communication can be personalized
Short-term effectiveness can be measured easily
A continuous relationship can be built through periodic contact
Activities are less visible to competitors
Response rates are often low
Poorly targeted direct marketing activities cause consumer annoyance
Digital
Global reach to consumers and businesses at a comparatively low cost
Highly measurable
Interactive digital promotions enable a dialogue between firms and their customers and
suppliers
Highly adaptable, as messages, prices, products and content can be changed rapidlypage 480
Highly flexible; can be used to create sales and communication channels
Highly targeted and can be personalized
Convenient form of access to product and firm information and purchasing
Avoids the necessity of negotiating and arguing with salespeople
High cost of development of websites and mobile content
Poses security issues and risk of intrusion
Sales promotion
Incentives provide a quick boost to sales
Effects may be only short term
Excessive use of some incentives (e.g. money off) may damage brand image
Public relations
Highly credible, as message comes from a third party
Higher readership than advertisements in trade and technical publications
Loss of control: a press release may or may not be used, and its content may be distorted
Usually, five considerations will have a major impact on the choice of the
promotional mix.
1. Resource availability and the cost of promotional tools to conduct a national
advertising campaign may require millions of pounds. If resources are not
available, cheaper tools such as sales promotion or public relations may
have to be used.
2. Market size and concentration – if a market is small and concentrated, then
personal selling may be feasible, but for mass markets that are
geographically dispersed, selling to the ultimate customer would not be
cost-effective. In such circumstances, advertising, digital promotion or
direct marketing may be the correct choice.
3. Customer information needs – if a complex technical argument is required,
personal selling may be preferred. If all that is required is the appropriate
brand image, then advertising may be more sensible.
4. Product characteristics – because of the above arguments, business-to￾business firms tend to spend more on personal selling than on advertising,
whereas consumer goods firms tend to do the reverse.page 481
5. Push versus pull strategies – a push strategy involves an attempt to sell into
channel intermediaries (e.g. retailers) and is dependent on personal selling
and trade promotions. A pull strategy bypasses intermediaries to
communicate to consumers directly. The resultant consumer demand
persuades intermediaries to stock the product. Advertising and consumer
promotions are more likely to be used.
Two points need to be stressed. First, marketing communications are not
the exclusive province of the promotional mix. All elements of the marketing
mix communicate to target customers. The product itself communicates
quality; price may be used by consumers as an indicator of quality, and the
choice of distribution channel will affect customer exposure to the product.
Second, effective communication is not a one-way producer-to-consumer flow.
Producers need to understand the needs and motivations of their target
audience before they can talk to them in a meaningful way. For example,
marketing research may be used to understand large consumer segments before
designing an IMC campaign, and salespeople may ask questions of buyers to
reveal their circumstances, problems and needs before making a sales
presentation. Furthermore, using the internet and the web,
members of the target audience can freely express their views and
opinions through customer feedback, reviews, blogs and social media.
Developing a successful IMC campaign involves careful planning and
implementation, topics discussed in more detail later in the chapter. However,
at the start of a campaign, firms should ensure they have completed a situation
analysis and have identified communication opportunities before selecting the
communication mix. Furthermore, communication mix decisions should not be
taken in isolation. Marketers need to consider the complete communication
package by selecting tools that create a suitable blend with other components
of the promotional campaign mix. The aim is to ensure a clear and consistent
message is received by target audiences. The media channel that carries the
message is a further consideration. In the past, media decisions were
associated mainly with advertising, but now other tools can be involved in
media selection. For example, sales promotions can appear on broadcast
media, outdoor media, in-store or be delivered via email. Direct marketing
uses the internet, mail services and mobile, and even personal selling is now
possible via the web. Public relations messages can also involve similar media
selection, as they can be sent via the internet and through mobile messaging.Media channels
Media channels are chosen to carry the message, using the selected
communication tool, to the target audience. However, media costs have risen,
brands have become more targeted and the choice of media channels has
increased. Table 12.3 lists the different media channels available to marketing
communication managers.
TABLE 12.3 Media channels
Media channel Type
Broadcast Television, radio
Print Newspapers, magazines, fanzines
Digital Websites, intranets, portals, email, interactive TV, mobile, social networks
Social Online communities, blogs
Outdoor Billboards, street furniture, transport, guerrilla, digital display
Indoor Point of sale, in-store posters, window and shelf displays, ambient
Cinema Multiplex, IMAX, outdoor
Arguably, before the internet was available commercially (pre-1989),
media decisions were clear-cut. They involved deciding which media class
(e.g. broadcast or print) and which media vehicle (e.g. which specific
newspaper) would carry the message. Print was the most widely used,
followed by television. However, since the commercialization of the internet,
the whole media world has changed. Digital channels now account for more of
the communication budget spend than any other media (e.g. television,
newspapers, radio, outdoor). The reason for digital’s increasing popularity is
bound up in its flexibility. Digital channels (the web and associated
technology) can act not only as a multimedia channel, offering marketing
communication managers the opportunity to send video, audio and text-based
messages, but also create an environment for advertising, sales promotions,
direct marketing, personal selling and public relations. Consequently, digital
technologies now accommodate almost every aspect of the communication and
media mix. The technology also adds innovative ways to communicatepage 482
messages to a target audience, for example animation, interaction, social
communities and crowdsourcing (discussed further in Chapter 16).
Currently, organizations use various media channels to carry their message.
Probably the key media decision is which forms of media channel to use (e.g.
broadcast, print, digital).
Media channel choice
When considering media channels, the media planner faces the choice of using
television, press, cinema, outdoor, radio, digital platforms and digital channels,
or some combination of media classes. Various aspects will be considered, and
creative factors may have a major bearing on the decision, for example the
type of message and the audio/visual elements that make up the appeal.
Turkish Airlines used animation, humour and characters from The Lego Movie
to make an in-flight video to communicate all the safety features of its airlines.
The film is shown on all the airline’s flights and, additionally, has been viewed
nearly 20 million times on YouTube (Gibson 2018). The safety video was so
successful Turkish Airlines released a sequel based on The Lego Movie 2
(Schlappig 2019). The key question to be addressed is ‘Does the medium allow
the communication objectives to be realized?’ For example, if the objective is
to position the brand as having a high-status aspirational personality, television
is better than posters. However, if the communication objective is to remind
the target audience of a brand’s existence, a poster campaign may suffice. Each
medium possesses its own set of creative qualities and limitations, as described
below.
The creative opportunities afforded by the media channel can add to the
richness of the message. Other considerations when selecting media are the
media type (e.g. newspaper, website, poster, mobile), the media vehicle
decision (e.g. a particular newspaper – The Times, Le Monde) and media
planning (e.g. media buying, scheduling, timing, frequency). These issues are
covered in detail in Chapter 13.
Broadcast For example, a lawnmower can be shown to cut grass
efficiently, or the ease of application of a paint can be demonstrated. The
capability of television (unlike press, posters and radio) to combine colour,
movement and sound means it is often used when building brand image andintroducing new products. It is easier to create an atmosphere using television
than other media that lack its versatility. Traditionally, viewers could not refer
to the advertisement once it had been broadcast (unlike the press); however,
with the advent of YouTube and other online video platforms, adverts can be
viewed repeatedly. Indeed, adverts are often launched through YouTube and
social media.
John Lewis’s highly successful Christmas adverts were shown first online,
to great success, and now leading supermarkets vie for position in releasing the
most viewed Christmas adverts, measured by digital engagement analytics.
Despite the increase in popularity of television commercials online, a
potential threat to mainstream television advertising is digital recording
devices (e.g. digiboxes like those of Sky and Freesat), which can store more
than 100 hours of programmes, allowing viewers to record their choice of
programmes, watch them when convenient and skip through the adverts,
potentially reducing television advertising effectiveness. Also, the rise of
media service providers like Netflix and Amazon Prime is disrupting the
industry, as they use a subscription model rather than advertising revenue to
fund their operation. Amazon has introduced Freevee an advert-supported
video-on-demand service. Viewers can watch without paying a subscription,
but in return they must watch the adverts, which cannot be skipped.
Digital television technology means data signals can be compressed,
allowing more to be sent to the viewer. The result is the escalation of the
number of channels that can be received. The extra ‘bandwidth’ created by
digital technology is likely to reduce costs, enabling small players to broadcast
to small target audiences such as small geographical areas and special-interest
groups (e.g. shoppers).
Television programmes can now be watched via computer and smartphone,
with the development of such online services as BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub.
Following the success of YouTube, firms have found setting up their own￾brand television channel is proving very successful for fostering consumer
engagement. Many firms have taken advantage of this opportunity to
communicate with their target audiences, for example Apple, Coca-Cola, and
fashion retailers H&M and New Look. Audi has found potential car buyers
return 12 times during the decision-making process, and its channel features
several streams of video-on-demand content: sport, lifestyle, behind the
scenes, on the road, adventure, people, culture and places. (Press and media
vehicles are discussed in more detail in Chapter 13, in the section on
advertising.)page 483
Broadcast radio is creatively limited to sound, and thus may be better
suited to communicating factual information (e.g. a special price reduction)
than attempting to create a brand image. The nature of the audience changes
during the day (e.g. motorists during rush hour), and so a measure of targeting
is possible. Production costs are relatively low. The arrival of digital radio
increased the number of radio stations available and marginally improved
sound quality. Digital radios have displays that allow website details and
telephone numbers to be run at the same time as an advertisement is being
played (Hicks 2005). Radio listening has also increased through voice￾activated devices such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home.
Print Print permits factual information to be presented in a press
advertisement (e.g. specific features of a washing machine, car or computer),
and readers are in control of how long they take to absorb the information.
Allied to this advantage is the possibility of re-examination of the
advertisement at a later date. However, print media lack movement and sound,
and advertisements in newspapers and magazines compete with editorial for
the reader’s attention. The boundaries are blurring, though, and the
introduction of the iPad and other tablet computers is enabling print
publications to be delivered digitally, which means they are able to carry
multimedia content. (Press and media vehicles are discussed in more detail in
Chapter 13, in the section on advertising.)
Digital This medium allows global reach at relatively low cost. The number
of website visits, clicks on advertisements and products purchased can be
measured. Interactivity between supplier and consumer is possible, either by
website-based communication or email. Direct sales are possible, which is
driving the growth of e-business in such areas as hotels, travel and information
technology. Advertising content can be changed quickly and easily. Catalogues
and price lists can be amended rapidly, and a dialogue between firms and their
customers and suppliers can be established. Placing sponsored links to
websites on search engines can give firms almost instant advertising; Google is
the market leader for ‘paid search’ or ‘pay-per-click’ advertising. The basic
idea is advertisers bid in an online auction for the right to have their link
displayed next to the results for specific search terms, such as ‘used cars’ or
‘mobile phones’, and then pay only when a visitor to the site actually clicks onthat link (hence ‘pay-per-click’). An advantage to the advertiser is the
consumer has already expressed interest and intent – first by typing in the
search term and then by clicking on the advertiser’s link – and therefore is
more likely to make a purchase than someone passively watching an
advertisement on television or looking at one in a newspaper. Digital
advertising is on the increase and now accounts for more of the media spend
than any other form of media-based advertising. (Digital marketing, social
media and the internet are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 14.)
Social With social media, messages can be straightforward and direct, but
the way in which messages are transmitted through social media communities
can be highly complex and multilayered. To make creative use of social media,
it is important to understand the concept of social capital and how power is
attached to particular members of the online community (Coleman 1988).
Such communities provide an area for digital conversations, where members
of the community can feel a sense of belonging (Tuten and Solomon 2013).
For example, Facebook enables its billions of users to start conversations with
their friends, and share thoughts, pictures and conversations with like-minded
people around most parts of the globe.
This type of medium can act as a conduit to access homogeneous groups of
individuals, but commercial organizations that use this type of space to carry
their messages should be aware that social media can be many things to many
people – from a community, to a publishing space, to entertainment and a
social commerce arena – and, consequently, great care needs to be taken to
ensure the content and tone of the message are in keeping with the
expectations of the chosen target community (Tuten and Solomon 2013). For
example, Mumsnet.com is an online community for parents seeking help and
advice on bringing up children. Many issues have been debated within this
community, from the sexualization of children to the increased occurrence of
childhood diabetes. (Social media are discussed in greater detail in Chapter
14.)
Outdoor Simplicity is required in the creative work associated with
outdoor advertising because many people (e.g. car drivers) will have the
opportunity only to glance at a poster. Like the press, outdoor advertising is
largely visual and is often used as a support medium alongside television,
internet or press campaigns, because of its creative limitations. Outdoor
advertising is, however, an effective medium for carrying messages thatpage 484
remind target audiences of issues and products. Poster campaigns can be
created with a limited promotions budget but can be used to good effect.
Possibly the most effective use of outdoor advertising was by Benetton’s
creative director, Oliviero Toscani. With a series of highly controversial poster
campaigns, Toscani led the brand from being a medium-sized European brand
to a global one. In 2011, to gain attention for its ‘Unhate’ campaign – which
aimed to break down cultural barriers – a series of thought-provoking images
carrying the Benetton logo appeared on billboards around the world.
Often, outdoor advertising sites are sold as a package targeting specific
audiences. This form of advertising can also be low-key. Exhibit 12.3 shows
how Costa Coffee uses an A-frame board to promote the quality of its coffee.

Technology is helping outdoor advertising to gain a bigger share of
advertising in the prime media. Digital advertising boards now bring more
flexibility and high-quality imagery to this form of media. Backlit and
scrolling sites are gradually replacing more traditional glued posters. Digital
technology is allowing animated posters, the content of which alters during the
day, and high-definition-quality moving images.
As mentioned above, for outdoor advertising the keyword is simplicity. An
ad has, on average, just six seconds to get a message across, which has led tothe golden rule no more than seven words on a poster. London’s Piccadilly
Circus is a high-profile location for outdoor messages, as millions of
pedestrians and drivers pass by every week. The Piccadilly Lights complex
carries static and animated adverts, and messages can be changed according to
the time of day.
Guerrilla is a potentially controversial tactic used in outdoor media. The
aim is often to deliver communication messages through unexpected means
and in ways that almost ‘ambush’ the consumer to gain their attention (Fahy
and Jobber 2015). One of the most effective guerrilla marketing campaigns
was that used by Carlsberg in the UK, which also employed its well-known
positioning slogan, ‘Carlsberg don’t do […] but if they did it would probably
be the best […] in the world.’ The firm dropped £50,000 worth of £5 and £10
notes all over London on which were stickers containing the slogan ‘Carlsberg
don’t do litter, but if they did, it would probably be the best litter in the world.’
For a small investment, the brand received enormous publicity. Another
example is when DSL55 launched its first London store aimed at young
skateboarders. It employed people to place stickers showing the firm’s winged
angel at locations where the target audience might be, for example close to
skateboard parks, on street furniture and lamp posts. To use this form of
medium, communicators must be prepared to connect with their target
audience in a very unusual, unconventional, surprising – and often illegal –
manner. This is not a mainstream medium, and it is often used when the
communication budget is small.
Indoor Indoor media include in-store point-of-purchase materials,
packaging, window display signs and the on-shelf display. These forms of
media are used predominantly by retailers and consumer-facing service
providers, but may also be used at transit stations, within shopping centres, and
at entertainment and sports arenas. These types of media are increasingly using
digital technology to deliver highly creative messages.
Ambient Both outdoor and indoor media can apply techniques called
ambient media. These non-traditional forms of media are often used to take the
target audience by surprise. Ambient advertising generally refers to the
established outdoor categories such as billboards, bus signs, or point-of-sale or
in-store posters found at checkouts. Advertising that appears on shopping bags,
petrol pump nozzles, balloons or banners towed by aeroplanes, on street
pavements, overhead lockers on aircraft, and so on, are also classed as
ambient. Ambient media are limited only by the advertiser’s imagination.page 485
Cinema Cinema advertisements can benefit from colour, movement and
sound, and exposure is high due to the captive nature of the audience.
However, repetition may be difficult to achieve, given that people visit
cinemas intermittently. In the past, cinemagoers tended to be between 15 and
25 years of age. Brands like BMW Mini, Volkswagen, Toyota, Citroën and
Ford have used the cinema to target young audiences (Donnelly 2008).
However, the demographic of cinemagoers has changed as cinema has become
more family orientated. Family films such as The Lego Movie, Muppets Most
Wanted and Paddington sometimes see the power of characters transcend into
wider society (Exhibit 12.4) and continue to attract the younger audience, and
this has led firms to invest in longer adverts for delivery through cinemas (e.g.
Disney purchased 60-second slots before family feature films). Older
audiences are attracted by comedy dramas, such as The Best Exotic
Marigold Hotel series, and Marks & Spencer has been attracted by
this target market, offering its first movie-related promotion, a ‘buy one, get
one free’ film ticket deal on Mother’s Day (Durrani 2015).

The people
Managing communications involves complex decision-making. There are also
many challenges involved in bringing together teams and departments in an
integrated manner to satisfy the marketing objectives of the advertising agency
while engaging the attention of target audiences. Research proposes a two￾stage approach: the first stage is the client/agency level; the second stage istarget audience level (Mishra and Muralie 2010). Consequently, there are three
types of people to consider: the customer, the client and the agency.
Customers vary from single individuals, to families and groups, to business
customers and global corporations. Consequently, their motivations, interests,
spending power and needs vary considerably. Nevertheless, it is becoming
increasingly important to ensure any firm (the client) wishing to communicate
does so by understanding the needs of its customers and how they engage with
communications.
Clients come in many different shapes and sizes – from large corporate
clients with multimillion-dollar communication budgets to spend in promoting
a wide portfolio of products and building brands (e.g. Unilever, Kraft Foods,
GE, Mercedes) to small independent firms planning their first website.
Agencies develop communications, which vary considerably in terms of
what they have to offer. Agencies generally provide account management and
liaison with the client, the creative teams and production of the communication
campaigns. They also plan the media and can be responsible for research.
Types of agencies include: full service, creative boutiques, specialized
agencies, digital agencies and web service providers.
The client is generally the originator of communication initiatives, and is
also likely to make key decisions and ultimately be responsible for the
planning approach: target market selection (the customer), financial resources
and agency selection. Corporate marketing is where decisions are made about
a firm’s image and corporate identity. Again, the client (the firm) will strongly
influence communication decisions. Selection of the marketing communication
mix and media coordination is where the agency can become much more
influential in the decision-making process; the agency is likely to be
responsible for the management of these elements of IMC. Ensuring the
consistency of the message is the responsibility of both client and agency, and
they need to ensure that, whatever form the IMC campaign takes, it delivers a
consistent message throughout to the target audiences (the customer).
Office politics can occur, especially in the form of clashes between
advertising creatives who, say, have radical ideas to take a brand forward with
the latest of a series of television commercials, and brand executives with very
conservative values who want to protect a brand’s traditional target markets.
Difficult situations can arise when IMC strategies call for a shift in expenditure
from advertising to direct or digital promotion. Other problems surround the
specialist nature of different communication disciplines, which can narrow
people’s minds to such an extent they fail to understand how some marketingobjectives can be better achieved by using a different communications
technique (Murgatroyd 2004).
However, for a campaign to be successful, issues and problems must be
overcome, and this is often achieved by appointing a senior-level
communications officer to oversee all of the firm’s communications activities.
A director of marketing communications is likely to be responsible for
deciding the extent to which each of the components of the promotional mix is
used to achieve business and marketing objectives.

The contexts
In this chapter, we have explored the changing nature of the communication
environment, looked at the drivers for the adoption of an IMC approach,
considered the processes associated with developing a campaign, and
examined important elements that form the core constituents of an IMC
campaign. In this final section, we look at the different contexts for IMCpage 486
campaigns, namely, business-to-consumer and business-to-business settings,
and corporate profiles.
Three main contexts define the target audience and nature of IMC
campaigns. These contexts determine the focus, strategy and the actions a
campaign aims to achieve.
Pull-positioning strategies aim to encourage consumers and end-user
business customers to make a purchase, thereby pulling goods through the
supply chain from the manufacturer to the retailer (or final purchase point in
the supply chain) (see Figure 12.5).
FIGURE 12.5
Direction of communication flow in pull-positioning strategies
Based on: Fill (2011, pp.99–102)
In a pull-positioning strategy, messages tend to be designed to create
awareness and stimulate action among members of the target audience. The
underlying idea is that target audiences expect the product to be availablepage 487
when they wish to make a purchase. Many consumer brands use pre￾announcements and give launch dates to stimulate interest and excitement. For
example, Apple gives launch dates for its new products and latest versions of
existing products. This raises anticipation, causes excitement and creates pre￾sale demand. High-tech shoppers and Apple aficionados form queues at Apple
Stores and stockists on the launch date, hoping to be able to purchase the latest
iPhone or iPad. The pull strategy also enables Apple to encourage its stockists
(e.g. Currys, KRCS, Elgiganten, Electro World) to have stock available in￾store to meet consumer demand.
Push-positioning strategies aim to move goods through the supply chain.
The target audiences for this type of communications initiatives are channel
intermediaries. Often, communication objectives aim to build relationships
between channel intermediaries, and influence trade partners to take stock,
allocate shelf space and help to develop trade partners’ awareness of product
features and benefits (Fill 2011). Push communications also tend to take place
in a channel network moving goods from one point to another (see Figure
12.6).
FIGURE 12.6
Direction of communication flow in push-positioning strategiespage 488
This strategy is widely used between businesses, and the most prevalent
communication tools are personal selling and trade promotions (see Chapter 13
for further details). For example, Costco is a large intermediary in the retail
supply chain. It supplies both trade and retail customers with top fast-moving
consumer goods brands (e.g. Heinz, Coca-Cola, Gillette, Colgate), white goods
(e.g. Beko, Bosch), small electricals (e.g. Breville), electric kettles and fresh
foods from various producers. Each supplier engages in push communications
designed to ensure Costco continues to stock its ranges. Manufacturers also
work together with Costco to increase purchases, using a range of techniques
from tastings to bonus packs.
Profile-positioning strategies aim to develop the image and identity of an
organization. In addition to consumer and business target audiences, there are
many other stakeholders that might be interested in an organization, for
example investors, the local community, the media, trade unions, pressure
groups and employees. The perceptions and views of such stakeholders are
increasingly important, and this has given rise to greater use of IMC
campaigns to raise corporate reputations. Public relations, sponsorship,
lobbying, media relations and internal communications are examples of the
methods used in this instance to develop a corporate profile.
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapter Detailed review
1. The elements of integrated marketing communication (IMC) campaigns
The elements include the message, the tools, the media channel and the context
applied in a coordinated campaign designed to create multiple opportunities to
engage with the target audience.
2. The value of IMC campaigns
IMC is the concept by which firms coordinate their marketing communications
tools to deliver a clear, consistent, credible and competitive message about the
organization and its products.
The IMC philosophy has led to the rise in media-neutral planning, which is the
process of solving communications problems through an unbiased evaluation of all
media.
3. How IMC campaigns are organized
Planning campaigns develop from a situation analysis, which should aid a firm in
identifying communication opportunities. Following on from this is agency
selection, the briefing process and setting out the deliverables an agency will
produce. The next stage in the process is the development of the campaign and its
implementation. The penultimate stage is evaluation of the effectiveness of all
elements of the campaign. The final stage is future planning.
4. Elements of IMCpage 489
The core elements are: the messages used to position a product, brand and/or an
organization in the minds of the customer; the tools – the six key methods of
achieving communication objectives; the media, which are the channels that carry
the message to the audience; the people who collectively are responsible for
creating, planning, managing and implementing the communication campaign; and
the context – the setting in which communication takes place.
5. The message
At the heart of communications is the message. Messages are very
important as they not only transfer information from message sender to recipient,
but can also determine the nature of a relationship, establish credibility, set the
tone for a conversation, and cross tangible and intangible boundaries. Effective
messages can become so powerful they can be heard around the globe, when
used with suitable media channels.
6. The communication process
The communication process begins with the source encoding a message that is
transmitted through media to the receiver, who decodes it. Noise (e.g. distractions)
may prevent the message reaching the receiver. Feedback may be direct when
talking to a salesperson or through marketing research. The simple model explains
the basic elements of the communication process, whereas the complex model
explains how communication messages pass by formal and informal messages
between message senders and different types of message recipient.
7. The factors affecting choice of promotional mix for IMC campaigns
The factors are resource availability and the cost of promotional tools, market size
and concentration, customer information needs, product characteristics, and push
versus pull strategies.
8. The key characteristics of the major promotional tools
Advertising: strong for awareness building, brand positioning, firm and brand
legitimization, but it is impersonal and inflexible and has only a limited ability to
close a sale.
Personal selling: strong for interactivity, adaptability, the delivery of complex
arguments, relationship building and the closing of the sale, but is costly.
Direct marketing: strong for individual targeting, personalization, measurement,
relationship building through periodic contact, low visibility to competitors, but
response rates are often low and direct marketing can cause annoyance.
Digital marketing: strong for global reach, measurement, establishing a dialogue,
quick changes to catalogues and prices, convenience and avoiding arguments
with salespeople, but impersonal and requires consumers to visit website.
Sales promotion: strong on providing immediate incentive to buy, but effects may
be short term and can damage brand image.
Public relations: strong on credibility and high readership, but loss of control.
9. The media channels
When considering which media channel to use, the media planner faces the
choice of using television, the press, cinema, outdoor, radio, the internet or some
combination of media classes. There are various factors to consider; creativepage 490
factors may have a major bearing on the decision. The key question that needs to
be addressed is ‘Does the medium allow the communication objectives to be
realized?’
10. The people
Managing communications involves complex decision-making. There are also
many challenges involved in bringing together teams and departments in an
integrated manner to satisfy the marketing objectives while engaging the attention
of target audiences.
Research proposes a two-stage approach: the first stage is the client/agency level;
the second stage is target audience level. Consequently, there are three types of
people to consider: the customer, the client and the agency.
11. The context
Three main contexts define the target audience and nature of IMC campaigns.
These contexts determine the focus, strategy and actions a campaign aims to
achieve.

CASE 23DOMINO’S: REACHING
AND STAYING NUMBER
ONE
Introduction
Domino’s Pizza, Inc., now branded simply as Domino’s, is an American quick service restaurant
(QSR) chain founded in 1960. Through a then little-known format, now called franchising,
Domino’s enabled other people to invest in opening their own store. Domino’s came to the UK
in 1985, where it now has more than 1,200 stores, the biggest Domino’s market in Europe.
In the mid-2000s, Domino’s was a faltering competitor in a global chain pizza landscape
dominated by Pizza Hut. Customers complained about Domino’s product quality, sales were
falling and the chain’s stock price hovered at an all-time low of $3. When Patrick Doyle came on
board as CEO of Domino’s Pizza in 2010, he vowed to transform the struggling pizza company
into a ‘technology-enabled, nimble, category-disrupting machine’. The radical action Domino’s
then took included publicly admitting that its pizzas were bad, in the unusually frank ‘Oh yes we
did’ campaign, with executives reading brutal customer comments on camera (Campaign
2017). By 2018, it offered 18 different ways to order, and 65 per cent of all orders came through
digital channels. Domino’s turnaround had achieved spectacularly successful results, with the
company being declared the ‘largest pizza company in the world’, having generated $12.3
billion in global revenue and the share price reaching a high of over $300 (Rogers 2018).
But, by 2019, the on-demand economy sparked by Uber, Netflix and Amazon Prime had spread
to the restaurant industry, and Domino’s appeared to falter in the face of aggressive third-party
delivery competition from aggregators including Deliveroo, Just Eat, Uber Eats, Grubhub,
Seamless, DoorDash and Ritual. ‘Deliveroo has replaced the high street,’ lamented one of the
many restaurant owners, who were obliged to pay between 15 and 35 per cent of the total cost
of the order in commission to delivery apps.
Then, in 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic quickly spread worldwide, with social distancing and
lockdowns hitting the restaurant industry hard. Takeout and delivery became the new go-to
options for many consumers, both by necessity (‘stay at home’ orders) and because the great
majority of restaurants were jumping on the food delivery service bandwagon, with pizza of
course being one of the most popular foods.
Domino’s cutting-edge technology, data-driven decision-making and strict policy of only using
its own in-house delivery services enabled it to push back and keep growing during the
pandemic.
Digital Transformation
Domino’s transformation from failing disappointment to market leader stems directly from its
vigorous and consistent efforts to perfect digital marketing practices. It built an impressive, and
immersive, digital experience that rivals many traditional e-commerce brands. David Wild,page 494
former DPG CEO, explains: ‘In 1999, UK online sales were £100K per annum, in 2003 online
sales of £100K were achieved in a week, in 2018 sales worth £100K are being taken in four
minutes’ (Wild 2018).
Early adoption of mobile apps and channels provided by far the largest lift to Domino’s direct
product sales. The iOS app became popular for its customization features, which included
graphical abilities to design a unique pizza and save individual orders. By 2018, 80 per cent of
DPG’s sales were via digital ordering channels, and more than half of all sales were placed on
mobile devices.
Domino’s adoption of digital marketing began with its use of social media to find fresh ideas for
improving its business. In 2012, Domino’s launched its ‘Think Oven’, a Facebook page where
participants were encouraged to submit ideas in two categories: the ‘Idea Box’ (for general
ideas, such as new menu items and tips for going green) and ‘Current Project’ (for specific
things Domino’s needs help with, such as new Domino’s uniforms). The ideas that attracted
most attention were rewarded with a monetary prize and actually implemented with executive
approval.
Following the success of social media initiatives, Domino’s began a radical overhaul of the
company’s entire ethos, with a focus on creating an ‘e-commerce company that happens to sell
pizza’. To accomplish this, Domino’s entire corporate structure was revised – beginning from
the top down – to focus on digital sales and advertising.

Digital Focus
In an interview (Wong 2018), Domino’s chief technology officer, Kelly Garcia, explained the
steps to modernizing the company. After focusing on talent acquisition, the biggest drive was to
create new opportunities for online customers. Domino’s was keen to insist that ordering be
possible on every popular internet platform, on any of its customers’ favourite devices, in any
way they want, anywhere, which is an ongoing effort facilitated by its AnyWare platform (Barrett
2016).page 495
Today, the ways customers can digitally place a Domino’s order include text, SMS, GIF, Twitter
tweet or emoji, Facebook Messenger, Slack, Google Home, Amazon Echo, Samsung and Apple
Smart TVs, Ford Synch, Apple or Android Watch, and of course Domino’s Dom app.
Dominic Paul, chief executive officer of Domino’s Pizza Group plc (DPG, the franchise that
operates the UK and Ireland operations) describes the Domino’s app as the ‘driving force’ of its
digital offer, accounting for 43.3 per cent of all DPG online sales. The app had 4.3 million
downloads in 2020, helping to win five million new customers: sales grew by more than 26 per
cent.
The app is continually improved to make ordering pizza even easier. As nations reunited in the
summer of 2021, an app update introduced personalized welcomes, advance ordering, group
ordering, in-car collection, and an option to save a customized pizza and give it a name.
Domino’s cutting-edge technology is created and built largely by teams at its World Resource
Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan, US, where it attracts top digital and marketing talent to
‘supercharge the iconic dough to door experience’. In late 2019, these cross-functional teams
were given a new space called Domino’s Innovation Garage, where they could ‘accelerate
Domino’s spirit of creativity and collaboration’, according to Kelly Garcia.
Domino’s led the way in enabling customers to order using voice commands and artificial
intelligence (AI) – it is becoming impossible to distinguish between a human and an AI bot. The
Dom chatbot responds to frequently asked enquiries and simplifies the process by
remembering clients’ prior orders. Dom also uses data integration to calculate delivery times
accurately, keeping track of each pizza’s progress throughout preparation and, once it is sent
out for delivery, giving customers real-time updates about when their order will arrive or be
ready for collection.
Other leading innovations include Domino’s Hotspots, which enable pizza ordering for delivery
to parks, beaches and other destinations that do not have traditional addresses, and a
sophisticated GPS driver tracker system, which was announced in 2019 and quickly expanded
system-wide.
Covid-19 brought forward the ‘Age of Delivery’ for the QSR industry and accelerated Domino’s
plans for digital transformation. Worldwide, more than 78 per cent of Domino’s sales are
ordered digitally, up from 70 per cent before the pandemic. And, in the UK, online sales for
2020 surged a whopping 23.9 per cent, accounting for 94.3 per cent of all sales.
Forward Thinking, Creativity and Innovation
While digital marketing remained the heart of Domino’s transformation, other areas of
development focused squarely on innovation, raising the brand image, building public trust and
pushing investors to take the plunge. The company gained wide media recognition for
experiments with autonomous vehicles, drones, AI and mobile marketing stunts.
A seamless delivery or collection experience is core to the business’s success, so Domino’s
invests heavily in improving every aspect of fulfilment. In 2012, it began its ‘fortressing’ strategy,
to add more stores to existing markets in an effort to cut down on delivery times and be closer
to carryout customers, as well as to prevent competition from gaining traction in the market.By only using its own delivery infrastructure and never those of third parties like Deliveroo,
Domino’s owns the customer experience and avoids losing a large cut of its income. ‘We
struggle a little bit understanding the long-term economics in some of the aggregator
businesses,’ commented Domino’s former chief financial officer Stu Levy. ‘We make money on
the product, but we don’t make money on the delivery’ (PYMNTS 2021).
To save delivery costs, Domino’s is also focused on increasing the number of carryout orders.
‘While the ticket is lower on a carryout order … there’s so much less labour cost associated
with [them],’ explained Richard Allison, Domino’s former CEO. And while the drive-through
collection model is important, it is not always feasible, so curb-side pick up is another key
development area: in-car collection is being transformed by cloud-based arrival prediction
technology that plugs into the mobile app, telling the restaurant when customers are
approaching and when they are outside for pick up, without the need for them to check in. ‘Our
aspiration here, which is well within reach, is that we get to a point where you can get curb-side
delivery at Domino’s faster than you can wait in line at a QSR drive-through.’
Customer Insight
Domino’s created a data and insights team in March 2020 to better understand customers’
changing demands during the pandemic, and in January 2021 merged its digital team under the
marketing remit. With more than 27 million (Motley Fool 2021) active members, Domino’s has
one of the largest loyalty programme memberships in retail, which provides a treasure chest of
data it can use for precision marketing.
Data privacy is also a vital consideration in Domino’s not using third-party aggregators like Uber
Eats or DoorDash: ‘It just doesn’t make sense for us or our franchisees economically, and it
certainly doesn’t make sense to take the risk of sharing all of our customer data with these third
parties,’ said Allison.
‘The company considers pricing, value and loyalty strategies by whether or not they will drive
traffic, and that approach is clearly paying off. Domino’s is able to do this because it leverages
its technology infrastructure to make data-driven decisions,’ said Allison. ‘I don’t have to make
gut calls because we’re listening to the customer and collecting that data to make the
decisions,’ he said. ‘We don’t tell [our franchisees] “we think you should do this.” We bring the

Domino’s relies heavily on digital marketing activities, including search engine marketing and
social media marketing. Search engine optimization (SEO) is crucial to getting ranked high in
search results on Google, and thereby lots of website traffic.
Paid Google, Facebook and Instagram advertisements produce great results, by helping
Domino’s target the right audience, and lowering cost per click by showing ads only to the
targeted audience.
Domino’s social media strategy is to connect with its followers and make things relatable by
using ordinary people in marketing campaigns, or by using hashtags and slogans that are
intended to create an emotional connection with its audience.
Email and SMS marketing are reserved mainly for order confirmation messages and
occasionally for remarketing. SMS is commonly used for sending one-time passwords (OTPs),
confirmations of orders, and offers.page 496
Traditional marketing, such as advertising on hoardings and banners, has also played an
important role in driving customers into stores, and promoting different offers in nearby stores.
Three Key Ingredients of Domino’s Digital
Transformation
Kelly Garcia sets out the three key ingredients of Domino’s digital transformation (Wong 2018):
1. Organizational buy-in from the top down: Because it would require a massive technology
investment to deliver a world-class e-commerce experience, it was crucial that everyone at
the top, from the board of directors to the CEO and down, needed to be on board. In 2012,
Garcia and Dennis Maloney, the chief digital officer, went to the board and outlined the
threats to the business. They introduced the idea that, to survive, they had to start thinking
of themselves as an ‘e-commerce company that happens to sell pizza’. The CEO already
believed in, and fully supported, this vision, and once the board was behind it as well, the
technology plan was funded. Along with gaining support from the top down, it was critical to
develop a strong culture at the company. Early on they were selling the vision as a means
of recruiting talent. As they began to see success, the culture became one of passion and
excitement, with very little staff turnover.
2. Relentless dedication to measuring results: With the help of an outstanding
analytics team, Domino’s was able to employ A/B testing (the testing of
different versions of advertising tools and messages to determine the most effective for a
given target group) against every new tool and process it implemented. Digital products,
especially those based on ordering, by nature provide massive amounts of data. By
understanding what was driving bottom-line results and sales, both across the board and by
franchise, Domino’s was able to offset costs and prove value. This, in turn, enabled the
company to attract more of the marketing budget to scale the areas that were working.
3. Marketing around telling customers about technology investment: With brand image being a
crucial area in need of improvement, Domino’s new unified, tech-forward vision was shared
broadly across owned, earned and paid channels. It was important for the brand to be
transparent about both its need to change as well as the huge investment it was making in
its digital transformation. In addition to investing heavily in telling consumers about its new
digital products, it built platforms like Think Oven to maintain a two-way dialogue with them.
According to Garcia, it was important from the start to promote a culture where the
marketing and IT teams were collaborative and strategically aligned.
What’s Next?
The transition to digital shows no sign of slowing. As of Q3 2020, Domino’s had more than
17,200 stores in over 90 markets. Domino’s more than tripled its digital capital expenditure in its
2022 financial year, from $6.8 million in the first half to $21 million, and outlined plans to
continue investing heavily over the next three years, as it looks to create ‘sustainable growth’
for the business. The expanded funding for digital initiatives came as the company announced
that its global sales grew 11 per cent to just over $2 billion. Of that, $1.6 billion were online
sales, up 11.5 per cent (Chirgwin 2022).
In the second quarter of 2021, Domino’s US had its 41st quarter of consecutive same store
sales growth and its same store sales were up 16 per cent over pre-pandemic 2019 levels.
Domino’s success leads to what its executives are calling a ‘virtuous cycle’. Volume growthpage 497
leads to higher sales and profitability, which leads to the ability to offer value at scale. As an
example, the company launched its $5.99 deal all the way back in 2009. That price point has
remained the same since, but store EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization) has more than doubled.
‘That’s because of scale. Value at scale lets us give our customers price points they’re going to
want,’ said Domino’s CEO, Russell J. Weiner. ‘We all have the same headwinds, but with the
scale that we have and the value we can offer, the headwinds in the industry are tailwinds for
Domino’s.’
Scale allows Domino’s to leverage purchasing power, technology investments, supply chain
economics and advertising costs.
Domino’s is projecting $25 billion in annual sales globally by 2025 – double its 2017 sales of
$12.25 billion – and plans to have more than 25,000 outlets on its system-wide network,
including 2,000 new US stores within that time frame.
Questions
1. Discuss how Domino’s has reinvented the brand using integrated marketing
communications.
2. Suggest how digital communications have enriched the communication process during the
transformation.
3. Debate the extent to which the on-demand economy is impacting Domino’s takeout and
delivery business, and how this may evolve.
4. Explain the characteristics of all the promotional tools used by Domino’s and then suggest
which are the most significant in driving the brand forward.
5. Imagine you own a regional chain of Chinese/Indian takeaway restaurants; explain what
you have learned from Domino’s transformation that could help you grow this business.

Retail Group), the UK industry association for e-retailing and e-commerce.

CASE 24
CRAFT BEERS:
MARKETING REBELS?
BrewDog is a brand built on attitude, and co-founder James Watt has a lot to say about the
value of advertising: ‘I would rather take my money and set fire to it … It’s the antithesis of
everything we stand for and everything we believe in. It’s a medium that is shallow, it’s fake and
we want nothing to do with it.’ His punk attitude suggests the firm’s values are anti-corporate,
anti-mainstream and anti-advertising, and when it comes to marketing, not having a budget is
not a problem (Warc 2019). This led BrewDog to find a new approach to communicate with its
consumers and the media.page 499
The Beginning
James Watt and Martin Dickie were school friends who grew up together in the fishing village of
Fraserburgh in the north-east of Scotland. They took different paths at the University of
Edinburgh: Dickie studied distilling after he found a passion for brewing as a 12 year old after
finding a brewing kit in his parents’ attic, while Watt studied law. However, after graduating he
was too much of a rebel to stay in the legal profession and soon left. They both shared one
passion: to brew beer. Not just any beer but beer they loved and that was different from the
mainstream. While Dickie was working for Thornbridge Brewery in Derbyshire as a brewer, Watt
was catching lobster and haddock as a fisherman and brewed beers with Dickie when ashore.
In 2005, at a showcase of Thornbridge beers in London, Dickie had the fortune to meet the
world-renowned ‘beer hunter’, the late Michael Jackson. He tasted their homebrews and told
them to start brewing full-time.
This was the kick-start they needed. They threw in their life savings and acquired a loan to rent
derelict premises to work in. They didn’t have the funds to buy stainless steel tanks but adapted
plastic ones. By spring 2007, their first batch was ready, and Dickie described the business as
‘myself and James and a dog’. Hence BrewDog was born. Unbeknown to them a recession was
looming, and no one wanted to buy their distinctive brew. They moved back in with their parents
to save money to keep their dream alive. But just around the corner was a piece of luck. Tesco,
the leading UK supermarket chain, was running a competition for craft beers. They entered four
of their brews and came first, second, third and fourth. This prompted Tesco to offer to stock
these beers throughout its stores. One problem: there was just the two of them filling the bottles
by hand. More loans, and income from Watt still working part-time on the boat, overcame the
problem and the brand just started to grow. But it still had a funding problem ….
Crowdfunding to the Rescue
The first time the word ‘crowdfunding’ was used was in 2006, but rock band Marillion is often
claimed to be the first recipient of this form of financing back in 1997, when fans sponsored
their US tour. For BrewDog this was going to be a lifesaver. The firm couldn’t cope with the
growth and was unable to access any other loans. So, in 2009, the Equity for Punks financing
model came into existence and BrewDog raised $975,000 from about 1,330 investors. Now in
its sixth round, Equity for Punks was most successful when it raised $34 million from 70,000
investors in early 2018 (Stoller 2020). As well as owning part of the company, these
shareholders would receive perks including a 10 per cent lifetime discount at BrewDog bars
and membership to BrewDog’s monthly beer club. The firm also sold a 23 per cent stake in
April 2017, for £213 million, to TSG Consumer Partners, a San Francisco-based private equity
investor, valuing BrewDog at £1 billion just nine years into its life. Now it had the resources,
what marketing activities could it come up with?
Marketing Stunts
Have Watt and Dickie found a new way to grow an insurgent brand? (Insurgent brands disrupt
by offering superior products and experiences that fulfil a true consumer need, often with a
strong founder-led story). With their unnerving passion, born from by producing great beer, and
using audacious stunts to communicate to their audience, are they extending the
boundaries? There are sceptics who say the stunts and the brand are inseparable.
Jon Kyme, a small real ale brewer in Cumbria, is one such: ‘The hype is so critically importantto BrewDog. In a sense, it’s their main product. It’s only in the hype that there is an absolute,
quantum gap between BrewDog and the rest. Their entire existence, basically, is marketing’
(Henley 2016).
Let’s look at some of those marketing stunts in detail.
Campaigns and Results
‘Bar on the Edge’ campaign
This campaign was based on the controversial building of a wall between Mexico and America
(Warc 2018). The objective was to help increase audience awareness of BrewDog in its recent
launch in America and stand out from the competition. BrewDog was to build a ‘Bar on the
Edge’ between Mexico and America, with the following slogan written on it: ‘Make Beer Not
Walls.’ The target audience was broad, but particularly included those who had a punk attitude
and love beer. There was also a hashtag: #MakeBeerNotWalls. This was only six months into
Donald Trump’s presidency and somewhat controversial. To coincide with this, BrewDog hosted
a beer event in its Columbus, Ohio, taproom, featuring Texan and Mexican beers.

‘Ratebeer’ campaign
The brief for this campaign was to drive mass awareness and trial of BrewDog with mainstream
beer drinkers, and wake up the ‘sleepwalking lager drinkers’ who order a Stella, a Bud or a
Foster’s out of habit. It aimed to change the behaviour of these beer drinkers and persuade
them to try a BrewDog Punk IPA. It goes without saying, this drive for awareness and trial
needed to be done in keeping with BrewDog’s provocative attitude. But this time, the brief was
to use traditional advertising media.
Source: Douglas Pfeiffer/Shutterstock
By now BrewDog was a fast-growing global brand, known for PR stunts like dropping taxidermy
cats out of helicopters onto Wall Street to highlight the ‘fat cats’. However, now was the time to
convert mainstream drinkers to the BrewDog cause. Its flagship brew, Punk IPA, is so
distinctive in flavour compared with the little taste difference between the UK’s four biggest￾selling lagers – Budweiser, Foster’s, Stella Artois and Carling – that in blind tasting it stands
out.
How to achieve this is what all agencies strive for. The light-bulb moment came: why not turn
these four iconic brands’ own campaigns against them? The how-to was even more ingenious.
Ratebeer.com is a website for beer geeks, who drink beer and then go online and rate it.
Ratebeer.com scores Carling at 1/100, Foster’s at 3/100, Stella at 9/100 and Budweiser at a
remarkable 0/100. (Ironically, AB InBev, Budweiser’s owner, owns Ratebeer.com, having
acquired it in 2017.) BrewDog Punk IPA scores 97/100.
Now to launch the campaign ….
Using the trademarked product designs of some of the world’s biggest brands in their
advertising, along with their slogans – like Fosters Good Call alongside its score of 3/100 next
to BrewDog Punk IPA’s 97/100 – gave outdoor, newspapers and social media platform owners
a problem: ‘Can we jeopardize our relationship with the big four by running a campaign from
this insurgent brand?’ Lawyers were brought in, and the campaign was launched.
The responseThe aim was to create a ‘buzz’, with everyone joining in with their own opinions. Some loved it,
others hated it. From Facebook to Twitter and articles in Marketing Week, the communication
wave kept running. In his Marketing Week article (‘Don’t just stand for something, stand against
your competitors’), Mark Ritson outlined his admiration for the campaign: ‘It’s a brilliant
campaign and makes the case for the “versus” approach better than any article. A billboard with
just BrewDog’s 97/100 score would have been hardly noticed and would certainly have sparked
significant cynicism about the nature of the rating system. But add your bigger, more famous
peers with their witheringly small ratings and everything changes’ (Ritson 2018).
Everything did change with the results. An independent study by YouGov (Shakespeare 2018)
on the campaign showed:
BrewDog’s brand awareness rose from +2 to +7
WOM (word of mouth, talking among friends and family) increased from +2 to +7.
Source: FotograFFF/Shutterstock
YouGov then asked current Stella, Budweiser, Foster’s and Carling drinkers, who had seen the
campaign but were already aware of the BrewDog brand, if they would consider buying
BrewDog Punk IPA. The results:
25 per cent of Stella’s current customers said they would buy Punk IPA
21 per cent of Carling’s
19 per cent of Budweiser’s
19 per cent of Foster’s.
In the words of YouGov: ‘The data shows that BrewDog made a well-judged move, as there is a
substantial proportion of mainstream beer drinkers who have the potential to be swayed. The
bold ad campaign has achieved cut-through.’
This risky and bold approach appears to have paid off and is true to the BrewDog ethos.
Not everything has run smoothly for BrewDog, however. A recent social media promotion that
claimed customers could win a ‘solid gold’ beer can was deemed misleading by the Advertising
Standards Authority (ASA). The brewer was offering consumers the chance to find a gold can
hidden in cases sold from its online store, but in two tweets and a Facebook post highlighted by
the ASA, it alluded to the prize being made from ‘solid gold’. After receiving their prize, some
winners complained to the ASA having discovered the cans were not in fact solid gold but gold￾plated. The ASA upheld the complaints made by 25 individuals and said three adverts were
misleading. BrewDog has attributed the error to a miscommunication between its marketing and
social media teams – they had meant to put ‘gold plated’ – but in true BrewDog style turned itpage 501
around by offering ‘diamond-encrusted gold cans or £25,000 in cash’ as a way of apologizing
for the error.
Marketing Rebels or Traditional Marketers?
During the last 16-plus years, BrewDog and its many marketing stunts have on many occasions
upset industry organizations like CAMRA (the Campaign for Real Ale), along with the ASA,
LGBT groups and rival brands, in its quest to be authentic. But this rebellious approach has led
to BrewDog becoming the 14th most valuable beer brand in the world.
The two friends from the small fishing village of Fraserburgh have come on a long journey, and
their apparent disregard for conventional marketing approaches has generated significant
market share. They have targeted a market of anarchic ale drinkers, with highly creative
campaigns, and in so doing have differentiated the brand from its competitors, generating
significant revenues and large numbers of brand-loyal followers – all laudable aims for a more
conventional marketing strategy. In the future, BrewDog may not be as resistant to planned
advertising as it was at the outset, as it is likely to face the threats of takeover that befall so
many authentic and innovative brands.
Questions
1. To what extent did BrewDog follow IMC principles in the early years of the brand’s
development?
2. Why do you think BrewDog reconsidered its decision not to use advertising?
3. Carry out desk research on BrewDog around its latest campaigns linked to its drive to
become carbon neutral. Evaluate the extent to which the brand is applying traditional ‘mass’
advertising methods.
This case study was written by Brian Searle, programme director MSc Marketing,
Loughborough University.

Communications Mix: Mass

ntegrated communications campaigns use different communication methods.
Mass-marketing communications primarily involve sending non-personal
messages to wide target audiences. These key tools are the focus of this
chapter and are discussed in the following order: advertising and product
placement, public relations (PR) and sponsorship, and sales promotions. The
chapter also explores the main media channels, building on coverage in the
previous chapter and looking specifically at media vehicle selection.Introduction
Mass communications can facilitate wide dispersion of brand and firm
messages. The simple and complex models of the communication processes
explain how messages spread (see Chapter 12). Mass communication tools,
advertising, product placement, PR, sponsorship and sales promotions are used
to provide the focus, style and tone of the message. This is then delivered to
the target audience by a variety of media channels. Each aspect shapes the
communication message and has an impact on how it might be received. For
example, highly emotional messages can trigger certain behaviours. Cadbury’s
‘Donate Your Words’ campaign, produced in partnership with charity Age UK,
was highly emotive. The brand campaign encouraged everyone to speak to
older people to help combat loneliness. The timing of the campaign was
particularly prescient as it was launched during the Covid-19 pandemic when
many older people were shielding for health reasons and at home alone for
long periods. The video advert, ‘The Originals’, was distributed on television
and YouTube, and revealed to viewing audiences the exciting and uplifting
lived experiences of older people: kissing the world’s greatest rock star,
becoming a champion bodybuilder, being photographed nude. The outcome of
the campaign was very positive for both brands, and Cadbury’s has continued
to grow its partnership with the charity (Barber 2020).
Video adverts delivered by broadcast and digital (web and mobile)
channels can touch our emotions in various ways, stimulating interest, desire
and action. Memorable adverts are found to create better value for a brand, and
sometimes ads are designed to irritate the viewing target audience so as to stick
in the forefront of their minds; Confused.com, Gocompare.com,
webuyanycar.com and Cillit Bang have all been pronounced among the most
irritating television commercials (Burn-Callander 2015). Digital media
channels offer both an opportunity (to reach vast audiences) and a challenge to
advertisers (ads can be skipped and avoided). The capacity to automatically
play adverts on social media channels, streaming services and during video
games can receive a mixed response, leaving some target audiences irritated
and annoyed, which makes such ads memorable but potentially detrimental to
advertisers. Younger target audiences are more likely to respond positively to
communications received in this manner as they are familiar with digital
channels and services. The dilemma is often that streaming services are ad￾supported, to allow consumers free access to content providing they arepage 505
exposed to the channels’ advertising. So in order to deliver memorable and
enjoyable adverts advertisers have to know their target market’s preferences
and how they will respond to automated adverts (Mazumder et al. 2021).

a communication eco-system, which also attracts millions of new customers.
HIDDEN GEM 13.1
Klarna, Uses Communications to Attract, Convert and
Retain Customers
Klarna is a fast-growing Swedish fintech (financial technology) firm, which has established a
different way of paying for goods online. Its buy-now-pay-later model gives its customers
flexibility when it comes to purchasing.
Background
The online brand’s first transaction was in a bookshop in Sweden in 2005. Founders
Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Niklas Adalbert and Victor Jacobsson had a vision: to make e￾commerce payments easy for buyers and sellers. At the Stockholm School of Economics, in
front of a panel of high-profile funders, they made a pitch, but their ideas were
not liked as they were seen to be too risky, not financially viable, and definitely
not something banks and financial institution would want to be involved with. But the
partners didn’t give up and the business started to grow alongside the demand for e￾commerce payment solutions. By 2011, they had created an international business, with
offices in Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, and managed to attract many savvy
investors. The Klarna checkout launched, offering a ‘buy now pay however you like’
approach to payments. Buyers and sellers loved it. In 2016, the Smoooth concept (with
three ‘o’s) launched with a series of quirky advertising videos that appeared everywhere
online, featuring fish, Afghan hounds, cheese, jelly and a whole lot more. Visit
www.klarna.com/international/klarna-history to see these effective adverts.Source: Retro AdArchives/Alamy Stock Photo
By 2018, the brand had a banking licence and its own mobile app. This gave it greater
legitimacy and ensured a streamlined purchasing experience for its customers. Also in this
year, the firm rebranded, preferring pink to blue to create the right impression for the
Smoooth shopping experience.
Klarna also signed up high-profile retail investors like H&M, and acquired UK finance firm
Close Brothers Retail Finance. Since then, the firm continued to expand and quickly
became a global shopping platform, with 147 million shoppers, 400,000 retail partners and 2
million transactions per day.
How does Smoooth shopping work?
What made the brand so different is the shopper can choose when to pay. Klarna has three
credit options: pay in three days, pay in 30 days and longer terms for more expensive items.
Each shopper has to pass a financial eligibility check to ensure they are able to pay. Once
accepted, using the shopping app is simple and straightforward, and can be used at any
shop. The retailer does not need to have partnered with Klarna, although there are 400,000
Klarna retailers worldwide, including H&M, ASOS, Made.com, Adidas and Samsung.
Business and marketing solutions
Klarna has a large global customer base of active shoppers, and it uses performance-driven
approaches to marketing. Using artificial intelligence (AI) to find shoppable content online,
its systems optimize retailers’ brand marketing goals and help grow its partners’ businesses.
By creating omnichannel marketing plans, businesses are introduced to new customers and
see significant uplifts in sales. For example, MATE Bike, a Copenhagen lifestyle brand,
makes affordable electric bikes, which appeal to a demographic of fun-loving sport and
fashion enthusiasts across Europe and the US. At prices between £1,700 and £2,500,
Klarna was used for its launch into the UK. Customers could choose to pay 10 per cent
followed by 24 monthly payments. Decisions are instant, so there is no delay in the
purchasing process. In the first year MATE Bike joined Klarna, it proved to be a game￾changer for the brand: it enjoyed a 50 per cent increase in sales and was introduced to new
customers, marketing agencies, web designers and other marketing support agencies,
enabling further expansion.
Marketing campaigns: get Smoooth Dogg
As well as giving its business partners access to sophisticated AI-driven marketing
solutions, Klarna also uses high-profile multichannel market campaigns to get in front of
potential target audiences. In 2019, its Smoooth Dogg campaign, featuring celebrity Snoop
Dogg, Afghan hounds and exotic pink settings to demonstrate the Smoooth principles, was
a global success, and enjoyed extensive press and social media coverage. The ‘Shop Like
A Queen’ campaign launched the app in the US, and global events (Smoooth Weeks) raised
awareness of the brand and its offer. US rapper, music producer and record executive A$AP
Rocky became part of a global campaign designed to help customers return to shopping
post-pandemic.
David Sandstrom, CMO for Klarna, says there is a sea-change in consumer behaviour,
which favours new ways of doing things. Klarna uses its influencer strategy to engage
directly with content creators and niche communities, to reach its customer base. Social
commerce also plays an important part in its approach to marketing communications.page 506
During the Covid pandemic, the brand saw an uplift in shoppers and was introduced to the
60-plus demographic, many of whom started shopping online during successive lockdowns.
This group of shoppers also do things differently and Klarna is finding ways to adapt its
marketing accordingly. Advertising spend on television and out-of-home advertising is
increasing, for instance, as this is a way to reach the new older demographics.
High-profile and precision marketing campaigns and events have enabled Klarna to grow to
become active in 20 markets globally, and it sees this as just the beginning ….

Social media: find Klarna on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn
Textual adverts in print media (e.g. newspapers, magazines) and on digital
channels can present rational and logical information-based arguments to
encourage target audiences to make a buying decision. Text can also be
accompanied by powerful imagery to both emotionally stimulate and provide
detailed arguments to persuade the message receiver to act. Hellmann’s award￾winning Food Pioneers’ ‘We’re On The Side Of Food’ global campaign used
print adverts, television, radio and social media, visually showcasing foods and
the people who eat them, and simultaneously highlighting the brand’s
commitment to responsible food production (Ogilvy 2017).
Innovative digital advertising formats are creating opportunities to appeal
to target audiences dynamically and can instantly be tailored to the consumers
viewing an advertising message. Heinz is experimenting with AI art,
generating algorithm DALL·E 2 to create images of its Tomato Ketchup bottle,
to determine the extent to which AI can develop innovative ad campaigns
(Kulp 2022). Ocean Outdoor is pioneering the use of large-screen digital
advertising screens to deliver digital out-of-home (DOOH) messages to target
audiences, using specialist vehicle- and facial-recognition technology (Ocean
Outdoor 2022).
Advertising in its many forms is not the only type of mass communication
tool to reach our emotions and foster engagement. PR, stories in the media and
organized events provide a source of public information and experience, which
can raise awareness and educate various publics (target audiences) about apage 507
brand and its corporate image. Carefully designed PR campaigns can enhance
corporate reputations and increase competitive advantage.
Sales promotions – another form of mass communication – are often used
to elicit action, and this technique is used widely in situations from selling fast￾moving consumer goods (FMCGs) to car finance. For example, electrical
retailer Currys regularly offers promotional discounts to encourage the
purchase of consumer electronics. Typical promotions offer customers the
opportunity to make financial savings, receive bonus items and enjoy free
delivery. HSBC Bank plc, in partnership with Visa, offers its customers
exclusive benefits and the opportunity to receive cashback when they shop
with certain brands; other offers include a 25 per cent discount when eating at
Italian restaurant chain Prezzo (HSBC 2022). This is just one type of sales
promotion; more are discussed later in the chapter.
Digital marketing offers scope to engage target audiences and create
communities using the web and social media platforms. For example, Nike is a
brand built on the use of innovative and differentiated creative advertising, to
engage target audiences across all media in its products and social issues using
campaigns featuring athletes and sports stars. For example, campaigns such as
its ‘Dream Crazy’, featuring footballer Marcus Rashford, targeting
homelessness and the fight against racism, and with skateboarder Sky Brown
(‘Who Said Woman Was Not Meant To Fly’), aim to empower the next
generation to achieve. Similarly, its ad featuring top professional tennis player
Naomi Osaka, ‘Hit The Ball As Loud As You Can’, advocated for more
attention to mental health (Nike 2022). In China, Nike used video, web and
social media to take the campaign to a different level, sending customers into a
virtual world as digital avatars which then appeared on a treadmill, running
past world heritage landmarks in its ‘Reactland’. Recently, as an attention￾grabbing advertising stunt – ‘Running Makes The World Go Round’ – Nike
launched an interactive event in Shanghai, where an athlete appeared to be
running on a 50-metre-high globe. Celebrities joined in to have their images
projected on to the top of the world. The aim was to get the message across to
Chinese consumers of the importance of running for personal health. The event
gained attention but was eventually shut down by the Shanghai police, creating
even further interest (Wieden+Kennedy 2022).These are examples of the variety of ways in which mass communications
are used to communicate with target audiences. Using the digital media
channels creatively is transcending the divide between broadcast and print
media, creating opportunities for developing highly dynamic and creative
campaigns. Digital marketing is covered in detail in Chapters 14 and 15.
Broadly speaking, advertising, product placement and PR raise awareness,
while sales promotion is used to stimulate action. But each of these tools has
much more to offer a marketing manager who is planning an integrated
marketing communications campaign. They are now explored in more detail.
Advertising
What is the role of advertising? How does it work? When should it be used
and how can we evaluate its effectiveness? These questions have challenged
academics and practitioners alike, and filled thousands of pages of hundreds of
publications. Jones (1991) explained how advertising can persuade, while
Barnard and Ehrenberg suggested it is more about ‘nudging’ the buyer towards
a decision and reinforcing their perceptions of a brand (Barnard and Ehrenberg
1997). Industry experts have their own views: John Hegarty, co-founder of
creative agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH), says success in advertising
comes from the big idea, and he emphasizes the high importance of creativity
in differentiating a brand. For Sir Martin Sorrell – founder of WWP, the
world’s largest advertising agency group – it is all about the capacity to
deliver return on investment (Tylee 2018; Statista 2022). And just when you
think you might have some answers, throw into the debate ‘disruptive
technology’, where technology entrepreneurs Page and Brin (Google),
Zuckerberg (Facebook and Meta) and Jack Ma (Alibaba) have created new
networked environments that have changed how, when and where we all
communicate.
As well as digital media changing the way we communicate through
advertising and the nature of the content of the messages we use to influence
others, digital advertising is measurable, making it easier to see how customers
respond to messages delivered through digital channels. For example, Argos
used Skyview as a research tool to evaluate the effectiveness of its intensive
television advertising campaigns and learn how to improve the efficiency of its
investment in advertising. Skyview is a panel of more than 500,000 homes thatpage 508
have Sky boxes to record their viewing behaviour; this data is linked to EPG
(electronic programme guide) mapping and Mosaic Lifestyles, to give greater
insights into shoppers’ purchasing habits. The Sky viewing panel was matched
with Argos customer records using Sky’s data technology, giving a panel of
280,000, which enabled the customer research to draw results from 1.4 billion
viewing events each month. The digital media analytics showed Argos how
consumers responded to television advertising, the impact of varying the
length of ads, and how the timing and frequency of showings impacted its
retail sales. With this information, it was possible to identify the optimal times
and frequencies for advertising. Argos saw an improvement of 8 per cent, year
on year, for its TV targeting, and shopping rates increased threefold, as each
category advertised enjoyed the halo effect of wider product sales not
advertised (SkyMedia 2016). Tesco used SmartScreen out-of-home (OOH)
digital advertising screens in its stores throughout the UK and was thus able to
monitor reach, which extended to 75 per cent of its customers (Glenday 2022).
So where do we start to investigate advertising? First, we look at the role
of advertising and the theories seeking to explain how it works, and then we
look at when advertising should be used. Finally, we discuss how its
effectiveness can be measured.
The Role of Advertising
Advertising helps brands to establish a connection with their target audiences,
to communicate with them, and engage their interest through appeals, stories
and messages. More specifically, advertising is generally used to persuade and
encourage message receivers to respond, to meet various communication
objectives – for example, adverts may be used to raise awareness, stimulate
interest and increase engagement. To deliver operational value from
advertising, it is important to set clear communication objectives. Advertising
can differentiate and position products and services in customers’ minds,
correct misconceptions, remind and reinforce, and provide support for the sales
force.Create awareness
Advertising can create awareness of a firm, a brand, a website, an event or
something of interest to target audiences. It can even alert buyers to a solution
to a problem. For example, Colgate toothpaste can stop plaque, bad breath, and
tooth and gum decay. Discount supermarket Lidl aims to help its customers
deal with the problem of the cost of shopping with its ‘Shop Smarter’ and ‘Too
Good To Be True’ campaigns. Consequently, it is generally agreed advertising
can help to legitimize a firm, its products, brands and sales teams in the minds
of the target audience. In doing so, it can also improve acceptance of what a
firm has on offer. Brand awareness is considered a precondition of purchase
and can be achieved through advertising. Advertising is a means of informing
target audiences, and encouraging recall and recognition; awareness is
necessary for successful communication. Level of awareness is important to
advertisers, as customers need to instantly recall a brand or product if they are
to make a purchase.
Stimulate trial
Advertising can create interest and stimulate trial. The sale of some products
can suffer because of lack of trial. Marketing research has shown once
consumers try a product, acceptance is higher, but if for some reason only a
small proportion of the target group go on to buy the product, advertising can
be used to focus customers and stimulate trial. For example, jackfruit (see
Exhibit 13.1) grows easily without pesticides and artificial irrigation, and is a
good, versatile food source that is 100 per cent vegan. Jack & Bry produce
award-winning plant-based ‘meats’ using jackfruit, making sausages and
mince products (with the texture and taste of meat equivalents) to target the
growing market of vegans. As the market for these products grows the firm is
investing in marketing to raise brand awareness and encourage a wider range
of customers to try its product ranges, which include jackfruit peperoni. The
brand also sells its products to Papa John’s and Zizzi for use in making pizzas.
Demand for meat-free products is predicted to grow and the market to be
worth US$7.1 billion by 2025, giving Jack & Bry great potential to expand its
business (Devlin 2021).

Differentiate and position products in customers’
minds
Advertising is a way brands set themselves apart from their competitors.
Today, most goods work in the way they are expected to, as the ramifications
of a customer revolt (over, say, a faulty product) through social media can
destroy a brand’s reputation very quickly. So how do marketers make their
cars, chocolates, wine or clothing stand out from the crowd? Advertising copy
and visuals have a major role to play in positioning brands in the minds of
their target audience (Ries and Trout 2001). Creative positioning involves the
development or reinforcement of an image or set of associations for a brand
(see Exhibit 13.2). Brands often use advertising campaigns to differentiate
them from competitors: McDonald’s claimed longer opening hours than
Burger King; BMW claimed it produces better-quality vehicles than Audi
(Bambauer-Sachse and Heinzle 2018).
EXHIBIT 13.2

solutions that match consumer preferencespage 509

Global advertising and media agency Saatchi & Saatchi suggested it is a
matter of love and respect, which helps a brand stand out from the crowd. It
developed its ‘Lovemarks’ matrix, where brands ‘owned by the people
[customers] who love them, and [brand owners] use their respect equity to
build new mysterious, sensual and intimate relationships’. Lovemark status
was achieved not only by getting the storytelling associated with a brand right,
and connecting it in a logical and coherent way from the past to the future, but
also by tapping in to customer emotions to inspire and excite. However, some
goods have a head start. For example, we might know green beans are better
for us than sweets and are something we need to eat, but the sugar boost makes
confectionary more likely to be a heart-pumping want than a plate of healthy
vegetables, which means it is easier for us to love a bag of M&M’s than a
packet of Florette salad mix. According to Dina Howell, former worldwide
CEO at Saatchi & Saatchi, a want is more powerful than a need and unlocking
its potential requires firms to:
know the market, understanding the culture and triggers that might prompt
emotion and excitement
know the channel and what it has to offer
know the shopper.
In the US, for example, 86 per cent of purchases in-store are made by
women. So when Quaker Oats asked Saatchi & Saatchi for help, together they
devised the ‘Power Their Potential’ campaign. The challenge was to get
children to concentrate more at school (by eating breakfast and healthy snacks)and at the same time to give parents an easy solution for providing children
with the ‘fuel’ they needed to get them through to lunchtime. The solution was
a combination of brands of hot cereals and ready-to-eat healthy snacks and
cookies that were highly visible when parents went shopping. Using in-store
displays and online media, the campaign enabled Quaker to increase its market
share (Howells 2015; Roberts 2015a, 2015b; Saatchi & Saatchi 2015).
Digital marketing has shifted the emphasis and, while brand stories remain
important, consumer expectations are more practical, and rely on feedback and
real experiences. The difference with today’s relationships is the need to
constantly refresh the meaning of a brand and what it has to offer its loyal
customers (Lazzarotto 2021).
Aaker and colleagues (1996) identified seven ways to identify a
differentiated market position:
1. Product characteristics and customer benefits: for example, Ryanair
launched an advertising campaign to let its customers know about changes
to its previously restrictive baggage rules, the introduction of seating
allocation and improvements to its online booking website. The airline also
offers other brands the opportunity to advertise on boarding passes, which
travellers view many times during their flights. Ford Fiesta uses its high￾tech features to promise drivers safe and hassle-free driving – for example,
Wi-Fi hotspot, driver assist, voice-controlled navigation and entertainment
system, active parking assistance, EcoBoost, low-speed safety system, and
traffic sign recognition – to portray its car’s benefits to the user, and this is
summed up in the statement ‘Ford Fiesta – Together We Go Further’.
Another tactic used for positioning is being first. For example, Sky
News claims the number-one position with respect to its claim to be ‘first
for breaking news’. Occasionally, two or more attributes are used, as with
Ecover laundry liquid (cleans clothes with its non-biological ingredients and
is good for the environment as it uses less packaging and fewer transport
miles). L’Oréal Men Expert Pure Power claims to help improve skin by
making it cleaner.
2. Price: this positioning approach focuses on price as a weapon to deliver
higher value to consumers. Many airlines use price as a differentiator (e.g.
low-cost airlines like Air Asia, easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air), as do
supermarket private-label brands (Sainsbury’s promotes low-price lines
branded under its Basics range, while Morrisons has its M Saver range).
Price positioning is not always focused on low prices, however.page 510
Occasionally a brand is positioned based on its high price, as is the case
with Stella Artois beer (‘reassuringly expensive’).
3. Product use: another positioning method is to associate the product with a
use. Examples are: Cillit Bang, with its ‘power to wow’ cleaning products,
which are easy to use, and shift dirt and grime easily; Samsung reintroduced
its flip-phone using a social media campaign to showcase the new Galaxy Z
Flip4 foldable phone in video adverts demonstrating its convenience and
ease of use (Kemp 2022).
4. Product user: another way of positioning is to associate a brand with a user
or user type. Designer fashion brand Polo by Ralph Lauren portrayed its
users as bohemian romantics who live life on the beach, with an interest in
fashion, art and music; the brand aims its classic collections at younger
audiences. Celebrity endorsements are often used, for example Kylie Jenner
(Adidas, Puma, Calvin Klein), Michael Jordan and Rafael Nadal (Nike), Eva
Longoria (L’Oréal) and Brad Pitt (Chanel No. 5). Fashion models Kendall
Jenner, Karlie Kloss, and Bella and Gigi Hadid, with large social media
followings, have become powerful influencers for brands like Versace,
Fendi, Maybelline and Pepsi (Fleming 2018).
5. Product class: some products can benefit by positioning
themselves within a product class. For example, the margarine I
Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter is positioned within the butter class by virtue
of its name and advertising; another such example is This Is Not Milk by
Alpro, which is a 100 per cent plant-based version of dairy milk; finally,
there is the enduring classic ‘Beanz Meanz Heinz’.
6. Symbols: the use of symbols to position brands in the marketplace has been
achieved by Michelin (the Michelin man), McDonald’s (golden arches) and
Apple (white apple logo). The use of symbols is particularly effective when
the symbol reflects a quality desired in the brand, as with the Andrex puppy
(softness).
7. Competition: positioning against well-entrenched competitors can be
effective, since their image in the marketplace can be used as a reference
point. For example, Subaru positioned against Volvo by claiming ‘Volvo has
built a reputation for surviving accidents. Subaru has built a reputation for
avoiding them’, based on its ABS for better braking and four-wheel drive for
better traction. Dyson positions itself against the competition by claiming
that, unlike those of its rivals, its vacuum cleaners do not lose suction,
thanks to Dyson’s patented technology. Adidas positions its products againstother brands of trainers (e.g. Nike). In its ‘Steadicam’ campaign, a runner in
the desert is wearing Nike trainers, but the cameraman, carrying a heavy
camera and filming the event, is wearing Adidas. The message is: Adidas
trainers offer better performance and enable users to remain fresh and lively,
even after an extreme run. Positioning against competitors can be effective
when consumers base their purchase decision on facts. Hence, a well￾adjusted statement claiming a factual advantage against a key competitor
can be highly successful. However, research has shown that, if used
inappropriately, such positioning can tarnish the image of the brand that is
using the technique. There is also the risk of legal action. Aldi upset Tesco
with its ‘Swap & Save’ campaign. Aldi claimed 84 out of 98 people had
saved money by switching to shopping with the discount supermarket. Tesco
disagreed, and the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned Aldi’s
advert, claiming it was misleading to customers. (In the UK, the ASA is an
independent regulator that controls advertising standards across all media.).
Supermarket brands constantly battle over prices, with discounters Aldi and
Lidl repeatedly using adverts in which they claim to be cheaper than their
larger rivals and crossing the ASA (Butler 2022).
Correct misconceptions
Correcting any misconceptions consumers hold with regard to brands can be
achieved with carefully designed advertising campaigns. Millions can be spent
on repositioning a brand in the minds of consumers. For example, Unilever’s
£12.5 million ‘Powered By Plants’ campaign was designed to celebrate the
plant-based ingredients of its Flora spreads and position them as all-vegetable
alternatives to butter. This approach has delivered positive results, and the
FMCG manufacturer’s sustainable living brands are driving growth (Willan
2017). McCain’s, the market leader in the UK for oven chips, ran a successful
advertising campaign claiming oven chips contained 40 per cent less fat than
home-cooked chips. However, marketing research showed consumers still
believed McCain’s oven chips contained 30 per cent fat. A new campaign was
designed to correct this misconception by stating the oven chips contained
only 5 per cent fat. Old Spice, owned by P&G, was once seen as a fragrance
for old men, grandads and dads; it was repositioned in 2010 when Isaiah
Mustafa said ‘Hello Ladies’ in an ad campaign that created a new personality
for the brand, introducing humour, fun and vigour. In 2020, Isaiah returned –
this time as an ‘embarrassing old dad’ himself – but with his son (actor Keithpage 511
Powers) already using a range of Ultra Smooth Old Spice products (Graham
2020). The recent campaign, which uses influencers, digital channels and TV
ads, sought to capture the attention of Gen Z consumers with a new range.
Service providers also use this type of advertising. Costa Coffee – like
many businesses in the food and leisure business – suffered during the
pandemic due to lockdowns, closures, social distancing and many other
restrictions. In the summer of 2022 (when all restrictions were lifted in the
UK), the brand wanted to dispel past fears associated with the pandemic and
encourage its customers to enjoy every day. The campaign, ‘FrappéLists’,
brought together day-long music playlists of up-and-coming artists inspired by
the coffee shop’s range of frappés to give Gen Z soundtracks for the
restriction-free summer (Anon 2022).
Remind and reinforce
Once a clear position in the minds of the target audience has been established,
the objective of advertising may be to remind consumers of the brand’s
existence and to reinforce its image. For many leading brands in mature
markets, such as PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Heinz Beans and Nestlé’s KitKat, the
objective of their advertising is to maintain top-of-mind awareness
and favourable associations. Given leading brands’ strong market
positions, a major advertising task is to defend against competitive inroads,
and thus maintain high sales, market share and profits. Guinness has managed
to maintain its position for more than 250 years, making it one of the world’s
most successful alcoholic drink brands (see Exhibit 13.3).

Advertising Expenditure
Fulfilling the various roles often requires significant resources, and every year
vast sums of money are spent on developing advertising campaigns. Digital
media have changed how we consume advertising and shifted how the
advertising budget is allocated to the various media. For many years, print
media were where most of this money was spent. Figure 13.1 shows how firms
in the UK spend their advertising budgets.
FIGURE 13.1
Global media investment, 2022page 512
Source: AA/WARC expenditure report
Globally, the market for advertising spend has grown beyond expectations
and, even though the Covid-19 pandemic impacted growth rates, markets have
largely recovered and global ad spend is predicted to reach US$1 trillion by
2025, a significant proportion of this going to Alphabet (Google), Meta
(Facebook) and Amazon Prime (Serrano 2022). Online video advertising has
grown in popularity, with more than 60 per cent of marketers planning to
introduce TikTok, Instagram and YouTube video ads. Social media, mobile and
search advertising – keyword advertising through search engines – attract a
large amount of spend, with Alphabet being the most popular platform, and
many marketers are planning to increase their use of these digital media.
Online audio is growing increasingly popular, with Spotify the main channel
for this type of advertising spend. Traditional media (television, OOH, cinema
and radio) have largely returned to pre-pandemic levels of spend, while print
advertising (newspapers and magazines) continues to decline. Online editions
have helped some publications retain market share using digital display
advertising and online classified ads (Serrano 2022) (see Figure 13.1).
Setting advertising expenditure requires consideration of the budget,
something that involves the analysis of many variables. The achievement of
any of the roles for advertising outlined above will depend upon the size of the
budget and how effectively it is spent.How Advertising Works
For many years, there has been considerable debate about how advertising
works. The consensus is there can be no single all-embracing theory
explaining how all advertising works, because advertising has varied tasks
(Wright and Crimp 2003). For example, advertising attempting to encourage
an instant sale by incorporating a return coupon that can be used to order a
product is very different from corporate image advertising designed to
reinforce attitudes and shape beliefs. There is, however, agreement that
persuasion forms a fundamental part of advertising and marketing
communications (Kerr and Richards 2021).
Two competing views on how advertising works are the strong theory of
advertising and the weak theory of advertising (Jones 1991). The strong
theory has its base in the US and is shown on the left-hand side of Figure 13.2.
According to this theory, a person passes through the stages of awareness,
interest, desire and action (AIDA); advertising is strong enough to increase
people’s knowledge and change people’s attitudes, and therefore is capable of
persuading people who had not previously bought a brand to buy it. It is
therefore a conversion theory of advertising: non-buyers are converted to
buyers. Advertising is assumed to be a powerful influence on consumers.
FIGURE 13.2
Strong and weak theories of how advertising worksThis model has been criticized on two grounds (Ehrenberg 1992). First, for
many types of product there is little evidence consumers experience a strong
desire before action (buying the brand). For example, in the case of an
inexpensive product, a brand might be bought on a trial basis without any
strong conviction it is superior to competing brands. Second, the model is
criticized because it is limited to the conversion of a non-buyer to a buyer. It
ignores what happens after action (i.e. first purchase). Yet, in most mature
markets, advertising is designed to affect people who have already bought the
brand at least once.
The major alternative to the strong theory of advertising is the weak theory
of advertising, shown on the right-hand side of Figure 13.2. The steps in this
model are awareness, trial and reinforcement (ATR). The ATR model, which
has received support in Europe, suggests advertising is a much less powerful
influence than the strong theory would suggest. As Ehrenberg explains,
‘Advertising can first arouse awareness and interest, nudge some customers
towards a doubting first trial purchase (with the emphasis on trial, as in maybe
I’ll try it) and then provide some reassurance and reinforcement after that first
purchase. I see no need for any strong AIDA-like Desire or Conviction before
the first purchase is made’ (Ehrenberg 1992). Ehrenberg’s work in fast-movingpage 513
consumer goods (FMCG) markets has shown loyalty to one brand is rare. Most
consumers purchase a selection of brands. The proportions of total purchases
represented by the different brands show little variation over time, and new
brands join the selection only in exceptional circumstances. A major objective
of advertising in such circumstances is to defend brands: it does not work to
increase sales by bringing new buyers to the brand advertised; its main
function is to retain existing buyers and sometimes to increase the frequency
with which they buy the brand (Jones 1991). Therefore the target is existing
buyers who are well disposed to the brand (otherwise they would not buy it),
and advertising is designed to reinforce these favourable perceptions, so
consumers continue to buy the brand (Dall’Olmo Riley et al. 1997). Level of
involvement also has an important role in determining how people make
purchasing decisions. Jones (1991) suggested involvement may also explain
when the strong and weak theories apply.
For high-involvement decisions such as the purchase of expensive
consumer durables, cars and complex financial services products, the decision￾making process is thorough, with many alternatives considered and an
extensive information search undertaken. Advertising, therefore, is more likely
to follow the strong theory either by creating a strong desire to purchase (as
with mail order) or by convincing people they should find out more about the
brand (e.g. by visiting a showroom). Since the purchase is
expensive, it is likely a strong desire (or conviction) is required
before purchase takes place.
However, for low-involvement purchase decisions (such as low-cost
packaged goods), people are less likely to consider a wide range of brands
thoroughly before purchase, and it is here the weak theory of advertising
almost certainly applies. Advertising is mainly intended to keep consumers
doing what they already do by providing reassurance and reinforcement.
Advertising repetition will be important in maintaining awareness and keeping
the brand among the consumer’s selection of brands from which individual
purchases will be chosen.
Moving beyond strong and weak theories of advertising, researchers
(Bleakley et al. 2022; Schultz et al. 2022) argue the Elaboration Likelihood
Model (ELM) introduced by Petty and Cacioppo (1981a) gives us a model of
advertising that encapsulates attitudinal change and the use of persuasive cues
(Bleakley et al. 2022). It is important to understand attitudinal change if we are
to get to the bottom of why certain behaviours occur in response to the
stimulus of a piece of advertising. The ELM aims to explain how humansprocess stimuli (Geddes 2016). Exhibit 13.4 shows a cartoon image that
captures the essence of the ELM. The cartoon mouse has different options
(stimuli to interact with) to reach the cheese. Whichever choice the mouse
makes, the next mouse may make a different decision based on its past
experiences and willingness to become involved.
EXHIBIT 13.4
How will the mouse react to different stimuli?

The ELM presents the idea that there are two different routes a person may
follow when responding to advertising messages (see Figure 13.3):
1. the central route – high processing of the advertiser’s message equals high
elaboration
2. the peripheral route – low processing of the advertiser’s message equals low
elaboration.
FIGURE 13.3
The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) modelSource: Higgins et al., 2012
The route people take will be influenced by their levels of motivation and
cognitive ability when processing advertising messages. Petty and Cacioppo
(1981a, 1981b) tested the theory by exposing different groups of people to
adverts for a disposable razor. One group were encouraged to be highly
involved with the product, while the other group were not provided with the
same stimulus and therefore were assumed to have low involvement.page 514
The ELM is widely used in advertising research. It is respected by
academics for being well constructed and able to accommodate many different
outcomes (in response to advertising), and is cited as ‘very instrumental in
understanding when and how attitude change occurs’ and as a model for
explaining the persuasion effect in advertising (El Hedhli and Zourrig 2022).
Bleakley et al. (2022) found clear persuasive strategies are used to target
young consumers with sports and energy drinks by applying the ELM model.
Peripheral cues were found in on-screen adverts, showing the consumption of
beverages in positive settings emphasizing athletic performance and fostering
positive associations with the brands, while negative aspects of drinking
sugary drinks were not shown in this manner. Moreover, marketers need to be
aware of the context and the media environment in which they seek to apply
the principles of the ELM; it has certain limitations, as actual behaviour is not
necessarily as clear-cut as the model suggests, and people may engage in dual
processing and follow both the central and the peripheral route simultaneously
(Kitchen et al. 2014). Shi et al. (2018) applied the ELM in a social media
context and found the central and peripheral route behaviours to be evident
among Twitter users. The researchers chose to use the ELM to find out why
some tweets go viral, as understanding this could help marketers promote
brands online. Oreo cookies offer one such example: the brand created a
Twitter storm by tweeting ‘You can still dunk in the dark’ when the power
failed during a particularly intense Super Bowl game. There were strong
connections and relevance, and individuals readily retweeted the message to
friends and family. Shi et al.’s study found there is a wealth of information in
social media networks but a ‘scarcity of attention’, so the context is important.
Users of social media platforms are much less receptive to unsolicited
messages than to those from a trusted source.
Shi et al. (2018) also found the ELM is suitable for planning campaigns
designed to encourage retweeting behaviour. To influence a person using the
central route, the content of a tweet should match the individual’s topical
preferences: for example, if a cosmetics brand is linked to a celebrity favoured
by the individual, that person is more likely to pay attention to the tweet.
Marketers can provide rich information content to stimulate higher elaboration.
To engage individuals who follow the peripheral route is more challenging inpage 515
social media networks, but if clusters of similar minded individuals (with
similar needs) are identified, then they can be targeted successfully.

audiences a choice of media might help them to engage with brand advertising.

Nordic Brands Invite Audiences to Experience the
Benefits of a Brutal Landscape
Arguably, Volvo cars, Arla yoghurt and Finlandia vodka share a common message theme in
their adverts: they want their customers to know how the harsh Nordic environment and the
strength needed to survive builds better brands. But why might the brooding, melancholy
film produced by Volvo attract more car buyers? And how does Arla’s journey of a young
boy across Iceland’s desolate landscapes help sell yoghurt? Why might spending over two
minutes viewing snippets of Nordic wisdom encourage us to drink more vodka?

Gratification researchers offer some insight into why such approaches might work. Uses
and gratifications theory (UGT) suggests audiences voluntarily engage with media
motivated by their own needs and goals. And their reward for actively participating in the
communication process (e.g. viewing adverts on television, downloading video on demand
and sharing via social media) is the gratification that results. UGT hangs on the premise that
it is different to mass communication theories because it endows the consumer of the media
with the power to determine which media they engage with rather than being passively
captivated by powerful brand messages. Researchers in this field suggest various ways inpage 516
which audiences achieve gratification and satisfy their needs. For example, utility is seen as
using the media to achieve certain tasks; selectivity is seen as audiences using the media
to support their own interests and beliefs; and personal interest is seen as serving
psychological needs through reassurance and self-understanding.
So when Volvo decided to adopt a global approach to communications, it produced its
Nordic noir film as the centrepiece of the campaign. In the advert (a four-minute film), a
Volvo car is shown traversing the tough Nordic landscape accompanied by emotive music
and lyrics to match. Viewers were invited to experience and gain insights into how these
extremes ensure Volvo cars are able to deal with all eventualities. The brand continues to
use this positioning for its vehicles and music plays an important role in reinforcing some of
Volvo’s core values: freedom and safety. The Volvo XC40 hybrid advert is accompanied by
1960s classic rock song ‘Born to be wild’, performed by US songwriter Natalie Taylor. The
song ‘Lean on’ is featured in an advert showing children being transported in comfort and
safety. Engaging with these adverts arguably reassures car buyers that a car made by
Sweden offers performance and safety for the precious things in life.
There are also gains for those who engage with the advert for Arla Skyr Icelandic yoghurt.
The personal benefits are said to be the offer of a healthy alternative and giving health￾conscious consumers ‘a great treat after exercise, since protein contributes to maintaining
and growing muscle mass’. In the advert launching the brand in the UK, the journey of a boy
named Orri shows him delivering an important message, seeking to convey that nothing is
too difficult once you’ve eaten Arla, a product with 1,000 years’ worth of heritage. In the
latest advert for Skyr Creamy, consumers are made aware of a new version of the brand
with the phrase, ‘To really appreciate it you have to experience it, like so many natural
wonders in Iceland’, reinforcing the heritage of the brand with background views of the
Northern Lights.
With Finlandia vodka, audiences are offered insight and wisdom from quirky individuals. If
they engage with this knowledge collective, amassed from 1,000 years (combined age of
the knowledge providers in the advert) of insight, it offers a guide to vodka drinkers on how
they might live a ‘life less ordinary’.
Possibly, these and other brands do look for ways to engage their audiences and give
something back. As media channels become more fragmented and digital platforms more
widely used, there are more opportunities to deliver benefits that go beyond the simple
message of ‘buy more product’.

When to Use Advertising
Planning campaigns and the FCB matrixAdverts that provide factual information can aid consumers who are uncertain
about making a purchasing decision. But how much information is required?
Which media channels should be used and how frequently should the message
be repeated? These questions are often asked by marketers planning to use
advertising. Richard Vaughn, director of advertising research at Foote, Cone &
Belding (FCB), a global advertising agency, developed the FCB matrix as an
aid to writing advertising copy – an aid that could potentially take account of
consumer behaviour. Figure 13.4 shows an adapted version of the FCB matrix.
FIGURE 13.4
FCB matrix
Based on: Vaughn (1980)
In its simplest form, the FCB matrix enables advertising planners to
consider whether a product (or service) is high or low involvement, and where
it might be positioned on a scale of the emotional connection a consumer
might attach to its purchase. Depending on whether the consumer is making a
rational low-involvement purchase or a high-involvement highly emotional
purchase, the matrix can aid decision-making about when to use particular
types of advertising message.
The matrix is composed of four quadrants (as depicted in Figure 13.4):
Quadrant 1 (Q1) decisions are high involvement and require information to
enable consumers to think through their decision-making, for example when
buying a car, a computer, financial investment products or high-valuepage 517
jewellery. Products that fall into this area need advertising formats that can
help the consumer learn about the product and develop positive feelings
before they are likely to make a purchase. On the Rolex website, for
example, powerful imagery showcases the features of Rolex watches; there
is also detailed product information, as well as information about the history
of the brand, and where and how to buy the products from an exclusive
network of retailers around the world. Haley and Pittman (2022) agree on
the ‘thinking-orientated’ perspective and suggest using search engines,
search engine optimization (SEO) and paid search through Google.
LinkedIn and Redditt are also useful platforms in scenarios involving this
quadrant. A brand website is also an ideal place for shoppers to find the
information they need to inform their decision-making.
Quadrant 2 (Q2) decisions are also high involvement, and strong emotional
considerations like ego and self-esteem feature in the decision-making
process. Fragrances and luxury fashion tend to fall into this quadrant. These
types of products require consumers to feel emotionally connected to the
product before they want to learn more and then make a purchase. Glossy
magazines, television and web advertising can be effective for creating
powerful visual and experiential campaigns. Chanel has used glamorous
celebrities like Marion Cotillard and Gabrielle in luxurious settings to invite
its customers to feel freedom, elegance and independence before
considering whether to make this all-important personal purchase (Niven￾Phillips 2017; Chanel 2022). Haley and Pittman (2022) suggest social media
is appropriate for this quadrant, tapping in to consumer emotions and the
affective aspects of purchase decision-making. Facebook, YouTube and
Pinterest are channels that can stimulate feeling.
Quadrant 3 (Q3) focuses on low-involvement decisions, which involve
routinely purchased items such as laundry liquids – items that have practical
use in our daily lives. The tendency is for the consumer to buy first then
experience the product, and develop feeling and attitudes after purchase.
With this type of habitual purchasing, advertising should seek to remind and
reinforce. FMCG brands regularly use catchy tunes, jingles and lyrics to
achieve this, for example the Cadbury’s classic ‘Finger of fudge is just
enough to give the kids a treat’, Proctor & Gamble’s Fairy Liquid ‘Hands
that do dishes can feel soft as your face’ and Nike’s ‘Just do it’ capture the
essence of this quadrant. In this quadrant, advertisers are seeking to shape
longer-term behaviours and encourage habit formation. Twitter
users are regularly exposed to news and opinions, and research hasshown a link between top trending topics and better response rates to
advertising messages. This platform’s users seek new information and can
be willing to try new things (do–learn–feel) (Lambrecht et al. 2018).
Quadrant 4 (Q4) decisions are also low involvement but are about pleasure￾seeking and the potential to be quickly satisfied. Outdoor advertising can be
effective here, as it arouses immediate interest and stimulates action; it also
enables consumers to develop feelings and finally to learn about their
product decisions. Benetton’s controversial billboard campaigns worked in
this way and were initially very successful in building the brand globally
(see Exhibit 13.5). Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram are good platforms for
this quadrant, according to Haley and Pittman (2022), as the positive
emotions and entertainment provided can motivate lower-involvement
purchase decisions relating to oneself.

The FCB matrix has been criticized for being overly simplistic because
informational motivations cannot be so easily classified, as there are multiple
layers of motives that are dependent on the mental state of the consumer
(Rossiter and Percy 1987). However, Claeys et al. (1995) tested the basic
principles of the model and concluded they were valid, adding that when
thinking about products consumers also use their emotions, so this should be
taken into consideration when planning the use of advertising. The greater the
‘emotional involvement’, the stronger the emotional message. For example,
luxury fragrances use highly emotional messages, as this is a very personal
product choice. Ghosh and colleagues (2019) applied the FCB matrix to the
purchase of organic foods and found this a high-involvement product where
learn–feel–do (Quadrant 1) applies. For marketing managers, they concluded it
is important to be aware of post-purchase dissonance, and find ways to useadvertising and promotional strategies to increase levels of consumer
knowledge and understanding early in the purchase decision process.
Moreover, Haley and Pittman (2022) suggest, in today’s complex world of
communication with multiple channels and ways to engage consumers, the
strategic value of the FCB matrix is very useful when using digital channels
and social media to reach fragmented target audiences.
Target audience
Deciding when to use advertising and which type of advertising format to use
will be dependent on the target audience at which the advertisement is aimed.
In consumer markets, the target audience may be defined in terms of socio￾economic group, age, gender, location, buying frequency (e.g. heavy versus
light buyers) and/or lifestyle. In organizational markets, target audience may
be defined in terms of role (e.g. purchasing manager, managing director) and
industry type.
Message decisions
Once the target audience has been identified, it needs to be understood. Buyer
motives and choice criteria need to be analysed. Choice criteria are those
factors buyers use to evaluate competing products. Understanding criteria in
line with the needs of the target audience is vital – doing so has fundamental
implications for message and media decisions.
Advertising messages should clearly communicate with the target
audience, be important to them, communicate benefits and aim to secure
competitive advantage. This is why an understanding of the motives and
choice criteria of the target audience is essential for effective advertising.
Without this knowledge, a campaign could be built upon an advertising
platform that is irrelevant to its audience.
Media decisions
Media planning is an important part of deciding when to use advertising. It has
changed significantly in recent years, with digital media accounting for a much
larger part of the communication budget.page 518
Building on the discussion in Chapter 12, we discuss media channels and
the implications of channel choice. Each of the media can be used to carry
different types of message – consequently, media selection can be complex.
The five aspects to be considered when selecting media are:
1. Creative factors: The key question that needs to be addressed is ‘Does the
medium allow the communication objectives to be realized?’ For example, if
the objective is to position the brand as having a high-status aspirational
personality, then television or a carefully planned PR or digital media
campaign may be best. If the communication objective is to remind the
target audience of a brand, then a poster campaign or outdoor media may be
better. Outdoor media are becoming more dynamic thanks to technological
advancements that mean many of the benefits of television can be conveyed
to outdoor adverts. JCDecaux is an example of a firm making use of new
technology to bring outdoor advertising to life (see
www.jcdecaux.co.uk/specifications/westfield-london-landscape-digital￾screens).
2. Size of the advertising budget: Some media are naturally more expensive
than others. For example, £500,000 may be enough for a national poster
campaign but woefully inadequate for national television and a multichannel
integrated marketing communications campaign. However, widespread
uptake of digital media has created opportunities for smaller firms that
cannot afford to advertise on national television.
3. Relative cost per opportunity to see: The target audience may be reached
much more cheaply using one medium rather than another. However, the
calculation of opportunity to see (OTS) differs according to media class,
making comparison difficult. For example, in the UK an OTS for the press
is defined as ‘read or looked at any issue of the publication for at least two
minutes’, whereas for posters it is ‘traffic past site’, and online it is the
number of unique visits or downloads. See Table 13.1 for the definitions of
opportunity to see used for traditional media.
4. Competitive activity: The key decision is whether to compete in the same
medium or to seek to dominate an alternative medium. Deciding to compete
in the same medium may be appropriate if it is seen as the most effectiveone by the competition, so that to ignore it would be to hand the competition
a massive communication advantage.
5. Opinions of the retail trade (e.g. supermarket buyers): These may influence
the choice of media class. Advertising expenditure is often used by
salespeople to convince the retail trade to increase shelf space for existing
brands and to stock new brands. Since distribution is a key success factor in
these markets, the views of retailers will be important. For example, if it is
known supermarkets favour television advertising in a certain product
market, the selling impact on the trade of £3 million spent on television may
be viewed as greater than the equivalent spend of 50:50 between television
and the press.
TABLE 13.1 Traditional media: definitions of opportunity to see
Television Presence in room with set switched on, at turn of clock minute, to relevant
channel, provided that presence in room with set on is for at least 15
consecutive seconds
Press Read or looked at any issue (for at least two minutes) within the publication
period (e.g. for weeklies, within the last seven days)
Posters Traffic past site (including pedestrians)
Cinema Actual cinema admissions
Mobile Ad impressions
Digital media options and decisions are covered in Chapter 14.
Media vehicles
Media vehicle refers to the choice of a specific newspaper, magazine,
television slot, poster site location or digital channel. Although creative
considerations still play a part, calculation of cost per thousand exposures is
more important. This requires readership and viewership figures. In the UK,
readership figures are produced by PAMCo – Audience Measurement for
Publishers (https://pamco.co.uk) (formerly the National Readership Survey),
based on surveys with over 22,000 participants per year (PAMCo 2022), while
viewership figures are measured by the Broadcasters’Audience Research
Board (BARB, www.barb.co.uk), which produces daily insight reports based
on household engagement and use of viewing devices (e.g. television,page 519
computer, tablet, mobile). The 7,000 households that make up the panel are
equipped with video-on-demand services connected to Wi-Fi services, to give
a 360-degree view of audience viewing behaviour (BARB 2022). Posters and
other OOH advertising are measured by an organization called Route
(www.route.org.uk), which provides information not only on the number of
people who pass each site, but also on the number of people who are likely to
see a particular site.
A combination of media classes is used in an advertising campaign to take
advantage of the media classes’ relative strengths and weaknesses. For
example, a new car launch might use television to gain awareness and project
the desired image, digital media to foster engagement, press to supply more
technical information, and, later in the campaign, outdoor media such as
posters may be used as a support medium to remind and reinforce earlier
messages.
Execute campaign
Once the advertisements have been produced and the media selected, the
advertisements are shared with relevant media for publication, transmission or
launch online. Careful planning of release dates is required as increased use of
digital channels means reactions to ads is instantaneous. A key organizational
issue is to ensure the right advertisements reach the right media at the right
time. Each media vehicle has its own deadlines after which publication or
transmission may not be possible.
Evaluate advertising effectiveness
All marketing communications, not just advertising, should be evaluated to
determine:
whether the message and the tools that are to be used to deliver the
campaign are likely to be effective
the impact and effectiveness of the campaign once it has been released.
This means pre-testing (before the campaign) and post-testing (during and
after the campaign), and ongoing monitoring throughout. Measurement ofdigital media is discussed in Chapter 14.
What should be measured depends on whatever the advertising is trying to
achieve. As we have already seen, advertising objectives include gaining
awareness, trial, positioning, correcting misconceptions, reminding and
providing support for the sales force (e.g. by identifying ‘warm’ prospects). By
setting targets for each objective, advertising research can assess whether
objectives have been achieved. For example, a campaign might have the
objective of increasing awareness from 10 to 20 per cent, or of raising beliefs
that the product is the ‘best value brand on the market’ from 15 to 25 per cent
of the target consumers. If advertising objectives are couched in sales or
market-share terms, campaign evaluation methods should monitor the sales or
market share effects of the advertising. If trade objectives are important,
distribution and stock levels of wholesalers and/or retailers, and perhaps their
awareness and attitudes, could be measured. Each tool has different methods of
evaluation. In the rest of this section, we focus on advertising research
methods by looking at pre- and post-testing.
Pre-testing
Pre-testing before the campaign is part of the creative process. Adverts can be
tested at various stages of development, from testing the concept to finished
adverts (before they are released). For example:
Concept testing is part of the development of the advertising campaign and
helps the creative team to identify the ideas most likely to be effective. This
method works by showing the target audience a rough outline of the ideas,
for example storyboards or photographs. The advantage is that a variety of
ideas can be tested prior to further development. A limitation of this
approach is it takes place in an artificial setting, and this must be considered
when evaluating the results.
Focus groups – a small number of target audience members are brought
together to discuss ideas and relevant topics. There will be a moderator who
is experienced in interviewing, and who uses the gathering to probe thoughts
and emotions. The advantage is this is a relatively low-cost approach that
can reveal in-depth information about target audience preferences, but the
results can lack objectivity and be potentially biased.
Readability tests are used to test finished print-based adverts. The
comprehensibility of the words used in the copy is tested.page 520
Post-testing
Post-testing is carried out after the release of an advert, and can be used to
assess the advert’s effectiveness throughout a campaign and when it is over.
Checking how well an advertising campaign has performed provides
information for future campaigns. A key advantage of post-testing is that it is
carried out in the ‘live’ environment. Methods of post-testing include:
Inquiry tests – these measure the number of direct enquiries and responses
resulting from the advertising, which may include completed coupons or
requests for more information. This method has become more widely used
with the increase in the use of direct marketing.
Recall tests are designed to measure the impact of adverts on the
target audience. Recall tests usually rely on responses from many
members of the target audience who are interviewed within a short time
after seeing the advert. This form of measurement is reasonably accurate
(e.g. each time an advert is tested, the results are the same). However, the
ability of recall tests to predict sales is generally considered to be low
(bringing the validity of this method into question). Despite these issues,
recall testing is widely used, especially to evaluate television advertising,
and can also be used for press advertisements.
Recognition tests are based on memory and the ability of members of the
target audience to reprocess information in an advert. This is one of the main
methods used to measure magazine readership. The reliability of recognition
tests is high and much better than that of recall tests (Fill 2009, pp.453–9).
Likeability has been found to be a very powerful predictor of sales (Gordon
1992). The problem with likeability is it is difficult to measure. For
example, if one person says ‘I like the advert a lot’ how does this compare
with a person who says ‘I like the advert a little’? For each person the
evaluation will have a different meaning and relevance and will stimulate
different levels of interest.
Financial analysis requires the cost of the resources to be evaluated, which
includes the media spend. This analysis is usually carried out continuously
and acts as an early-warning system if costs are spiralling out of control.
Financial control and accountability of the advertising spend have become
increasingly important in recent years.
In Chapter 14, we discuss digital analytics and other forms of digital
testing that are responding to the changing ways audiences receive
communication methods.Organizing for Campaign Development
There are various options when developing an advertising campaign, and the
choice will be largely dependent on the resources, skills and capabilities of the
firm wishing to develop the campaign. In principle, campaigns may be
developed:
in cooperation with people from the media – for example, advertising copy
may be written by firm staff, but the artwork and layout of the advertisement
may be done by the newspaper or magazine
in-house by the advertising department staffed with copywriters, media
buyers and production personnel
in cooperation with a communication agency – these are larger agencies,
which offer a full service, comprising creative, media planning and buying,
planning and strategy development, market research and production.
Given the growing complexity of communication campaigns and the wider
use of digital media platforms, firms wishing to advertise use a combination of
approaches. Central to the success of any campaign is the relationship between
clients and agencies. However, the communication industry is a ‘people’
business, and therefore it is critically important to get the relationships right to
develop the trust and commitment that will see the campaign through to a
successful conclusion.
Managing the client–agency relationship
Strong relationships between clients (advertisers) and their agencies can
provide the platform for effective advertising. A survey of clients and agencies
focused on those issues that were causing problems in achieving this desired
state (Rauyruen and Miller 2007; Morgan and Hunt 1994). Many clients
demanded agencies become more involved in their business, with comments
like ‘they need to spend more time understanding our challenges and goals’
and ‘they need to take more notice of the client’s view with regard to creative
work’. Clearly, clients were looking for agencies to spend more time and
attention on understanding their business objectives before beginning the
creative process (Curtis 2002a, 2002b).
The importance of the early stages of the advertising development process
was also emphasized by agencies. Some complained about having to deal withpage 521
junior people at the briefing stage, who had not been trained to write a clear
brief. This is critical, because unless clients get the briefing stage right, things
will inevitably go wrong further down the line. This problem was connected to
the lack of accessibility of senior marketing staff because they have too much
other work to do. This means that briefing is left in the hands of junior staff,
who have the power to say ‘no’ but not ‘yes’. This can be very frustrating for
agencies. One agency complained about not enough ‘ear time’ with a senior
member of his client’s marketing team: ‘he is too busy and there is too big an
experience gap between him and his team’. Two further
consequences of this were insufficient access to business
objectives and strategy, and an inability to provide constructive feedback on
their proposals.
One issue that can spoil client–agency relationships is client conflict. This
occurs when an advertising agency wins a new account from a rival to an
existing client, or when an agency is taken over by another that holds the
account of a rival. Both scenarios have happened to Procter & Gamble. Media
planning agency Zenith Optimedia won the L’Oréal account, causing potential
client conflict with its existing Procter & Gamble account. Procter & Gamble
was also concerned when its advertising agency Grey Global was acquired by
the WPP Group, which counts arch-rival Unilever among its client base. Such
situations can end relationships or, as was the case with WPP, the client’s fears
may be assuaged if it is satisfied separate agency networks will be working for
the two clients (Singh 2005).
Research into relationships with web and internet agencies indicates firms
will be more successful if they build long-term, mutually supportive
relationships with their customers. However, to work together, both parties rely
on making agreements that are dependent on high levels of trust and
commitment. Furthermore, the need to understand how to build successful
relationships in highly complex and challenging online trading environments is
not only important but critical for the success of digital campaigns (Vize et al.
2011).
Three key factors are crucial in managing client relationships. First, the
agency should be client-centric. This means understanding the client’s market
and business, and how both are changing. There can be a tendency for such an
understanding to dwindle over time. To combat this, agencies should invite
clients to talk about their business. Second, agencies should not neglect
personal contact. With digital communication the easy option, it can be
tempting to communicate remotely: however, face-to-face contact is crucial asit is difficult to build and maintain a business relationship purely through
email. Finally, the strength of the relationship needs to be checked regularly.
Assuming everything is fine because nobody has complained is a dangerous
path to follow.
Ethical Issues in Advertising
Advertising has an influence on society and subsequent behaviours. There are
many controversial issues and we will discuss some of them now.
Advertising to children and teenagers
Critics argue younger people are especially susceptible to persuasion and
therefore need special protection from advertising. Others claim they are
remarkably streetwise and can look after themselves. Sweeney and colleagues
(2021) found teenagers could be positively disposed towards influencer
marketing online that interests them personally but, equally, critical and
sceptical towards the general practice of this type of marketing.
Nevertheless, there are many regulations controlling advertising to younger
audiences. The UK has a code of practice regulated by the ASA to control
advertisements aimed at all sectors of society – with special rules for children
– which is designed to make sure advertisers avoid the misleading presentation
of product information, or adverts that could cause physical, mental or moral
harm. There are controls on the timing of adverts – for example, a 9 p.m.
watershed was recently introduced to control exposure to adverts for products
with high fat and sugar content, as part of efforts to help tackle childhood
obesity. The placement of adverts is also controlled, which is relevant to OOH
advertising boards. Research has found children’s exposure to OOH adverts
for tobacco placed on bus stops near tobacco retailers was unhealthy for
children using this form of transport to get to and from school; in addition,
sexual imagery cannot be used in adverts placed within 100 metres of a school
(Conway 2022).
Misleading advertisingpage 522
This takes the form of exaggerated claims and concealed facts. For example, it
would be unethical to claim a car achieves 50 miles to the gallon when the
reality is only 30 miles. Nevertheless, most countries accept a certain amount
of ‘puffery’, recognizing consumers are intelligent and interpret the claims in
such a way that they are not deceptive; in the UK, the advertising slogan
‘Carlsberg: probably the best lager in the world’ is acceptable for this reason.
However, in Europe, advertisers should be aware of a European directive on
misleading advertising, which states the burden of proof lies with the
advertiser should the claims be challenged.
Many industrialized countries have their own codes of practice to protect
the consumer from deceptive advertising. The ASA’s code states advertising
should be ‘legal, decent, honest and truthful’. This means advertisers need to
be very careful about the claims they make. For example, supermarket retailer
Waitrose claimed in a television and cinema advert ‘Everyone who works for
Waitrose owns Waitrose.’ However, cleaning services are outsourced, so this
precluded certain workers. The supermarket and the ASA agreed the case
could be closed if Waitrose amended the advert. Electronic cigarette brand VIP
was accused of glamourizing e-cigarettes in its television adverts. This
complaint was upheld, and as a result the ads were banned (ASA 2015).
However, the industry has grown to be worth in excess of £1 billion in the UK,
and e-cigarette manufactures have been accused of developing products that
might encourage children into nicotine addiction – names like Tango Tipple,
Lime Zest and Juicy Pineapple Chunks are likely to suggest a fruity drink to a
child. E-cigarettes are now the most commonly consumed form of nicotine
among children, and research has suggested young adults who try e-cigarettes
are four times more likely to start smoking regularly than those who try
conventional cigarettes (Ungoed-Thomas and Neal 2018).
Advertising’s influence on society’s values
Critics argue advertising images have a profound effect on society. They claim
advertising promotes materialism and takes advantage of human frailties.
Advertising is accused of stressing the importance of material possessions,
such as the ownership of an expensive car or the latest consumer electronics.
Critics argue this promotes the wrong values in society. The ASA takes veryseriously any campaigns that might bring advertising into disrepute. For
example, Paddy Power, an Irish bookmaker, launched a series of adverts
offering incentives to bet on the outcome of the Oscar Pistorius murder trial.
The ASA received 5,525 complaints, which were upheld, as it ruled ‘The ad is
offensive for trivialising the issues surrounding a murder trial, the death of a
woman and disability.’ The ASA also concluded these adverts brought
advertising into disrepute.
Product Placement
Product placement is the deliberate placing of products, services and brand
identifiers (e.g. logos) into media content such as films and television
programmes, usually in return for financial gain (Chen and Haley 2014). This
form of mass communication is sometimes referred to as ‘embedded
marketing’ and can be highly lucrative, as placement opportunities often
command high prices from brand owners. Placements can be particularly
effective if the respective brand is also advertised during the television show or
film. Virtual-reality films and video games have been found to be highly
effective locations for product placement as the viewer becomes immersed in
the content and can interact with elements in the digital environment. In both
situations, the individual has control over what they are viewing and can curate
how they experience the content. Research suggests this form of engagement
can enhance brand exposure and perception, increase interest in and improve
recall of products and services placed within the virtual environment.
Experiences of the brand can be more memorable in virtual settings where the
individual can interact and view products dynamically from different angles. In
traditional media (films and television), brand encounters are more relaxed and
there is no scope for dynamic engagement with the brand (Wang and Chen
2019).
Product placement has been used in the US, UK and Europe for some time,
but there are restrictions and rules around product placement. For example
Ofcom, regulator of communication services in UK, has a legislative code that
regulates the use of product placement and sponsorship for television and
radio. The code has principles and rules covering fairness and privacy: for
example, under-18s are protected from exposure to inappropriate content and
any such items that might injure their physical, mental or moral development.page 523
The code also covers harm and offences, crime, hatred, religion, politics and
impartiality (Ofcom 2022). In the US, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
regulates the use of product placement, and showing brands in media
productions is generally allowed without full disclosure. However, sponsored
content and adverts are required to clearly disclose the relationship between
the content provider and the brand. This is particularly important for social
media influencers. The FTC has contacted celebrities, athletes and a number of
influencers to remind them of their responsibility to clearly show their
relationships with the brands they display in social media. For example,
hashtags and links that include #ad or #partner, for example, at the end of a
long string of tags are not sufficient as viewers may skip over the particulars of
the posting (FTC 2017). In the EU, there is variation in the disclosure
requirements of member countries. Consequently, media
producers, brand marketers and influencers need to carefully
consider the use of product placement.
Despite these complex regulations and disclosure requirements, use of
product placement has grown significantly in recent years. Some of the drivers
include:
media fragmentation, which means it is increasingly hard to reach mass￾market segments using traditional media
the brand can benefit from the positive associations it gains from being in
popular media productions
inconspicuous consumption – many consumers do not realize the brand has
been product-placed
repeat showings or viewings means the brand is seen again and again
careful choice of production
specific targeting – video on demand, film, television and radio allow
particular segments to be reached
promotional and merchandising opportunities can be generated through
associated digital media channels (e.g. websites, social media).
For example, popular UK television soaps Coronation Street, Emmerdale
and EastEnders saw audience figures fall more than 20 per cent in formerly
popular TV slots as viewers moved to watching their favourite programmes
using video on demand (VOD), which means the value of advertising during
the commercial breaks in these shows is dwindling. Commercial TV channels
rely on advertising revenues to fund their operations, so it is important to find
a solution to this growing problem. ITV’s commercial director believesproduct placement is a potential solution, encouraging more brands to see their
products and services integrated into shows in a natural way and creating new
touchpoints to engage consumers. Heineken, for example, introduced its
alcohol-free beer in fictional pubs in these popular soaps (Coronation Street’s
Rover’s Return and Emmerdale’s Woolpack), resulting in greater reach and
frequency of exposure of the brand to the target audience. This approach also
permits products to be viewed in a natural and ‘unskippable’ setting, without
the potential for irritating the end consumer as they view their chosen shows
(Bowler 2022). Coronation Street also has its own branches of Costa Coffee
and the Co-op in its fictional town, Weatherfield. This was the first peak-time
viewing serial to include such extensive brand placement. When aired, such
shows must display a ‘P’ logo to indicate the use of placements (Khomami
2018).
Video games are increasing in popularity as a means of communications
for Gen Zers and, in some cases, are more popular than social media and other
more traditional media channels. In-game ads are increasingly being used to
capture the attention of younger audiences, but these consumers skip ads as
soon as possible, diminishing the potential value of traditional advertising.
Product placement has created viable alternatives for game developers,
enabling brands to appear without interrupting game play. Research has found
over 30 per cent of gamers talk about or want further information on in-game
product exposure, and this translates to additional sales. Popular soft drink
Gatorade’s product placement in sports games has led to an increase in sales
for the brand approaching 24 per cent. This type of product placement also
enables geotargeting, which means smaller regional and local brands can
benefit from using this approach. As technology advances and 5G adoption
becomes more prevalent, opportunities for virtual-reality advertising and
product placement are likely to increase significantly (Shahrbatian 2020).
While product placement is becoming very popular, it is important to
remember there are risks involved. If the film or television show fails to take
off, this can tarnish the image of the brand and reduce its potential exposure.
Even when a film is highly successful, there may still be issues that prevent
brands from wanting to be involved. For example, Danny Boyle, when making
his film Slumdog Millionaire, was not allowed to use Mercedes-Benz products
in a slum setting (Wikipedia 2012), and all images of the brand had to be
removed from the film.
Furthermore, audiences can become annoyed by blatant product placement,
damaging the brand image, and brand owners may not have complete controlpage 524
over how their brand is portrayed. And, because the popularity of product
placement has been quick to grow, this has given rise to claims it constitutes
deceptive advertising. Lobby groups in the US claim one of the difficulties
with product placement is it cannot be controlled by the consumer in the way
traditional advertising breaks can – through ‘zapping’ (switching to another
channel) – and they want it restricted.
However, Coker and Altobello (2018) found the social setting in which
product placements are viewed can have a significant influence on
effectiveness and recall. For instance, if product placement is viewed when a
person is accompanied by friend(s) rather than viewing alone, the shared
experience strengthens recall. Core purified water often appears on screen in
these types of settings, for example in the Netflix show Family Reunion
(Haigney 2022). As more viewing takes place via subscription services such as
Amazon Prime and Netflix, where there is limited opportunity for
traditional adverts to be viewed, the importance of product
placement is likely to increase, and it may even become the ‘primary way
consumers see, hear, and learn about brands’ (Coker and Altobello 2018). This
trend also affects television viewership, albeit in a slightly different way, with
current smart TVs allowing viewers to skip through advertisements using live
pause and recording features.
Product placement is subject to the same kinds of analysis as all the other
promotional techniques described in this chapter. Read Marketing in Action

Product Placement in Film and TV Series
Product placement in media content can take different forms: on the screen, mentioned in
the script or as part of the plot.Source: Retro AdArchives/Alamy Stock Photo
On-screen placement
Brands and services are in the background or used by the characters in the film but are not
explicitly mentioned. This form of placement can work well as viewers enjoy seeing real
products rather than fictitious ones created especially for the movie. Heineken struck a 15-
year multi-picture deal for product placement in the James Bond films. The beer appeared
several times in a short sequence, which included it being handled by James Bond. The
brand paid a reported $45 million for its products to appear in Skyfall, which included a 30-
second commercial and an online game featuring Daniel Craig in the Bond role (Nathanson
2013). The Bond movies are a high-profile franchise and product placement has been used
in these films since the early 1960s. In the 2021 Bond film No Time to Die, which is
reportedly the second most branded film of all time, the top 10 brands appearing in the film
were:
1. Triumph motorcycles
2. LG electronics
3. David Clark headset
4. Omega watches
5. Toyota SUV
6. Microsoft electronics
7. MOSCOT glasses
8. Land Rover SUV
9. Dell electronics
10. Aston Martin cars.
Mentioned in the script
In this type of placement, a character in the film will mention the product, for example lead
character Marty McFly orders a Pepsi in Back to the Future Part II; Zillow, a US online real
estate platform, got mentions in Netflix series such as Grace and Frankie (‘Pretend we’re
listed on Zillow’) and Never Have I Ever (‘I Zillowed his house. Do you want to know what its
Zestimate was?’). This form of product placement can be powerful. For fitness equipment
brand Peloton the impact was dramatic, both artistically and financially: when a character in
US comedy drama And Just Like That had a heart attack while exercising on a Peloton, its
real-world stock market value fell.
Part of the plotpage 525
Nike’s fantasy self-lacing shoes first appeared in Back to the Future Part II and, in 1989, in
2008 it made a version of the shoes that created huge demand for these and future
designer ranges. The Lego Movie series gave a significant and ongoing boost to LEGO
sales. However, The Internship – a movie about working at Google – was deemed a flop.
Google was not paid for it, but retained control of the creative content, and this was argued
to have stifled the creative development and overall impact of the film.

Public Relations and Sponsorship
In a 365-day, 24/7 interconnected global society, every move a firm makes can
be shared. Intended and unintended messages about a product, brand or firm
can appear in a variety of media. This means corporate reputation is constantly
in the spotlight, and this change in emphasis has meant a rise in the importance
of public relations (PR). The role of digital media in PR is discussed in
Chapter 14.
A firm is dependent on many groups if it is to be successful. The marketing
concept focuses on customers and distributors, but the needs and interests of
other groups, such as employees, shareholders, the local community, the
media, government and pressure groups, are also important. PR is concerned
with all of these groups and may be defined as ‘the management of
communications and relationships to establish goodwill and mutual
understanding between an organization and its public’.
PR is therefore wider ranging than marketing, and involves communicating
with groups (‘publics’) and building relationships that have emotional value
for all participants (Zhang and Adegbola 2022). These publics are shown in
Figure 13.5.
FIGURE 13.5
An organization and its publicspage 526
PR activities include media relations, lobbying, corporate advertising,
crisis management, social media management and sponsorship. PR can
accomplish many objectives, as outlined below (Lesly 1998; Zhang and
Adegbola 2022):
Prestige and reputation: it can foster prestige and reputation, which can help
firms to sell products, attract and keep good employees, and promote
favourable community and government relations.
Promotion of products: the desire to buy a product can be enhanced by the
unobtrusive things people read and see online, in the press, and on radio and
television. Awareness of and interest in products and firms can be generated.
Dealing with issues and opportunities: the ability to handle social and
environmental issues to the mutual benefit of all parties involved.
Goodwill of customers: ensuring customers are presented with useful
information, are treated well, and have their complaints dealt with fairly and
speedily.
Goodwill of employees: promoting the sense of identification and
satisfaction of employees with their firm; activities such as internal
newsletters, recreation activities, and awards for service and achievement
can be used.Overcoming misconceptions: managing misconceptions about a firm to
ensure unfounded opinions do not damage its operations.
Goodwill of suppliers and distributors: building a reputation as a good
customer (for suppliers) and a reliable supplier (for distributors).
Goodwill of government: influencing the opinions of public officials and
politicians so they think the firm operates in the public interest.
Dealing with unfavourable press coverage: responding quickly, accurately
and effectively to negative publicity such as that involving an oil spill or an
air disaster.
Attracting and keeping good employees: creating and maintaining
respectability in the eyes of the public so the best personnel are attracted to
work for the firm.
PR can take the form of two basic models. In the first, communication
messages flow one way, for example a firm’s press agent produces favourable
information in the form of press releases and media events. A variation of this
approach is to disseminate information that presents a more balanced view
(including positive and negative information). This is sometimes referred to as
a public information model (Fill 2009, p.55).
The second model focuses on two-way communications, so feedback from
target audiences is paramount. There are a further two derivatives of this
model:
Two-way asymmetric: In this model, power is not equally distributed
between the stakeholders and the organization. The purpose of this form of
PR is to influence attitudes and behaviour through persuasion (Fill 2009,
p.256).
Two-way symmetric: This model aims to be mutually rewarding, as power is
dispersed equally between the organization and its stakeholders.
Communication flow is reciprocal. Some organizations use PR as a means
of mediating relationships between the organization and its various
stakeholders.
In the highly connected multichannel media world it is difficult to isolate
the various forms of PR, which means there is a tendency for different models
to coexist (Grunig 1997). The remainder of this section on PR examines
different methods and techniques, focusing, in particular, on media relations
and sponsorship.page 527
Media relations
A major element of PR is media relations, which includes press and social
media releases, press conferences and interviews, and publicity. Media
relations can be defined as communication about a product or organization by
placing news about it in the media without paying for the time or space
directly.
The key tasks of a media relations department are:
responding to requests from the media – although a passive service function,
it requires well-organized information and prompt responses to media
requests
supplying the media with information on events and occurrences relevant to
the organization – this requires general internal communication channels
and knowledge of the media
stimulating the media to carry the information and viewpoint of the
organization – this requires creative development of ideas, developing close
relationships with media people, and understanding their needs and
motivations.
Characteristics of media relations
Information dissemination may be through the web, news releases, news
conferences, interviews, feature articles, photo calls and public speaking (at
conferences and seminars, for example). No matter which method is used to
carry the information, media relations has five important characteristics:
1. The message has high credibility: The message has higher credibility than
advertising, because it appears to the reader to have been written
independently (by a media person) rather than by an advertiser.
2. No direct media costs: Since space or time in the media is not bought, there
is no direct media cost: however, this is not to say it is cost-free. Content
must be written, the news release posted, representatives of a firm or a brand
are needed to take part in the interview or organize the news conference.
This may be organized internally, by a press officer or media relations
department, or externally, by a PR agency.
3. Loss of control of publication: Unlike advertising, there is no guarantee the
news item will be published. This decision is taken out of the control of the
organization and into the hands of an editor. A key factor in thisdecision is whether the item is judged to be newsworthy (Table 13.2 lists
several potentially newsworthy topics).
4. Loss of control of content: There is no way of ensuring the viewpoint
expressed by the news supplier is reflected in the published article. For
example, a news release might point to an increase in capital expenditure to
deal with pollution, but this information might be used in a negative way
(e.g. saying the increase is inadequate).
5. Loss of control of timing: An advertising campaign can be coordinated to
achieve maximum impact. The timing of the publication of news items,
however, cannot be controlled. For example, a news item publicizing a
forthcoming conference to encourage attendance could appear in a
publication after the event has taken place or too late to have any practical
effect on attendance.

Crisis management and social media
It is important to manage challenging and controversial issues; if this is not
done effectively a firm’s reputation can be damaged. PR practitioners
constantly review a firm’s activities, its marketing environment and that of its
publics, looking for issues that may need to be controlled as they could have a
detrimental impact. Crisis situations can occur from different sources. For
example:
Environmental issues: Volkswagen and Audi were accused of manipulating
engine emissions to pass tests. Inconsistent statements from the vehicle
manufacturers, senior management denials, promises of compensation for
customers, and ineffective use of social media led to a negative backlash,
angry customers and loss of environmental credibility, which impacted on
both brands (Joshi and Hakim 2016).
Natural disasters: When Amazon’s warehouse in Edwardville, Illinois, US,
collapsed because of a tornado and employees were killed, founder Jeff
Bezos received criticism for not responding quickly enough with his
statement to the firm’s employees. However, chief logistics officer Dave
Clark responded immediately on behalf of the firm, issuing a statement
directed to the bereaved families. Nevertheless, this did not stop other
employment-related issues resurfacing in the media, resulting in the
exposure of negative factors relating to the brand (Maerowitz 2021).page 528
Organizational failures and employment issues: P&O Ferries unexpectedly
announced on social media that it could not run its ferries on 17 March
2022, apologizing to customers for any inconvenience. The message was
interpreted by many as meaning the firm was entering liquidation, and
rumours spread rapidly across media channels. In fact, the firm was getting
rid of 800 members of its workforce and replacing them with cheaper
employees. These events triggered a PR disaster: the ferry firm
communicated badly with all of its publics, did not properly explain the
situation, and, as a result, suffered significant reputational and business
damage both on- and offline (Simpson 2022).
Social media has become pivotal in crisis communications and an
important source of information. Its relevance has increased when identifying
and managing a crisis (Chon and Kim 2022). Social media has become a
platform for communication in a crisis, as demonstrated in the
aforementioned P&O case. Social media platforms involve
publics as soon as as an event happens, and enable discussion and public
debate to ensue. This can add pressure to the crisis-management team who are
attempting to manage the situation (Bukar et al. 2021).
For marketers, the effective management of a PR crisis is important. Bundy
et al. (2016) suggest an integrated approach, considering internal and external
perspectives at three key stages: pre-crisis, during crisis management and post￾crisis outcomes. Based on their work, Figure 13.6 highlights the stages in a
crisis-management situation and suggests the actions a firm should take to
avoid negative outcomes.
Pre-crisis prevention: Firms should organize internally to ensure their
culture, management leadership, structures and systems are designed to
avoid crisis, and to ensure the firm can respond to its publics and customers
in a manner that shows it to be reliable. Achieving a level of preparedness
and regularly looking at potential risks has been found to build stronger
external stakeholder relationships (Bundy et al. 2016).
Crisis management: Leadership is key and the approach taken towards a
crisis situation can result in different outcomes. Leaders who become
emotionally involved in a situation limit their options, and are less open￾minded and flexible than those who remain more objective (James and
Wooten 2010). Internally, governance of corporate communications should
seek to communicate and take action to manage the firm’s image. This can
also involve employees, who can become defenders (or not) of a firm
(Johansen et al. 2012). Crisis-response strategies should seek to improvestakeholder perceptions of the firm. Strategies may be on a continuum from
defensive (firm accepts less responsibility for the crisis situation) to
accommodating (firm accepts more responsibility, apologizes and takes
corrective action) (Bundy et al. 2016).
Post-crisis resolution and recovery: Firms should learn from a crisis￾management situation so they can move on and create opportunities to
develop competitive advantage out of rectifying the crisis situation.
Learning should also seek to ensure crises are prevented in future (Madsen
2009). Social evaluation means looking at the external outcomes, and
assessing the firm’s reputation and legitimacy following the crisis event.

Sponsorship
Sponsorship has been defined as ‘a business relationship between a provider
of funds, resources or services and an individual, event or organization which
offers in return some rights and association that may be used for commercial
advantage’ (Sleight 1989).
According to Cuesta-Valino and colleagues (2022), there are three key
roles to consider when looking at sponsorships, and each has a different part to
play.page 529
1. The sponsor, who provided financial support, funding, knowledge and
experience. Potential sponsors have a wide range of entities to choose from,
including sports, arts, culture, community activities, teams, tournaments,
individual personalities or events, competitions, fairs and shows. The list of
opportunities is endless.
2. The sponsored entity (person, firm), bringing value through image
and reputation and creating the opportunity to link with the
sponsor. Sports sponsorship is particularly popular, as it can offer high
visibility through extensive media coverage, has the ability to attract a broad
cross-section of the community and to service specific niches, and the
capacity to break down cultural barriers.
3. The consumer – this is intangible as the consumer’s role is to perceive both
sponsor and sponsoring organization in a positive manner, and respect the
linkage.
Sponsorship can achieve several communicational objectives. Cinch
(Constellations Automotive Group), for instance, is an online marketplace for
used cars operating across Europe. It invests in many sports sponsorship deals
(e.g. England Cricket, Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, the Lawn Tennis
Association) as well as music festivals (see Exhibit 13.6) and the British Motor
Show. The objective of these sponsorship deals is to raise awareness of the
brand to its multiple publics and consumers (Kirwan 2021).
EXHIBIT 13.6

Sponsored events provide an ideal opportunity to promote firm brands.
Sweatshirts, bags, pens, and so on, carrying the firm’s logo and the name of the
event can be sold to a captive audience. Where the brand can be consumed
during the event (e.g. Nestlé at the Cannes Film Festival), this provides an
opportunity for customers to sample it. Sponsorship can also improve the
effectiveness of other promotional vehicles. For example, responses to direct
marketing materials issued by the Visa credit card organization and featuring
its sponsorship of the Olympic Games were 17 per cent higher than responses
from a control group to which the sponsorship images were not transmitted
(Crowley 1991).
Firms should be clear about their reasons for spending money on
sponsorship as there are risks, things can go wrong and the relationship with
the sponsored entity can change over time. For example, tennis sport star
Novak Djokovic had long-term sponsorship deals with Peugeot (cars), Lacoste
and Asics (sportswear), Kronos (software), Hublot (watches) and many others,
but a mix-up over visa entry to Australia and the decision of the world’s
number-one tennis player to remain unvaccinated against Covid-19 impacted
on some of these sponsorship relations, meaning some deals were not renewed
(Zagoria 2022).
The four principal objectives of sponsorship are to: gain publicity, create
entertainment opportunities, improve community relations and createpage 530
promotional opportunities.
Increasing brand awareness by gaining publicity
Sponsorship provides ample opportunity to create publicity in the news media.
Worldwide events such as major golf, football and tennis tournaments supply
the platform for global media coverage. Sponsorship of such events can
provide brand exposure to millions of people. Some events, such as athletics
championships, have mass audience appeal, while others, such as golf, have a
more upmarket profile. Rolex supports many different sporting events around
the world, exposing the brand name to its more upmarket customer segment.
The brand also supports arts and culture, architecture, science and exploration,
as well as education awards for enterprise and mentoring (Rolex 2022).
Budweiser’s sponsorship of England’s FA Cup has given it exposure to the
young male demographic, but it also became the first beer to sponsor the US
National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) (Anheuser-Busch 2019). Many
firms sponsor large events such as the Olympic Games – for example, Tokyo
2020 sponsors included Shimizu Corporation (official sponsor), Coca-Cola,
AOKI Holdings Inc. and Proctor & Gamble, as such events give brands global
exposure.
The publicity opportunities of sponsorship can produce major awareness
shifts – for example, Etihad Airways, Lavazza, Maybelline and Toni & Guy
were among the sponsors of London Fashion Week in 2018. Backed by the UK
Department for International Trade, the aim of this event is to promote the
prominent role of the London fashion industry globally. Brands carefully select
organizations to sponsor that align with their values, such as WWF
(environment), European Red Cross (social responsibility) and the Canon
Foundation (education).
Sponsorship can also be used to position brands in the marketplace (see
Mini Case 13.1).
MINI CASE 13.1
What do Sharp Electronics, Vodafone, Chevrolet andTeamViewer have in Common?
Manchester United Football Club (MUFC) has a long history of Premiership football and is
reported to be among the top-earning clubs in the world, with an annual income of around
£500 million. During the last decade, it has become a brand with global recognition, making
it a potentially attractive sponsorship proposition for firms prepared to offer financial
investment, for example in the club’s ground at Old Trafford in Manchester or in the team’s
kit. Sharp Electronics was the first firm to invest around £0.5 million in MUFC kit in 1982, a
partnership that lasted 17 years. Vodafone replaced Sharp in 1999, making an investment
of £36 million. Then, in 2012, Chevrolet put together a seven-year deal worth more than
£362 million. TeamViewer took over in 2021, with a five-year deal worth £235 million. Why
are firms prepared to invest such significant sums in MUFC and why does the size of deals
change?
Source: Winds/Shutterstock
First, MUFC embodies several values that could be transferred to sponsors, for example
sporting achievement, winning, energy, masculinity. These were values shared by previous
shirt sponsor Chevrolet, a US car brand looking for opportunities to build its global
presence.
MUFC is an interesting sponsorship partner – it is a point of entry into not only the UK
domestic market, as the club also has strong international connections. Its global fan base
numbers over 700 million, more than half of whom live in emerging markets in China and
other parts of Asia, making it one of the world’s most popular football clubs.
When the partnership with shirt sponsor Chevrolet was announced in 2012, more than 1
billion page impressions were downloaded from the car manufacturer’s website within two
weeks. This news and subsequent online activity exceeded previous (similar scale)
marketing campaigns by Chevrolet focused on the US Super Bowl, making this a valuable
communication and brand awareness campaign.
In 2021, TeamViewer took over the club shirt sponsorship, paying less than Chevrolet to
expand its brand positioning and market its products. MUFC claims to have more than 1.1
billion fans and followers, who will be exposed to the TeamViewer logo on its players’ shirts.
Others partnering with MUFC have included: Kohler Co (principal global partner), raising
awareness for its ‘Safe Water For All’ initiative through its brand exposure with MUFC fans;page 531
DHL (logistics partner); open-source blockchain Tezos (training kit partner); Adidas (official
supplier of the team’s football kit); and Cadbury (partner).
Questions:
1. Explain what should be considered when selecting a sponsor.
2. Identify and discuss what to offer potential sponsors to encourage their support and
funding.
3. Select a leading European football team, identify its main sponsors, and then
suggest the benefits of the partnership to both sponsor and team.

(2015); Manutd.com (2018, 2022); Sky Sports (2021)
Reinforcing brand values and image
A major objective of much sponsorship is to build relationships, and this can
be achieved by improving customer perceptions of brand values. Popular
brands can have enduring images in the minds of individuals, and sponsorship
can be used to reinforce and change these images. When Burger King
sponsored Stevenage Football Club, an English Football League Two team, it
was looking to engage the local community and reinforce brand values. In its
first campaign event, fans could compete to win a Whopper or Chicken Fries
by completing online challenges and sharing them on social media. It
was one short campaign, but it received 1.2 million impressions
online. Burger King saw this as a success and extended the partnership to
sponsor the Stevenage women’s football team, creating a new Burger Queen
logo for their shirts. It also rebranded the Burger King store in the town as
Burger Queen (Stevenage FC 2019).
Sponsorship creates entertainment opportunities for customers and the
trade. Sponsorship of music, the performing arts and sports events can be
particularly effective. For example, Rolex supports classical concerts and the
arts (e.g. the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra’s New Year’s concert and Royal
Opera House in London). Waitrose sponsored the England Cricket Team.
Often, sports personalities are invited to join the sponsor’s guests. Attendance
at sponsored events can also be used to reward successful employees.
Figure 13.7 shows some broad values conferred on the sponsor from five
sponsorship categories. These are composite views. Values may depend on a
specific activity or event – for example, football versus tennis.FIGURE 13.7
Values transferred from sponsorship categories
Based on: Meenaghan and Shipley (1999)
Enhancing brand image through improving community relations
Sponsorship of schools (e.g. by providing low-cost personal computers) and
supporting community programmes can foster a socially responsible, caring
reputation for a firm. For example, the Lloyds Bank Social Entrepreneurs
programme sponsors young adults in community and environmental projects,page 532
while Levi’s became an official sponsor of Liverpool Football Club. Both
brands focus on developing a long-term partnership that can give added value
for football fans through music and art. The Levi’s music project provides
local young adults with the opportunity to develop creative talents in the arts,
and aims to enhance the community and people’s lifestyles (Liverpool FC
2018).
Selection and evaluation of an event or programme to sponsor
Selection of an event or programme to sponsor should be undertaken by
answering a series of questions.
Communications objectives: What are we trying to achieve? Are we looking
for awareness or image, improvement in community relations or
entertainment opportunities? Does the personality of the event match the
desired brand image?
Target market: Who are we trying to reach? Is it the trade or final
customers? How does the profile of our customer base match the likely
audience of the sponsored event or programme?
Risk: What are the associated risks? What are the chances the event or
programme might attract adverse publicity (e.g. football hooliganism
tainting the image of the sport and, by implication, the sponsor)? To what
extent would termination of the sponsorship contract attract bad publicity
(e.g. mean the closing of a theatre)?
Promotional opportunities: What are the potential sales promotion and
publicity opportunities?
Past record: If the event or programme has been sponsored before, what
were the results? Why did the previous sponsor withdraw?
Cost: Does the sponsorship opportunity represent value for money?
The evaluation process should lead to a clear idea of why an event or
programme is being sponsored. Understanding sponsorship objectives is the
first step in evaluating sponsorship’s success. For major sponsorship deals,
evaluation is likely to be more formal and involve the measurement of media
coverage and name mentions/sightings using a specialist monitoring agency.Sales Promotion
Sales promotions are incentives to consumers or the trade that are designed to
stimulate purchase. Examples include money off and free gifts (consumer
promotions), discounts and sales force competitions (trade promotions).
Sales promotions have become increasingly important as means of
incentivizing customers and to counter market erosion caused by mass
customization and product commoditization. Firms typically spend 20 per cent
of their promotional budgets on sales promotions to drive sales (Chaudhuri et
al. 2018).
The effects of sales promotion
Sales promotions are used as a short-term tactical device to elicit a response
from the target audience and influence consumers’ (and firms’) purchasing
behaviour, and increase impulse buying (unplanned, sudden or immediate
purchases), which is significant in consumer markets around the world
(Bandyopadhyaya et al. 2021). Sales promotions can also be effective when
launching new products in competitive markets, act as an incentive to motivate
trial (Hooley et al. 2005), boost sales during the promotional period because of
the incentive effect, and are an important tool for matching supply and demand
(Demirag et al. 2011). Promotions can result in a fall in sales after a campaign,
as customers have stocked up on the product at the reduced price. The long￾term sales effect of the promotion could be positive, neutral or negative. Buil
and colleagues (2013) found the effect of sales promotions on brand equity
varies depending on the type of promotion. Monetary offers (price discounts)
can negatively affect perception of quality, whereas gifts can have a positive
effect and increase brand associations. Marketing managers should consider
carefully when to give price incentives, as extended use of this approach is
likely to damage the perceived quality of a brand in the longer term.
Major sales promotion types
Sales promotions can be directed at the consumer or the trade. Benefits take
the form of immediate or delayed rewards, involving monetary or non￾monetary benefits, giving four broad categories of sales promotions
(Bandyopadhyaya et al. 2021). The major immediate-reward sales promotionare money off, bonus packs, premiums and free gifts/samples. Delayed-reward
promotions include coupons, prize promotions, cashback offers and loyalty
cards. A sizeable proportion of sales promotions are directed at the trade,
including price incentives and discounts, free goods, competitions, allowances,
promotional price support, and in-store display and promotional support,
which then filter through the supply chain towards the end consumer. Shoppers
can be motivated by the pursuit of hedonic pleasures and value seeking, and
sales promotions can be applied to satisfy these desires, especially when
shoppers are bargain seekers (Nguyen et al. 2007).
Figure 13.8 illustrates the different types of sales promotion.
FIGURE 13.8
Consumer and trade promotions
Consumer promotions
The following sections examine the main types of consumer promotions.page 533
Money off Money-off promotions provide direct value to the customer
and are therefore an unambiguous incentive to purchase. They have a proven
track record of stimulating short-term sales increases and encouraging trial
(Bandyopadhyaya et al. 2021). However, price reductions can easily be
matched by the competition and if used frequently can devalue brand image.
Consumer response may be ‘If the brand is that good, why do they need to
keep reducing the price?’A variant on the normal money-off promotion is the
value pack. With value packs, the consumer pays a higher price for the larger
pack, but the per-unit price (e.g. per gram or per tablet) is less.
Bonus packs These offer added value by giving consumers extra quantity
at no additional cost. Bonus packs are often used in the drinks, confectionery
and detergent markets. For example, cans of lager may be sold based on ‘12.5
per cent extra free’. Because the price is not lowered, this form of promotion
runs less risk of devaluing brand image – extra value is given by raising
quantity rather than cutting price. With some product groups, this encourages
buyers to consume more. For example, a chocolate bar will be eaten or a can
of lager drunk whether there is extra quantity or not.
Premiums Premiums are any merchandise offered free or at low cost as
an incentive to purchase a brand. There are four major forms of premiums,
which can offer both immediate or delayed benefit: free in- or on-pack gifts,
free in-the-mail offers, self-liquidating offers, and buy-one-get-one-free offers
(e.g. Domino’s ‘buy one get one free’ offers). There are websites built around
directing shoppers to the latest deals and free stuff. Savethestudent.org, for
example, helps students find the best bank accounts, broadband, gadgets and
free gifts, from a free roll and hot drink at Greggs bakery to free ice cream at
TGI Friday’s restaurants.
FMCG manufacturer brands use premiums to promote sales. This
technique is widely used in the cosmetics industry as an incentive to purchase
more high-priced items. Clinique, Estée Lauder and L’Occitane frequently
have offers that provide free gifts when the customer spends over a certain
amount of money. Occasionally, the gift is a free sample of one brand banded
to another brand (branded pack offer). The free sample may be a new variety
or flavour that benefits by getting trial. However, firms should carefully
consider brand alliances, as the bundling of brands does not necessarily help. Ifpage 534
one brand is weaker than the other paired in a sales promotion bundle, research
has shown this to have a detrimental effect. Only when brands of comparable
strength are joined are benefits gained (Vaidyanathan and Aggarwal 2022).
This type of promotion is also often used by service providers, and by
leisure and entertainment brands in the form of a delayed benefit (see Exhibit
13.7).

When two or more items are banded together, the promotion is called a
multibuy and can involve a number of items of the same brand being offered
together. Multibuys are a popular form of promotion. They are frequently used
to protect market share by encouraging consumers to stock up on a particular
brand when two or more items of the same brand are packaged together.
However, unlike price reductions, they do not encourage trial because
consumers do not bulk-buy a brand they have not tried before. When
multibuys take the form of two different brands, range trial can be generated.For example, a manufacturer of a branded coffee launching a new brand of tea
could band the two brands together, and thus leverage the strength of the
coffee brand to gain trial of the new tea brand (Killigran and Cook 1999).
Free in-the-mail offers involve the collection of packet tops or labels,
which are sent in the mail as proof of purchase to claim a free gift or money￾off voucher. Kellogg’s Fruit ’n Fibre, for example, has been promoted using
such an offer.
Gifts can be quite valuable, because redemption rates can be low (less than
10 per cent redemption is not unusual). This is because of slippage, which is
when consumers collect labels with a view to mailing them but never collect
the requisite number.
Self-liquidating offers are similar to free in-the-mail offers except
consumers are asked to pay to cover the costs of the merchandise plus
administration and postage charges. The consumer benefits by getting the
goods at below normal cost because the manufacturer passes on the advantage
of bulk buying and prices at cost. The manufacturer benefits by the self￾funding nature of the promotion, although there is a danger of being left with
surplus stocks of the merchandise.
Buy-one-get-one-free offers – sometimes known as BOGOFs: with this
type of promotion the consumer is, in effect, getting two items for the price of
one. Wine is sometimes offered in a BOGOF promotion so the consumer can
buy two bottles of a particular brand for the price of one. The danger of
running BOGOF promotions for heavily advertised brands is they lose their
premium positioning and are seen as just another brand available in bulk at
discount prices (Ritson 2005).
Free samples Free samples of a brand may be delivered to the home or
given out in a store. The idea is, having tried the sample, a proportion of
consumers will begin to buy it. For new brands or brand extensions (e.g. a new
shampoo or fabric conditioner), this form of promotion is an effective if
expensive way of gaining consumer trial. However, sampling may be
ineffective if the brand has nothing extra to offer the consumer, but there may
be other incentives a brand may add for free. For existing brands that have a
low trial but high purchasing rate, sampling may be effective. As many of
those who try the brand like it and buy it again, raising the trial rate through
free samples could have a beneficial long-term effect.page 535
Coupons Coupons can be found online, delivered to the home, appear in
magazines or newspapers, or appear on packs. Home couponing, after home
sampling, can be a good way to achieve trial for new brands (Davidson 2003).
Magazine or newspaper couponing is much cheaper than home delivery and
can be used to stimulate trial, but redemption rates are much lower at around 5
per cent on average. The purpose of on-pack couponing is to encourage initial
and repeat purchasing of the same brand or trial of a different brand.
Redemption rate is high, averaging around 40 per cent (Cummins and Mullin
2008). The coupon can offer a higher face value than the equivalent cost of a
money-off pack, since the effect of the coupon is on both initial and repeat
sales. However, a coupon is usually less effective than money off in raising
initial sales because there is no immediate saving and its appeal is almost
exclusively to existing consumers (Davidson 2003).
Prize promotions There are three main types of prize promotion:
competitions, draws and games. Unlike other promotions, the cost can be
established in advance and does not depend on the number of participants.
Competitions require participants to exercise a certain degree of skill and
judgement. For example, a competition to win free cinema seats might require
entrants to name five films based upon stills from each. Entry is usually
dependent on at least one purchase. Compared with premiums and money off,
competitions offer a less immediate incentive to buy, and one that requires
time and effort on the part of entrants. However, competitions can attract
attention and arouse interest in a brand.
Draws make no demands on skill or judgement – the result depends on
chance. For example, a supermarket may run an out-of-the-hat draw in which
customers fill in their name and address on an entry card and on a certain day a
draw is made. Another example of a draw is when direct mail recipients are
asked to return a card on which there is a set of numbers. This is then
compared against a set of winning numbers.
The national laws governing sales promotions in Europe vary
tremendously, and local legal advice should be taken before implementing a
sales promotion. The UK, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Russia and the
Czech Republic have relaxed laws about what can be done. Germany,
Luxembourg, Austria, Norway, Switzerland and Sweden are much morerestrictive. For example, in Sweden, free mail-ins, free draws and money-off￾next-purchase promotions are not allowed, and in Norway self-liquidating
offers, free draws, money-off vouchers and money-off-next-purchase are not
allowed (PromoWatch 2012).
Loyalty cards While many promotions cut prices or add value in other
ways to act as an incentive to drive sales, loyalty cards offer additional value
by building longer-term customer relationships. Offering promotions via
loyalty or reward schemes can act not only as a trigger for purchase but also as
motivation to switch brands (Cuddeford-Jones 2014). Tesco was the first
national retailer in the UK to introduce a supermarket loyalty scheme and,
since its inception, the scheme has proved popular and rewarding for the
retailer. Several relaunches of Tesco’s Clubcard scheme over the years have
enabled the supermarket brand to keep in touch with customer needs and focus
on certain aspects of its retail offer. For example, a recent change to the card
and links with an app focused on everyday low price (EDLP) items, with
shoppers needing to have the loyalty card in order to benefit from the
discounts on EDLP ranges. This sparked 2.5 million additional users to register
for the loyalty card app, and contributed to increase sales and profits. There are
now more than 20 million households registered as Clubcard users (Hegarty
2021).
Trade promotions
We will now look at trade promotions.
Price discounts The trade may be offered (or may demand) discounts in
return for purchase. The concentration of buying into fewer trade outlets has
placed increasing power with these organizations. This power is often
translated into discounts from manufacturers. The discount may be part of a
joint promotion, whereby the retailer agrees to devote extra shelf space, buy
larger quantities, engage in a joint competition and/or allow in-store
demonstrations. Volume discounts are given to retailers hitting sales targets
(Quilter 2005).
Free goods An alternative to a price discount is to offer more merchandise
at the same price. For example, the baker’s dozen technique involves offering
13 items (or cases) for the price of 12.Competitions A competition may involve a manufacturer offering
financial inducements or prizes to distributors’ sales forces in return for them
achieving sales targets for the manufacturer’s products. Alternatively, a prize
may be given to the sales force with the best sales figures. Procter & Gamble,
a manufacturer of many FMCG products, has evolved the prize concept into an
ongoing promotional programme. Its Good Everyday rewards scheme involves
60 brands, and consumers can sign up to do quizzes, surveys and earn points
that can be redeemed; at the same time, P&G makes donations to causes such
as #endperiodpoverty and the Children’s Safe Clean Drinking Water Program,
as well as supporting education projects (P&G 2022).
Allowances A manufacturer may offer an allowance (a sum of money) in
return for retailers providing promotional facilities in-store (display
allowance). For example, an allowance would be needed to persuade a
supermarket to display cards on its shelves to indicate a brand is being sold at
a special low price. An advertising allowance would be paid by a manufacturer
to a retailer for featuring its brands in the retailer’s advertising. Listing
allowances are paid by the manufacturer to have a brand stocked.
Promotional price support Promotional price support occurs when the
manufacturer/supplier of particular goods or services works with the retailer to
give money-off deals. For example, HSBC Bank had an introductory offer for
its customers, offering a £50 wine voucher to spend with Laithwaites Wine.
This technique is often used by manufacturers and retailers.
In-store display, online and promotional support Another form of
trade promotion is when the manufacturer pays for in-store displays and
advertising and promotional materials. For example, a supplier could pay for a
gondola-end display, a 10-second advertisement on the retailer’s in-store
television network or create a high-profile national multimedia campaign to
support the roll-out of a new product. Old Spice has gone one step further with
its campaign inspired by 1980s action films, with ads resurrecting movie stars
from that decade, such as Dolph Lundgren, using deepfake technology to show
these heroes in action on video, in-store and online, with the hashtag
#smellreadyforanything, to promote the brand (Koltun 2022). Deepfake
technology uses AI to create fictional photos, images, audio clones and events
(Sample 2020).page 536
Sales promotion objectives
The most basic objective of any sales promotion is to provide extra value that
encourages purchase. When targeted at consumers, the intention is to stimulate
consumer pull; when the trade is targeted, distribution push is the objective.
We will now look at specific sales promotion objectives.
Fast sales boost
Sales promotions deliver short-term sales increases and instigate impulse
purchasing, which may be required for a number of reasons: needing to reduce
inventories or meet budgets prior to the end of the financial year, moving old
stocks or increasing stockholding by distributors in advance of the launch of a
competitor’s product (Cummins and Mullin 2008). Promotions providing large
immediate benefits, such as money off or bonus packs, have bigger effects on
sales volume than more distant promotions such as competitions or self￾liquidators. However, whatever the objective for the sales promotion, it should
not be used as a means of patching up more fundamental inadequacies such as
inferior product performance or poor positioning.
A classic sales promotion that went seriously wrong was Hoover’s attempt
in 1992 to boost sales of its washing machines, vacuum cleaners, refrigerators
and tumble driers by offering two free US flight tickets for every Hoover
product purchased over £100. The firm was the target of much bad publicity as
buyers discovered the offer was wreathed in difficult conditions (found in the
promotion’s small print) and complained bitterly to Hoover and the media. In
an attempt to limit the damage done to its reputation, the firm announced it
would honour its offer to its customers, at an estimated cost of £20 million.
Build long-term customer relationships
FMCG manufacturers build long-term relationships with members of their
supply chains, wholesalers and retailers by offering regular discount packages
to encourage purchasing. Spending on this type of promotional incentive has
increased in recent years. The pandemic, changing economic circumstances
and inflation have all impacted on consumers, who are increasingly searchingfor value for money. Regular discounts and promotional offers can help to
maintain customer loyalty and build relationships across the supply chain, and
estimates suggest around US$1 trillion is spent globally each year on
providing trade promotions (Nielsen 2022).
Encourage trial
Sales promotions can be highly successful in encouraging trial. If new buyers
like the brand, the long-term effect of the promotion may be positive.
Sampling and couponing are particularly effective methods of inducing trial.
Promotions that simply give more product (e.g. bonus packs) are likely to be
less successful, since consumers will not place much value on the extra
quantity until they have decided they like the product.
Encourage repeat purchase
Certain promotions, by their nature, encourage repeat purchase of a brand over
a period. Any offer requiring the collection of packet tops or labels (e.g. free
mail-ins and promotions such as bingo games) is attempting to raise repeat
purchases during the promotional period. Loyalty cards are designed to offer
consumers an incentive to repeat purchase at a store.
Stimulate purchase of larger or more expensive packs
Promotions that are specifically linked to larger pack sizes may persuade
consumers to switch from less economical smaller packs. However, there has
been a trend within the FMCG market for more concentrated products that
come in smaller packages and are more expensive but last longer and give
better value for money (e.g. Ecover’s 40 washes and Fairy (Liquid) Max
Power concentrated products, which last longer). Even own-label value brands
offer concentrated versions of their products (e.g. Lidl’s W5 Platinum, Tesco
Value Bio Concentrated Liquid Wash).
Gain distribution and shelf space
Trade promotions are designed to gain distribution and shelf space. These are
major promotional objectives, since there is a strong relationship between sales
and these two factors. Discounts, free gifts and joint promotions are methods
used to encourage distributors to stock brands. Also, consumer promotionspage 537
page 538
provide sizeable extra value, which may persuade distributors to stock
products or give extra shelf space to them.
Traditionally, sales promotions have been associated with achieving
objectives for supermarket brands. However, their presence has spread to other
sectors such as financial services, cars, IT and telecoms.
Evaluating sales promotion
The problem for marketers lies in determining the effectiveness of a particular
advertising technique in increasing sales, maximizing the efficiency of ad
spend and reducing the sales performance gap (the difference between actual
and optimal performance). Research has shown careful monitoring of sales
promotions is needed to avoid negative impacts on consumer spending (Spotts
et al. 2022). There are different ways to evaluate sales promotions, including
return on investment, analysing sales volume, monitoring market
cannibalization, and past customer engagement. Each can be complex and
costly. Pre-testing research can be used to select from several alternative
promotional concepts and find the one most effective in achieving objectives.
Post-testing research is carried out to assess whether promotional objectives
have been achieved.
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapter Detailed Review
1. The role of advertising in the promotional mix
Advertising is any paid form of non-personal communication of ideas or products
in the prime media, i.e. digital, television, the press, posters, cinema and radio.
It possesses strengths and limitations, and should be combined with other
promotional tools to form an integrated marketing communications campaign.
2. How advertising works, strong and weak theories of advertising, the
Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)
The strong theory of advertising considers advertising to be a powerful influence
on consumers, increasing knowledge, changing attitudes, and creating desire and
conviction, and therefore persuading people to buy brands.
The weak theory of advertising considers advertising to be a much less powerful
influence on consumers. It suggests advertising may arouse awareness and
interest, nudge some consumers towards trial, and then provide some
reassurance and reinforcement after trial.page 539
The ELM explains how some consumers are highly engaged with a product
purchase and then carefully consider information and linkages to their personal
circumstances. Such highly engaged consumers are said to take the central route
of elaboration, whereas consumers with fewer connections and less commitment
are said to take the peripheral route. The route taken can provide insights for
designing advertising campaigns.
3. When to use adverting and advertising evaluation
The FCB matrix sets out options for when to use different types of
advertising. Planning is based on the type of product, whether it elicits high or low
involvement, and the propensity of the consumer to think/or feel.
Advertising decisions should not be taken in isolation but should be based on a
clear understanding of campaign objective, message execution and media
decisions.
Execution: care should be taken to meet publication deadlines.
Evaluation of advertising: three key questions are what, when and how to
evaluate.
4. How campaigns are organized, including advertising agency selection
An advertiser has the following organizational options:
1. advertising can be developed directly in cooperation with the media
2. an in-house advertising department can be created
3. a full-service advertising agency can be used.
Managing agency relations are central to developing successful mass communication
campaigns.
5. Ethical issues in mass marketing communication
There are potential problems relating to misleading advertising, advertising’s
influence on society’s values, and advertising to children.
There are potential problems relating to the use of trade inducements and the
promotion of antisocial behaviour.
6. The reasons for the growth in product placement, and its risks
Product placement activity is growing because of its mass-market reach, ability to
confer positive associations to brands, high credibility, message repetition, ability
to avoid advertising bans, targeting capabilities, the opportunities it provides for
new linked brands and promotions, and the ability to measure its impact on
audiences.
Its risks are films or television programmes and so on, where the product is
placed, may fail, tarnishing brand image; there is the possibility the placement may
not get noticed or may cause annoyance; and there is also the reduction in control,
compared with advertisements, over the way in which the brand will be portrayed
in the film or television programme.
7. The objectives and targets of public relations
The objectives of public relations (PR) are to foster prestige and reputation,
promote products, deal with issues and opportunities, enhance the goodwill of
customers and employees, correct misconceptions, improve the goodwill ofpage 540
suppliers, distributors and government, deal with unfavourable publicity, and attract
and keep good employees.
The targets of PR are the public, the media, the financial community, government,
commerce (including customers) and employees.
8. The key tasks and characteristics of media relations
Three key tasks are: responding to requests from the media; supplying the media
with information on events relevant to the organization; stimulating the media to
carry the information and present the viewpoint of the organization.
The characteristics of publicity are that the message has higher credibility than
advertising, there are no direct media costs, and there is no control over what is
published (content), whether the item will be published or when it will be published.
9. Crisis management and social media
An important element of crisis management is monitoring the marketing
environment and stakeholder relations. Social media is playing an increasingly
significant role in monitoring and managing crisis-management issues.
There are three key stages in crisis management: pre-crisis, crisis management
and post-crisis.
10. The objectives and methods of sponsorship
The objectives of sponsorship are to gain publicity, create entertainment
opportunities, foster favourable brand and firm associations, improve community
relations and create promotional opportunities.
The two key methods of sponsorship are event sponsorship (such as a sports or
arts event) and broadcast sponsorship (where a television or radio programme is
sponsored).
11. How to select and evaluate a potential sponsored event or
programme
Selection should be based on asking what are we trying to achieve
(communication objectives), who are we trying to reach (target market), what are
the associated risks (e.g. adverse publicity), what are the potential promotional
opportunities, what is the past record of sponsorship of the event or programme,
and what are the costs.
Evaluation should be based on measuring results in terms of sponsorship
objectives (e.g. changes in awareness and attitudes). Formal evaluation involves
measurement of media coverage and name mentions/sightings, using a specialist
monitoring agency.
12. The growth in sales promotion
The reasons for growth are increased impulse purchasing, the growing
respectability of sales promotions, the rising costs of advertising and amount of
advertising clutter, shortening time horizons for goal achievement, competitor
activities and the fact the sales impact of promotions is easier to measure than
that of advertising.
13. The major sales promotion typesMajor consumer promotions are money off, bonus packs, premiums (free in- or on￾pack gifts, free in-the-mail offers, self-liquidating offers and buy-one-get-one-free
offers), free samples, coupons, prize promotions (competitions, draws and games)
and loyalty cards; major trade promotions are price discounts, free goods,
competitions, allowances, promotional price support, and in-store display and
promotional support.
14. The objectives of sales promotion
The objectives of sales promotion are to provide a fast sales boost, encourage
trial, encourage repeat purchase, stimulate purchase of larger packs, and gain
distribution and shelf space.

IS ADVERTISING
‘UNMENTIONABLES’ NO
LONGER A TABOO?
Wilson and West (1981) defined ‘unmentionables’ as products, services or concepts that, for
reasons of delicacy, decency, morality or even fear, tended to bring about reactions of
embarrassment, distaste, disgust, offence or outrage when mentioned or marketed openly.
These unmentionables have been described as controversial or taboo products, such as
cigarettes, as well as personal hygiene products (period products and incontinence products),
sex-related products (sex toys, condoms, erectile dysfunction products and lubricants) and
certain types of medical treatments (haemorrhoid creams, abortion, vasectomy and
sterilization) (Wilson and West 1981; Prevel Katsanis 1994). Even though these types of
products may be considered unacceptable by some, millions of dollars are spent on advertising
products from vaginal cream and toilet seat sanitizers to sexual lubricants and lice shampoos.

Furthermore, the world is constantly changing and while, in many regions, attitudes towards
products previously considered unmentionable do not endure, it is notable that new products
and services become ‘unacceptable’ as attitudes, beliefs, social and cultural norms evolve
(Prevel Katsanis 1994). Fur coats, widely worn as a fashion item and status symbol in the US
and UK from 1920s, are no longer considered ‘politically correct’ and have largely been rejected
by consumers. The fur look has mainly been replaced by faux fur. Increasingly, luxury brandspage 547
from Gucci to Coach are turning their backs on fur, and London Fashion Week is also a fur-free
zone (Watamanuk 2019). Tuna that is not ‘dolphin safe’ is another example of a product moving
into the unacceptable category, and there are many emerging contraventions of environmental
principles that affect the acceptability of products and services.
In this case study we explore the different types of advertising appeal used when
communicating the benefits of unmentionables, and the challenges brands face with this type of
advertising.
Advertising Appeals for Unmentionables
One of the fundamental ingredients of marketing is the ability of the seller to communicate with
the buyer. However, when it comes to unmentionables, communication challenges exist due to
the controversial nature of the products or services that are being marketed (Wilson and West
1981). This means one of the major problems managers face in marketing unmentionables
relates to how to advertise them effectively. Modern consumers rely on advertising for
information, entertainment and relatability, and this is particularly important for taboo or
controversial products that no one wants to talk about. If the product or service being advertised
is unmentionable, feelings of embarrassment, shame and guilt become irrevocably attached to
the purchasing experience (Britton 2018). As a result, the advertising of unmentionables often
requires greater ingenuity and imagination on a marketer’s part, and the use of uncommon
communication channels or the creative use of conventional ones (Wilson and West 1981).
When advertising taboo products and services, one option is to embrace the awkwardness
associated with them and confront the discomfort head-on, thereby normalizing the product.
Rather than avoid the discussion of the product’s taboo nature, advertising may be used to
actively embrace the awkwardness associated with buying or using the product
and emphasize that there is nothing to be ashamed of (Hughes 2015). Many
unmentionable brands are now realizing they can use their advertising to approach consumers
in an informative and thoughtful way, while being frank and direct in their communications
(Monteros 2021). There is a growing belief, when it comes to marketing unmentionable
products, it is all about changing the conversation and tackling the awkwardness head-on. The
thinking is that the more people hear and see taboo products and services advertised, the less
taboo they become (Anon 2020).
Shock advertising appeals, or ‘shockvertising’, may also be used to advertise unmentionable
brands. Shockvertising is an advertising approach that is intentionally designed to attract
widespread attention and trigger a strong reaction as it deliberately violates social and cultural
norms (Dahl et al. 2003). When it comes to unmentionables, this advertising approach can be
very useful in catching the audience’s attention, raising brand awareness and memorability, and
generating word of mouth (Turgeon 2018). However, the use of shock advertising for such
taboo products may fail to connect with the target audience, and may lead to negative feelings
and associations as the target market segment feels exposed and even more embarrassed by
the idea of purchasing the product. In addition, it may lead to the advertising campaign
becoming the subject of complaints, and may even damage brand identity and reputation in the
long term (Ngu 2015).
Humour is another approach commonly used when the subject matter is not generally talked
about. Using humour in the advertising of taboo products can help lighten the mood, defuse the
situation, and make the product or service more acceptable. It can help an unmentionable
brand get noticed, aid the processing of the message and enhance the brand’s memorability.
The use of humour also makes it more likely an ad will go viral (Jones 2017). However, when
advertising unmentionable brands, this is often easier said than done as target messagepage 548
receivers may not see the funny side and there is a chance the ad might cause offence, lead to
negative publicity and affect the marketer’s ability to have their message heard (Olenski 2018).
‘Tampax and Tea’
One brand that has attempted to use advertising creatively to normalize what is viewed by
some as an unmentionable product is Tampax. In 2020, it released a new TV ad that used a
humorous approach to explain correct tampon applicator insertion. The ad, created by Saatchi
New York, was designed to tackle tampon discomfort in a straight-talking way through the use
of humour. It featured the host of a talk show called Tampax and Tea asking her studio
audience how many of them ever feel their tampon. When her guest, a young woman, raises
her hand to indicate she does, the host tells her she shouldn’t and that it might mean that her
tampon is not inserted correctly: ‘You gotta get them up there girls!’, the host exclaims. The ad
then shows a pair of hands displaying how to insert a tampon correctly – ‘Not just the tip, up to
the grip’ (O’Connor 2020). Procter & Gamble, which owns the Tampax brand, said the intention
of the ad was to be light-hearted and focus on a very common usage question. Aired in the UK
and Irish markets, the ad’s aim was to normalize the conversation around periods and educate
people on how to use the product effectively (Boland 2020).
Although the ad’s original intention was not to shock, it appeared to have that effect on some
members of the public. Soon after it aired in Ireland a flood of complaints were made to the
Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland (ASAI), claiming the ad was demeaning to women,
unsuitable for children and contained innuendo (Lynott 2020). No such complaints were made
to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK, where the ad was generally praised for
its approach in tackling what is viewed by some as taboo. However, the ASAI did make the
decision to ban the ad in Ireland, ruling that it had caused widespread offence, based on the
relatively high number of complaints made about it, which the ASAI felt was indicative of
consumer sentiment (McCarthaigh 2020).
Following the ban, P&G admitted it had thought the ad might provoke a small number of
complaints, but had not expected the significant negative reaction witnessed in the Irish market.
It believed the light-hearted, humorous ad was in the best interests of its consumers as it
helped them understand how to make the best use of Tampax tampons and explained how to
use the product applicator. Although P&G chose not to seek a review of the decision made by
the ASAI Complaints Committee, public reaction to the ban was heated as people took to social
media to vent their anger. Those challenging the ban, argued that while great strides have been
made in normalizing the discussion around periods, the ASAI’s decision to pull the Tampax ad
was a setback. It could be viewed as sending a message that periods are something to be
ashamed of, helping to perpetuate the stigma that still surrounds them (O’Connor 2020). The
ASAI responded to this criticism, arguing the ban was justified given the volume of complaints
received, most of which were from women. It stated that widespread offence had been caused
and this was reason enough for it to remove the ad (RTE 2020). This controversy surrounding
the advertising of an everyday product used by half of the world’s population,
shows that the marketing of unmentionables, particularly in mainstream media,
continues to be a delicate matter and is fraught with challenges for marketers. Prevel Katsanis
(1994) highlighted the importance of careful target market selection and ensuring vulnerable
segments of the community are not exposed to unduly controversial advertising appeals.Source: Lex Collection/Shutterstock
Slice-of-life message appeals can be used to prepare an audience for more controversial
messaging by using a rational appeal that enables the message receiver to relate to the
situation and determine their ‘fit’ in the scenario. For example, the Tena Lady
#LastLonelyMenopause campaign used a relationship between a mum and daughter in a slice￾of-life appeal to highlight some of the realities of the menopause (Creative Salon 2022). The
story in the ad links issues associated with puberty with the menopause and, through mildly
humorous scenes, sensitively tackles a range of diversity and ageism issues, which women in
the target market are enabled to relate to their own personal circumstances and thereby access
the relevance of the ad.
Durex #FitMatters
When it comes to the marketing of unmentionables, the advertising and promotion of sex￾related products such as condoms can also present a challenge. In 2022, sexual wellness
brand Durex launched its campaign #FitMatters, which used an informative advertising appeal
that aimed to educate people on the importance of using a correctly fitting condom (West
2022). Durex’s research had found 46 per cent of consumers were not confident about buying
the right condom; this often leads to the purchase of condoms that don’t fit correctly, which
contributes to the belief that wearing a condom reduces pleasure (Anon 2022a). Durex decided
to use an influencer marketing strategy to communicate its message, with its #FitMatters
campaign featuring a range of influencers, from sex-positivity bloggers and podcast hosts to
comedians and couples making relationship content, as well as health expert Dr Emeka
Okorocha and England rugby professional Joe Marler (Houston 2022). Through their own
personal style, each influencer let people know that different condom fits exist and that the right
fit can make sex with a condom a lot more pleasurable. Influencer content was launched across
TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, with an additional push via digital out-of-home and
broadcaster video-on-demand (West 2022). While sex-positivity bloggers such as Venus Libido
used a sexually themed approach to communicate the message that fit matters, other
influencers used a humorous approach to convey this controversial message. For example,
rugby player Joe Marler shot a video in his own back garden, showing him attempting to fit into
a series of objects that are clearly too small for him. While a light-hearted and humorous
approach was evident, the video was still making the serious point that condom fit matters
(Stockwell 2022).page 549
While the subject matter was taboo for some, the general reaction to the campaign was
positive. It was praised for transforming the culture and conversation around condoms and their
use. Durex was aiming to shift behaviour, ensuring its message was inclusive, and speaking to
diverse communities exploring sex and sexuality their way (Anon 2022a). According to
VaynerMedia London, which was involved in the development of the campaign, social media
was central in getting the campaign’s message out there. It wanted to ensure the message
reached people on social media, as this is where the public’s attention is focused nowadays.
Social is important to today’s brands, so the use of influencer marketing on social media was
seen as an important way to partner with people who could talk authentically about the subject
matter with different engaged communities (Anon 2022b).
Conclusion
Different advertising message appeals and media approaches can be used to market
unmentionable products and services, and decisions made in these areas can affect the
public’s reaction to an advertising campaign. One of the biggest challenges facing
marketers of unmentionables is how to advertise their brands clearly and
effectively to their target market. The very language of everyday conversation is frequently off
limits for the marketer of unmentionables, and conventional advertising techniques may be
seen as inappropriate. In addition, the choice of media via which the message is delivered may
also be key to success, so media selection must be carried out with care. For international
marketers, advertising taboo products can be particularly challenging due to varying cultural
sensitivities: an advertising appeal deemed acceptable in one culture may be viewed as
inappropriate in another, emphasizing the importance of very careful target marketing.
However, the notion of something being taboo is a moving target and attitudes towards
unmentionables are changing. As times change and old taboos drop away, it will be interesting
to see if what is seen as unmentionable today will become commonplace and widely
acceptable in advertising in the future.
Questions
1. What are some of the unique challenges associated with the advertising and promotion of
unmentionables? Highlight the main message and media recommendations you would give
brands attempting to market an unmentionable product or service.
2. Outline your views on the ‘Tampax and Tea’ ad. Visit the ASAI website
(www.asai.ie/complaint/health-and-beauty-13), and read the complaints made about this ad
and the advertiser’s response. Based on this, do you think Tampax is to be applauded for
normalizing periods, or was it just using shock-inducing tactics for commercial gain?
3. Use secondary research to learn more about the Durex #FitMatters campaign. Based on
your findings, what are your views on the campaign, and the message and media choices
made?
4. Again using secondary research, provide an example of one unmentionable brand you think
has used marketing effectively to communicate its offering and one that has failed in its
approach.page 550

BLACKWATER TASTERS
CLUB: THINKING INSIDE
THE BOX
Blackwater Distillery
Blackwater Distillery opened in County Waterford in 2015, becoming Ireland’s 21st distillery. An
innovative micro-distillery, the company makes multi-awarding-winning Blackwater No.5 London
Dry Gin, Blackwater Wexford Strawberry Gin, Blackwater Juniper Cask Gin, Blackwater Copper
Pot Still Vodka, Boyle’s Gin, and a range of small-batch limited-edition gins. Boyle’s Gin, which
is produced exclusively for Aldi Ireland, celebrated its fifth birthday by winning a double gold at
the San Francisco World Spirits Competition in November 2021, while Blackwater No.5 Gin
was pronounced Best Irish London Dry Gin at the World Gin Awards ] 2022. Wexford
Strawberry Gin also took home Silver in the Best Flavoured Gin category (Blackwater Distillery
2022b). Blackwater Distillery has supported its innovative positioning strategy through the
release of a number of limited editions, such as Barry’s Tea Gin, Tanora Gin, and Hedgerowpage 552
Gin, to name a few. Blackwater Distillery is a manual distillery, which means it is filled to the
brim with handles, levers, taps and dials. Everything is done by hand and eye. This invariably
takes longer but is in keeping with the traditions the Blackwater team are working to emulate
(Stories & Sips n.d.).
The Blackwater Tasters Club
The Blackwater Tasters Club (Blackwater Distillery n.d.) launched in August 2020 as Ireland’s
first online spirits subscription club. When the pub trade in Ireland closed down in March 2020
as the government responded to the Covid-19 pandemic, the company’s strategic plan to grow
the brand in bars and hotels was put on hold. The pandemic also led to an emergency change
in legislation in 2020, to allow for the sale of spirits online, and this enabled the company to
pivot operations and focus exclusively online. Blackwater Distillery had secured a licence to sell
to the public in 2019; initially intended for use within a planned new visitor facility, this licence
was redirected to the online platform and the Blackwater Tasters Club was launched in August
following 8–10 weeks of planning. As Blackwater Distillery CEO Peter Mulryan describes, ‘we’re
a curious bunch, fizzing with ideas and, with the pubs being shut, we needed an outlet for the
spirited madness’. Initially, the Tasters Club was revealed to potential subscribers through
national press coverage, which drove significant traffic to the website. Satisfied customers
posted their unboxing experiences and gift reviews on social media. Brand advocates and a
select number of social media influencers amplified the Tasters Club unique message.
Blackwater Distillery then leveraged a paid social strategy for Facebook and Instagram to grow
the subscription base of the club.
The Tasters Club Box
As members of Blackwater Tasters Club, customers receive a delightful box of seasonal gins
and unique spirits direct from the micro-distillery straight to their door every two months. The
company manages its own fulfilment operations. Each 100 per cent recyclable box contains two
200 ml bottles, usually at least one gin and occasionally another small-batch spirit, together
with detailed recipes to create the cocktails they inspired and information cards for the ‘Perfect
Serve’. The suggested cocktails use only readily available ingredients and require no additional
alcohol, and each box delivers at least 8 to 10 cocktails or gin and tonic serves.
These unique, experimental limited-edition gins and spirits are crafted exclusively for the
discerning spirit lover, and enable the company to be far more innovative than the mass market
allows. Peter Mulryan suggests ‘it is about doing things on a small scale that would not be
economically viable for large runs. The point is to have fun. It [the box] should come, make you
smile, and then go. And then you get the next one’ (Wilson 2020). Customer suggestions are
taken on board and allow the company to track the seasons with offerings that match
customers’ moods. The club boxes are always different, seasonal and handcrafted, and are not
repeated during a customer’s 12-month membership.
Reflecting this seasonal nature, October boxes included Windfall Apple Spiced Gin and
Wexford Blackcurrant Cassis, and a duo of Star Anise Gin coupled with a Pear-itif Liqueur, with
December boxes featuring a combination of Christmas Pudding Gin and Cranberry VodkaLiqueur. Valentine’s Day boxes have featured Blood Orange Gin and ‘Love Potion No.5 Spirit
Drink’. Jaffa Cake Gin, Limoncello, Raspberry & Rosehip Vodka, and Lavender & Pink
Peppercorn Gin have also been popular releases. Says Peter Mulryan, ‘the Blackwater Tasters
Club is perfect for the bold and adventurous among us who not only love gin but also love
tasting other unique and exciting spirits, all bursting with flavour’ (Lyons 2021). Spirits are
developed exclusively for the club, and 24 small-batch Tasters Club spirits were produced in
2021 by innovative head distiller John Wilcox, and gin distiller and co-founder, Kieran Curtin.
A single Blackwater Tasters Club box is priced at €39.99, or customers can subscribe for six
months (three boxes) for €110, while a 12-month membership gives subscribers six boxes for
€199. Special-edition Tasters Club small-batch spirits are not available for sale through any
other retail outlets and are exclusive to club members. Each delivery includes an invitation for
Blackwater Tasters Club members to join a virtual online Facebook party with the Blackwater
team, who talk through the story behind the spirit and what to expect on the palate, with
comprehensive tasting notes as well as cocktail tutorials with Blackwater’s award-winning
mixologist. The tasting date is announced on each club box card, via email and through social
media channels. Initially restricted to sale in the Irish marketplace, Blackwater Tasters Club now
exports to 11 international markets: the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark,
Sweden, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal and Italy.
Customer Communication and Engagement
Digital activity is dealt with in-house by the Blackwater Distillery team, who reach their Tasters
Club members primarily through four social channels: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and
YouTube. The focus is on connecting with customers through multiple touchpoints, generating
excitement about the product and increasing engagement. Each channel curates Blackwater’s
unique tone of voice, expressing a sense of curiosity and boldness, with a no-nonsense
undertone that differentiates the brand from competitors. A robust social media strategy
communicates the benefits of becoming a member of the Tasters Club and creates excitement
around the innovative, exclusive, high-quality gins.
Digital communications target key segments, such as gin lovers and gift givers (personal and
corporate). Compelling and informative content emphasizes the uniqueness and quality of the
product, driving conversion. Digital storytelling conveys the inspiration behind the beverage
infusions and engages members at a deeper level. Every eight weeks, Tasters Club members
have exclusive access to online Facebook unboxing parties, where mixologists demonstrate the
perfect serve and recreate cocktails based on the exclusive infusions and recipe cards
members have received in their subscription boxes (Grummell 2020). The live-streamed events
present members with a unique online value proposition and a compelling reason to engage
digitally with the brand. During these events, members can interact by posting comments and
asking questions. Tasters Club members are encouraged to guess upcoming infusions and
contribute to future flavour development and flavour combinations. Interactive events
strengthen the community dimension, encouraging dialogue and multi-way conversations with
customers, and cultivating strong brand advocacy. Event content is made available across
platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, to entice new members. Video and content
strategy plays a key role in reaching customers, both new and existing, driving conversion and
encouraging high levels of brand engagement. As part of planned media strategy development,
content from live-streamed events is reformulated into short-form content for future use
(Grummell and Beades 2022).
The presentation box gins are exclusive and not available to purchase in retail outlets, creating
an extremely desirable offering to the market. To strengthen customer relationships, Blackwaterpage 553
Tasters Club often includes a surprise free gift based on a seasonal holiday or brand
collaboration. Members are incentivized to post unboxing content on personal social platforms.
Customer data such as email addresses create opportunities for personalization, soliciting
customer feedback and communicating directly with members. Customers can be targeted with
discount codes if failing to renew subscriptions, reducing levels of customer attrition. The
events, subscription plan and bespoke product offering support a brand premiumization
strategy.
Blackwater Tasters Club’s digital communications strategy employs influencers as part of the
live feature on Instagram. The company has developed successful relationships with a number
of credible and authentic influencers, whose activity amplifies the brand message while giving
access to potential new followers. Blackwater Tasters Club is exploring the viability of TikTok as
a communications channel, enlisting influencers such as Ivan Skyba to promote and augment
the brand message while increasing brand awareness among a broader customer base (Skyba
n.d.).
Brand Pillars
Blackwater Distillery revealed a refreshed brand identity in March 2022, epitomized by the new
tagline #BoldOfSpirit. Fresh, clean and crisp, the new brand design stays true to the roots and
heritage of the company while allowing it to stand out as a premium Irish gin (Blackwater
Distillery 2022a). Building on Blackwater Distillery’s brand pillars of ‘Boldness, Curiosity and
Joy’, the digital communications strategy for the Tasters Club will continue to engage members,
encourage conversion and build strong brand advocacy – leveraging and integrating the
functionality of multiple social and digital channels.
Questions
1. Evaluate the key features of the subscription business model used by Blackwater Tasters
Club.
2. Identify and discuss Blackwater Tasters Club’s online value proposition (OVP).

igital technologies are increasingly important in all sectors of economic
activity; these technologies and related innovations are disrupting
traditional methods of marketing, communications and business models.
Due to its high level of interconnectivity, the internet has been likened to the
wheel and the airplane in terms of its ability to affect the future development
of business, the economy and society. Consequently, firms are rethinking the
role of technology and revising business models and processes to future-proof
their businesses and seize new opportunities. But while firms concentrate onthe adoption of the ever-expanding range of digital solutions, platforms (e.g.
mobile phones, wireless, cloud computing and digital media channels) and
technologies, the speed of innovation and change is constantly intensifying.
For example, the global system for mobile communications (GSM) has
become the fastest-growing communications technology of all time. 5G mobile
telecommunications networks represent a significant upgrade in the capacity
and opportunities to develop businesses online, and in doing so to connect
everyone and everything. In addition, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented
reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are already changing how we
trade, interact and live our daily lives. Consequently, adoption of digital
technologies must be a part of every firm’s business strategy, as these
technologies have profound implications for marketing planning and
implementation. In this chapter, we explore digital marketing by concentrating
on communication channels and platforms. In previous chapters, we examined
big data, analytics and customer insights (Chapter 6), targeting and
segmentation (Chapter 7), and data management and evaluation in relation to
direct messaging and social media (Chapter 15) – areas important to the
application of digital marketing.
We begin this chapter by defining key terms–digital marketing and digital
media–after which we explore the key dimensions of the digital
communications environment. This is followed by a section exploring how to
plan digital media campaigns, and then another on implementation, evaluation
and control of digital marketing. Finally, we consider the dark side of digital
marketing: ethical and societal issues.
What are Digital Marketing and Digital
Media?
Digital marketing can be defined as ‘achieving marketing objectives through
applying digital media, data and technology’ (Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick
2022). Even though digital platforms offer a fundamentally different
environment for marketing activities insofar as the technology has unique
properties that facilitate many-to-many interactive communications, the goals
of the digital communication activities remain like those guiding the
application of more traditional communication tools, for example raising
awareness, encouraging action and increasing engagement.page 557
It is important to understand how digital technologies are used to interact
with target audiences, and the different opportunities to reach wider and more
dispersed target markets as well as individual and personalized segments.
Digital technologies emulate every aspect of marketing communications and
traditional media channels, and in so doing span the marketing mix. This
means the boundaries are less than clear, because digital technology is not only
a means of communication but also a method of product and service
distribution. For this reason, developing communication campaigns can be
highly complex. Marketers are faced with learning how to use and understand
emerging technologies, determining how to make strategic decisions that
enable them to make the best use of the technology and implementing digital
marketing plans that benefit their businesses. Read Hidden Gem 14.1 to find
out how Blue Bottle Coffee built a global brand by educating its audiences
online.
HIDDEN GEM 14.1
Blue Bottle Coffee: From Physical to Digital
Blue Bottle Coffee has origins dating back to the 1600s, when Franz George Kolshitsky
opened central Europe’s first coffee house in Vienna. It was a great success. But it was 319
years later, when James Freeman, a musician and coffee fanatic, set up an espresso cart in
San Francisco in 2002 and, in honour of Kolshitsky, named his business Blue Bottle Coffee.
It was to develop into an international coffee shop brand. Originally, James had no clear
vision or plan for developing a successful international brand–his aim was to make a living
by doing something he loved, which no one else appeared to offer. His coffee was different
to Peet’s Coffee and Starbucks (competitors operating in the area); it was
simply delicious. This ethos has remained central to the business’s success–
the development of its coffee outlets, which number 100 stores across the US, and in
Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and China, and its product range of coffees and
associated products. Nestlé bought a 68 per cent share in the brand in 2017, but takes a
hands-off approach other than enabling Blue Bottle to utilize its expertise and resources.Source: Leonel Calara/ Shutterstock
Deliciousness, cleanness and sustainability
The ethos of success for the brand has come from focus on the product, the way it is
produced (from raw beans to cup) and how it is presented.
The product: Blue Bottle’s coffee buyers work direct with coffee bean farmers to find the
best-tasting coffee, sustainably and ethically produced. In its stores, coffee is prepared
and served at the height of freshness to deliver the best-tasting delicious coffee.
Working with coffee growers the focus is on producing coffee in a way that is not
harmful to the environment. Blue Bottle’s business operations aim to reduce emissions
and eventually to produce zero waste in its stores too. Blue Bottle Coffee is known as a
‘third wave’ coffee roaster, part of a trend to produce higher-quality coffee in a similar
way to artisanal food, wine and beer.
The stores: James utilized his knowledge of music and how breathing influences
emotional tone (he was a clarinet player) to think about silence, what we hear and,
importantly, what we don’t hear. Eventually, these thoughts translated into store designs
and layouts with minimal distractions to interfere with enjoyment of the coffee and the
ensuing conversations between coffee drinkers.
Audience education and connoisseurship
One day in 2004, James opened his coffee kiosk to find a long queue of customers, thanks
to the buzz that had been created by people sharing information about his delicious coffee
by word of mouth (not on Twitter, as it didn’t exist then). It was at this point James realized
the opportunity to grow the business. His first coffee store was opened in San Francisco
and is still open today. But the challenge was how to expand the reach of the business and
enable it to grow sufficiently to attract investment. What made Blue Bottle’s coffee different
was its taste and also its freshness, but production costs meant higher than average prices,
so customers needed to learn why this coffee was special and commanded a high price.
Customer education was facilitated through content marketing/educational marketing, with
brewing guides, and courses on buying, making and storing coffee posted online. Analysis
of organic keyword search revealed this content was acting as a catalyst to attract new
coffee drinkers into the brand’s sales funnel and helping to retain existing customers, who
were developing into fans and advocates. Blue Bottle was doing things differently by using
educational content marketing to turn its coffee drinkers into connoisseurs. In addition, new
products such as brewing kits, AeroPress and pour-over ceramic coffee drippers enabled
educated customers to have the knowledge to buy direct via its e-commerce site. Using a
direct-to-consumer subscription model gave the brand a sustainable cash flow. Social
media boosted connections and helped to grow interest in the brand. Coffee shops and thepage 558
cups with the iconic blue bottle logo were an Instagram hit and coffee drinkers were
encouraged to add trending hashtags to grow the online community. As its connections and
user base grew, Blue Bottle used social media to educate, shares its ethos and promote the
brand.
Today it continues to develop physical (in-store) and digital (e-commerce and social media)
experiences for its customers. In Japan, vivid glass counter tops, stainless steel and
concrete pillars enhance the blue store aesthetic. Its online coffee subscription service
shares regular product releases and updates, and has very high customer retention rates.
Looking to the future, Blue Bottle’s aim is to create a seamlessly connected ecosystem, to
unite people, products and the best coffee-drinking experience.

Furthermore, the widening application of digital technologies suggests
marketers should extend their thinking to encompass all the platforms (e.g.
internet, mobile, web, social media) to permit a firm to communicate and do
business electronically, remotely and virtually.
Digital media are the channels used to communicate and interact with a
target audience online. According to Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick (2022), it is
important to recognize there are not only various digital media, but these also
take different forms:
Paid media: in a similar way to traditional broadcast and print media,
marketers invest in digital marketing (e.g. search marketing, digital display
ads, affiliate marketing) to generate customers. Payment models vary and
tend to involve number of visitors as a payment criterion. Digital media
enable this form of measurement as visitor numbers can be tracked, unlike
traditional media where numbers of interactions cannot be tracked to the
same level of detail.
Owned media refers to digital assets owned by the firm (e.g. brand website,
social media presence, blogs, mobile apps).
Earned media refers to online publicity, word of mouth, feedback, reviews
and conversations on social media platforms. Brands can use influencermarketing to create awareness, educate, and increase engagement and
participation with a brand, and in so doing earn media mentions.
Understanding the benefits of digital media can enable marketers to plan
campaigns that reach online audiences effectively and efficiently. According to
Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick (2022) there are key differences between digital
and traditional media:
Audience pull: unlike broadcast and print media, which push content out
towards audiences, digital media pull audiences towards content. The
significance of this difference is that this approach leads to stronger and
more direct connections with interested targets. In addition, communication
messages can reach individuals rather than mass audiences.
Levels of interactivity: digital media enable interactive and instantaneous
dialogues, providing new ways to engage and build stronger customer
relationships.
Levels of intensity: digital media foster high levels of engagement as users
may wish to be in control of how they receive marketing messages, which
means audiences are less passive and more proactive.
Always on and real time: digital media provide opportunities for marketers
to constantly be connected with their audiences in real time. Campaigns can
be brought to life and updated as events emerge.
The differences between digital and traditional media types reveal new
opportunities for communicating with audiences, but it is important to
remember there are different levels of adoption of digital media: Gen Z, for
example (approximately those born between 1997 and 2012), have grown up
with digital technology all around and are savvy users, whereas baby boomers
(those born between 1946 and 1964) have been less exposed and are more
likely to consider a wider range of media. This emphasizes the importance of
integrating digital and traditional media to maximize the number of
touchpoints (opportunities to see and interact with) inherent in marketing
messages.
Figure 14.1 presents the main digital media channels, each of which is
discussed in the section that follows.
FIGURE 14.1

Social media networks
Social media and social networking are shaping the way some sectors of
society communicate. Social media cut across two forms of media: owned and
earned. A firm will ‘own’ its social media presence on Facebook, Instagram
and Pinterest, but will also ‘earn’ engagement through social media market
campaigns (e.g. by earning ‘likes’ and followers).
The growth of social media networks has been rapid since the mid-2000s,
kick-started by digital natives (Prensky 2001): the keyboard warriors and serial
bloggers who live out their lives online, in communities created at virtual
meeting places like Facebook, Biip, Habbo, Pinterest and Weibo. Social
networking is proving to be the most pervasive digital innovation so far, and so
online activity in this space is of great interest to marketers, who see social
networks as a communication and e-commerce channel. To put the adoption of
social media into context, it took radio nearly 40 years to reach 50 million
listeners and television 13 years to reach the same number, but in just four
years 50 million users had internet access, and in less than one year more than
100 million people had a Facebook account (Tuten and Solomon 2013). The
diffusion and growth rates of social media have also gained pace: while it took
Facebook 8.6 years to reach 1 billion users, it took YouTube and
WhatsApp seven years, and TikTok five (Economist 2021). Thepage 560
merger of Musical.ly and TikTok in 2018 also facilitated the growth in global
appeal of this video-sharing platform, as the former had become popular in the
US and the later in China.
Table 14.1 lists some examples of social media sites, their country of origin
and key community users. There are many online communities, focusing on
various interests from art to education, but by far the most compelling driver of
online community growth is the ability to socialize and share information,
pictures, music and video.

MARKETING IN ACTION 14.1
Gucci Targets Its Customers of the Future Through
Digital Media
Gucci is seen as being the embodiment of Italian luxury (despite being owned by a French
firm). Less well known is how the firm has been able to combine old-world tradition with a
deep understanding of modern technology and marketing techniques. Previously, research
named Gucci a ‘fashion genius’ due to its online capabilities regarding the use of e￾commerce, social media, digital marketing and the integration of smartphone apps.Source: H_Ko/ Shutterstock
Unlike other luxury retailers, Gucci believes in providing a broad selection of products both
in its boutiques and on its website. The reason for this is to ensure customers have the
same Gucci ‘experience’ in both the real world and the virtual one. In the early days of the
web, many luxury brands struggled to move online, but Gucci led the way by having a well￾defined and well-branded digital presence. The brand was an early adopter of Flipboard, a
social network and social news aggregator that combines ‘the beauty and ease of print with
the power of social media’. Gucci also invested in e-commerce infrastructure, so the firm
was well positioned to take advantage of the anticipated growth in online luxury markets.
Gucci’s current digital marketing strategy involves a multifaceted approach using a variety
of social media platforms and digital channels, to target Gen Z consumers, who will form its
future target markets. Young online audience members may not be the largest buyers of
luxury brands but they are powerful influencers. So to attract the attention of this market
Gucci’s CEO Marco Bizzarri and creative director Alessandro Michele implemented a
strategy to reinvent the brand online by using emerging digital technologies (e.g. VR, AR
and AI chatbots) to create innovative content. They also teamed up with online game
platform and game creation system Roblox to develop a fashion-themed game where users
can dress avatars in Gucci fashions and add glitzy accessories.
Recently, the brand also created a collection of AR sneakers, available via the Gucci
Sneaker Garage section of its app. Shoppers can buy the virtual wear and show them off in
partner apps like Roblox and VRchat. Gucci also partnered with Snapchat to promote its
latest sneakers. The brand has successfully created various immersive digital experiences
(e.g. virtual try-ons and 3D visualizations), which resonate with its new target markets. The
success of these efforts can be seen in increases in sales revenue and the size of Gucci’s
online community, with the firm having almost 33 million followers on Instagram, 5 million
Twitter followers and more than 15 million fans on Facebook in 2022.
Marketing insights that other luxury brands can take from Gucci’s experiences highlight: the
importance of engaging younger consumers who use digital media proficiently, via digitally
innovative applications and content; recognizing the importance of the user experience, and
creating tailored and personalized products and experiences; creating a buzz online that
helps to raise awareness of a brand and its products.

Social networks are nothing new, and certainly were not invented by Tom
Anderson (MySpace), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) or Joseph Chen (Renren),
having existed almost since the beginning of humankind. They consist of
people who are connected by relationships, friendships or interests. In 1975,
Burke and Weir (1975) found individuals turn to friends and family in times of
need, and being part of a social community gives individuals a sense of
purpose (Argyle and Henderson 1985). Sociologists suggested a great deal of
our daily lives involves relationships between helpers and recipients (of help)
(Amato and Saunders 1990), and the nature of these relationships is at the
heart of the creation of social networks.
Online social media networks have spread throughout global societies, and
research provides insight into this rapid diffusion (Katona et al. 2010).
Potential adopters of a social network who are connected to many adopters
(already members of a social network) are predisposed towards
joining the network. In other words, if you know many people
who are, say, connected to Facebook, you are more likely to also become a
member of that network than if very few of your friends, family members and
work colleagues are members. You are also more likely to join a network that
already has many members than one that is new with few members. The
purpose of a social network is to enable an online community to use the
functionality and tools of the site (e.g. Pinterest enables the sharing of pictures
and images, YouTube the sharing of video, and WhatsApp offers instant
messaging) to share messages, ideas and content with an online community of
friends (the term used by Facebook).
Social networks are a well-established part of the digital marketing world,
and even though user communities differ in terms of the value proposition to
members and the demographic profile, it is important for marketers to
understand the nature and reach of the platforms they might use as part of their
digital campaigns. For example, PepsiCo developed a ‘meaningful social
media following’ in conjunction with strong retail promotional marketing as
the main part of its campaign to launch and promote its Bubly water. The
brand aimed to position its new sparkling water brand as fun and playful, and
this was reflected in the launch campaign, the product features and flavour
names. The use of social media is attributed with helping the brand to grow by
63 per cent in its launch year (Schultz 2018). A one-week campaign for
Starbucks’ Unicorn Frappuccino brought excitement to its audiences with a
limited-time offer. The arrival of the brightly coloured drink (see Exhibit 14.1)
was leaked on Reddit, which attracted Instagrammers who rushed to buy thedrink, for its photogenic appearance rather than its taste, before it sold out.
Buzz on social media was driven by fear of missing out (FOMO). Both
campaigns demonstrate valuable lessons about the use of social media. They
were successful in expanding the reach of brand messages and increasing
awareness. In the case of the Unicorn Frappuccino, there was much talk on
social media across Europe even through the drink was available only in the
US. The product was aesthetically pleasing, and the ‘super power’ of imagery
on social media is largely due to the brain processing visuals faster than text,
so creating great images means content is more shareable and therefore more
marketable; buy-in on social media enables the sharing of brand messages, and
people who love the brand will spread the word. In this way, creating
excitement increases engagement with and love for the brand (Cresci 2017;
Harrison 2017). Starbucks continues to add new creative twists to its social
media campaigns. In its Red Season campaign, for instance, it teamed up with
A-list celebrity Taylor Swift to promote her Red album and its red festive￾season coffee cup. Her music played in stores, there was a playlist on Spotify
and Starbucks red cup fans could send their friends a Swift-inspired e-gift card
for the festive season (Slater Tate 2021). In a change of direction in 2022 the
brand developed a multichannel campaign using paid, owned and earned
media: ‘The Starbucks Coffee Break’, with actress Ashley Park. In this
campaign ‘being in the moment’ and sharing coffee as part of a meaningful
physical encounter was used to promote ready-to-drink beverages. The
juxtaposition of this campaign demonstrates the importance of current social
setting in social media campaigns (Starbucks 2022).

According to Tuten and Solomon (2013, pp.33–41), ‘social media is the
way digital natives live a social life… it is all about a culture of participations;
a belief in democracy, the ability to freely interact with other people, firm and
organizations; open access to platforms allows users to share content from
simple comments to reviews, ratings, photos, stories and more.’ Being part of a
social media network means individuals and firms share ideas, interact with
one another, work together, learn, enjoy group entertainment, and even buy
and sell.
Here are examples of some social media:
Social community media like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and LinkedIn
enable sharing of ideas and interests, socializing and having conversations.
Social publishing media like YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest and
Flickr enable signed-up members to publish and distribute editorial content,
movies, audio and photos.
Social commerce media like TripAdvisor, Groupon and Facebook
enable buying and selling, trading and the building ofrelationships.
Social entertainment media refers to a change in emphasis, as platforms
offer more engaging content–from personal or brand stories to Twitch (live￾streaming of video games), Mad Libs and Boggle (word games), to Candy
Crush, Clash of the Clans and Pet Rescue Saga (arcade games)–game
playing and entertainment across communities is becoming increasingly
popular.
It is important to consider the network element of social media, as this
makes everything possible, including the interconnections, and informs the
types of marketing message, content and interaction that might be used. For
example, if you are a member of the Facebook social community, the network
elements are the message boards, forums and wikis that facilitate
communication and conversation. In a social publishing environment, a blog
(online diary) often forms the underlying technology. In the commerce arena,
the technology can be deal sites, deal aggregators and social e-commerce
shopping markets.
The greater the number of members of the social media community, and
the greater the number of interactions between them, the more interesting the
network becomes to all involved. In other words, social (life), media
(environment) and network (interconnections–technology and human) are the
three elements that have come together to create social media networks–
currently the fastest-growing online phenomenon, which has relevance for
marketing. Leveraging the opportunities afforded by social media networks for
marketing purposes has led to different tactical marketing applications: viral
and buzz marketing.
Viral marketing is defined as the passing of information about products
and services by verbal or electronic means in an informal person-to-person
manner. Sometimes referred to as buzz marketing, it is about identifying
triggers that will prompt new conversations among target audiences; there are
differences, however, in how messages reach the target audience: viral
marketing spreads across a community of interested targets, gradually building
momentum, whereas buzz marketing is distributed simultaneously to a mass
audience.
An early example of the power of this form of marketing is when an image
of model and reality television star Kim Kardashian near-naked appeared on
the cover of Paper magazine. It created an instantaneous buzz and went viral
on a global scale. Jean-Paul Goude aimed to #BreakTheInternet with this
controversial image of Kim, and in just two hours, it had been retweeted morethan 70,000 times, while within a day, nearly 1 per cent of US browsing traffic
had seen the story (Hershkovits 2014).
Red Bull wanted to drive awareness for its Stratos mission, which aimed to
test the limits of human capabilities and contribute to scientific understanding.
To do so, it set up a team of medical and aerospace experts and, using a
helium-filled balloon, took Felix Baumgartner to the edge of the stratosphere,
where he jumped back to Earth. To engage a global audience for this event,
Red Bull created a destination website and a social media site, and created a
game with a prize of £12,000 for the person who guessed most accurately (on
an interactive map) where Felix would land. The viral part of the campaign
had attracted more than 250,000 followers on Twitter after one day. This
turned out to be one of the biggest events on the internet: 9 million people
watched the jump online, 8 million streamed the video on YouTube, there were
26 million unique visits to the website, and on the day of the event, in just 40
minutes there were 29,000 shares on Facebook of Felix on the ground (Ryan
2014).
The spread of messages through viral marketing is usually driven by
personal interests, which will determine which messages are successfully
shared through social networks and messaging services. However, this can lead
to unpredictable trends emerging. For example, Shabani, a gorilla at
Higashiyama Zoo, captured the imagination (and hearts) of Japanese women,
who referred to him with similar words they would use for actors like George
Clooney and Hugh Jackman: ‘dark and brooding’, ‘hunky’, ‘heart throb’.
Shabani went viral as pictures and comments were widely shared on social
media. This also sent visitors flocking to the zoo to get a closer look at the
primate (Murphy 2015). Recently, this type of campaign has been used to
promote social equality issues, such as the example of Dove’s Reverse Selfie
campaign, aimed at drawing attention to the damage wrought on the self￾esteem and confidence of 13 year old girls by retouching apps (Exhibit 14.2).

Search engine marketing
Search engine marketing involves the optimization of search listings and
keyword searching. For instance, if searching Google using keywords such as
‘jewellery shop’, the search engine will provide a list of firms offering such
services. Search engines like Google, Yahoo! and Bing generate revenue by
charging each time an individual clicks on a sponsored link–the higher up the
listing, the higher the price for click-through. Google sells a product called
Google Ads, which it claims can enable users to attract more customers, help
messages reach the right target audience, get more calls, generate more leads,
and be used on a local and global scale (Google Ads 2022). From this
perspective, search is a type of paid-for digital media. Google Ads connects a
firm with new customers at the precise moment they are looking for the firm’s
products or services. With Google Ads, firms create their own adverts, choose
keywords to help Google match their adverts to their audience, and pay only
when someone clicks on them.
It is very important for advertisers to appear in the optimum position on the
computer screen if they are to attract the greatest number of visitors to their
online offering. By paying for a sponsored link, an advertiser gains a
prominent position on the search engine’s listings. The amount a firm pays
depends on how much it bids for the keywords online users seeking a product
are likely to enter: the higher the keyword bid compared to those of rivals, the
higher the listing. While average cost per click (CPC) can be low, incompetitive industries such prices will increase due to demand for particular
words. Average CPC is calculated by dividing the total cost of a firm’s clicks
by the total number of clicks; in the US, the average across all industries is
$2.69 (Irvine 2022). To make effective use of this mode of connecting with
customers, firms should ensure they choose the right keyword search terms,
understand the analytical data and measure audience responses appropriately
(Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick 2022).
A second method of building traffic to a website is known as search engine
optimization (SEO), or organic search. This involves the achievement of the
highest position in the natural listings on the search engine results pages after a
keyword or phrase has been entered. The position depends on a calculation
made by a search engine (e.g. Google) that matches the relevant site page
content with the keyword (phrase) typed in. Unlike sponsored search (pay per
click, PPC), SEO does not involve payment to a search engine to achieve high
rankings. What a digital marketer needs is an understanding of how to achieve
high natural rankings. Search engines use crawlers, robots and ‘spiders’ to
identify the titles, links and headings employed to assess relevance to
keywords and phrases. It is therefore important to ensure the website includes
the keywords (phrases) a potential visitor might use to search for a firm. For
example, Ragdale Hall Spa’s website includes terms such as ‘weekend spa
break’, ‘spa resort’ and ‘health spa’, because they are key phrases used by
consumers when searching for that type of hotel. This has achieved a high
ranking for the hotel on search engine listings (Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick
2022).
However, SEO has become more of an exercise in behavioural
segmentation than a technical website-development exercise, and so driving
the right type of person to a site might be more important than where the
website ranks for a key phrase. Google suggests more than 200 separate
variables can influence where and how a website finds itself positioned in
search results. Google has put in place changes that might see website owners
‘penalized’ for overzealous SEO activity. There are clearly some organizations
that play the SEO game with consummate success. A search for almost any
consumer product will often find Amazon and eBay returned within the first
few results, by virtue of their size, their authority as sites, their high-level
linking, their involvement in advertising programmes and sophisticated
automation of the SEO process. Within the hotel sector, many specialists
admire LateRooms.com for its ability to perform highly against hotel brands
and other booking services. Firms within highly competitive industries such aspage 564
the insurance business expend huge resources to compete with other firms on
Google. However, some brand names, such as Go.Compare, prefer to spend
that resource in pay-per-click campaigns than on SEO activity–perhaps an
indication that brand awareness and a large pay-per-click budget might be
more important than SEO for certain types of firms. SEO is not a type of paid￾for digital media but a strategic option for improving performance.
Paid search (pay-per-click) is similar to traditional textual advertising. This
type of ad will usually be labelled a sponsored link and appear next to the
organic search results. Google pages appear in this manner and these types of
ads can be effective for raising awareness and generating customer response
(Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick 2022).
Digital and display advertising
Digital advertising is considered a type of paid-for media. Online, advertisers
make an investment to reach a target audience in much the same way as they
would pay for space and time in print and broadcast media (Chaffey and Ellis￾Chadwick 2022). Online is a complex media environment. A recent change to
the buying of advertising is the use of programmatic ad buying
techniques, which enables ads to be served to individuals (using their
personal information and search behaviour) across multiple devices, channels
and screens from mobile phones to interactive TVs. This can mean engaging
TV viewers across a range of devices and thousands of channels. In the past
more generic target market demographics were used, but the highly
individualized approach of programmatic techniques enables digital marketers
to exploit efficiencies in their advertising and control costs more effectively
(Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick 2022). There are various forms of this type of
media, for example digital display advertising, online video, internet television
and affiliate marketing.
Digital display advertising
This aims to get a target customer to act immediately by clicking on the advert
or watching a video. Display adverts include banner adverts, skyscrapers
(vertical tall and narrow banner ads that often appear at the right-hand side of
the page) and pop-ups. There are many different forms of this type of
advertising (see Figure 14.2). This is a popular and effective method; it can be
used to elicit various responses and to meet a range of communicationsobjectives, for example to raise awareness, increase action, change opinions
and boost recall. It is measurable, relatively low cost–as payment is typically
by each click-through on a cost-per-thousand (CPM) basis–and easy to create.
Digital display ads are flexible, come in different forms and can be placed on
websites, social media platforms and mobile devices, the latter having given
rise to opportunities for more creative forms of display advertising. Despite
these advantages, some formats have been criticized: banner ads are said to be
distracting and to interfere with the content of webpages, or are not noticed,
and ad-blocking programs can be used to stop them from appearing to users.
Nevertheless, better and more careful targeting has led to a renaissance for
display advertising. Recently, Google, Facebook and Twitter have seen a
significant increase in spend on this form of advertising.

Online video advertisingpage 565
Media-sharing sites have become increasingly popular, and provide
organizations and individuals with a platform on which to share visual, video
and audio content. Popular platforms like YouTube, Flickr, Vimeo and TikTok
enable sharing of such content in an online environment. There are different
types of content produced, depending on whether it is for an individual or a
business.
Affiliate marketing
This was a popular form of digital display advertising, often referred to as pay￾per-performance marketing. One business rewards another for placing
advertising on its website. Each time a potential customer clicks on the link
through to the originator of the advert website, the third party earns revenue.
Various types of platform can facilitate this type of marketing. For example,
Kelkoo and Moneysupermarket.com are aggregators, which operate a type of
affiliate business model. Quidco is a reward site, which gives its advertisers
and their visitors commission; voucher code sites (e.g. MyVoucherCodes and
hotukdeals) operate a similar model. Affiliate marketing is useful for gaining
visibility and reaching different types of audiences, and allows the cost of
acquiring new customers to be controlled. But in using an aggregator platform
there is also the risk of reputational damage to the brand related to the
behaviour of other affiliates.
In summary, digital display advertising techniques can deliver many
benefits to marketers: reaching and influencing specific target markets, at an
individual level when using programmatic ad buying; stimulating direct
responses that are measurable; and enhanced targeting opportunities. But click￾through numbers can be low and the cost of display ads relatively high. The
placement of ads online is also important: if a brand message is placed next to
undesirable content, this can cause reputational damage. Finally, as mentioned
at the start of this section, it is a challenging advertising environment and there
a numerous adtech partners to choose from, which can make this an expensive
and confusing advertising arena (Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick 2022).
WebsitesWebsites are an important part of an organization’s communication strategy
and are classed as owned media (Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick 2022). The web
offers a high degree of flexibility in terms of what can be created on a website,
along with supporting digital technologies, which have revolutionized how
organizations communicate.
Some organizations have developed highly sophisticated websites targeting
global audiences with an extensive range of products. Others, however, have
been far more timid, developing small-scale experimental applications.
Websites are potentially much more than a form of advertising, as they can be
used for e-commerce, as online stores or information repositories, as blogs,
portals or a gateway to many different services. The choice of website design
will depend on what a firm is trying to achieve online.
Two examples of website types are as follows:
1. Intermediaries’ websites: these act as a portal or gateway to a variety of
content. Examples include:
Mainstream news media sites or portals: these include traditional sites,
for example NYTimes.com, FT.com, thetimes.co.uk, theguardian.com;
broadcasters such as BBC News and Al Jazeera; online portals such as
Google News and Yahoo! Finance.
Social networks, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and
YouTube.
Price comparison sites (also known as aggregators), for example
Moneysupermarket.com, Kelkoo, Shopping.com, Confused.com and
mySupermarket.com.
Super-affiliates: affiliates gain revenue from a merchant they refer traffic
to, by being paid commission based on a proportion of the sale or a fixed
amount. They are important in e-retail markets, accounting for significant
sales.
Niche affiliates or bloggers: these are often individuals, but they may be
important; for example, in the UK Martin Lewis’s website
MoneySavingExpert.com receives millions of visits every month. Smaller
affiliates and bloggers can be important collectively.
2. Destination sites: these are the sites for which the marketer is trying to
generate visitors and may be transactional sites, for example retailers such
as John Lewis Partnership, Amazon and IKEA; financial services such aspage 566
Aviva and PayPal; travel firms such as Ryanair, and manufacturers’ brands
like Procter & Gamble and L’Oréal.
Direct messaging and email
Email is owned media once an individual has subscribed to receive a firm’s
messages, but first marketers must find ways to attract customers. For
example, invites to sign up to receive free offers, to bypass paywalls, to
become a subscriber or buying online are all opportunities for gathering emails
and building a list for future marketing campaigns. This is often done by
driving traffic to a landing page, where email addresses can be harvested.
Marketers must gain the customer’s permission (consent) to send email
marketing messages. Permission-based emails are in use because of
widespread consumer complaints about unsolicited emails (known as spam).
Marketers using this form of communication find ways to
encourage target audiences to opt in to a firm’s emailing list; in
return, recipients will receive materials that match their interests, as they are
more likely to open and read such messages. Email marketing has been found
to be most widely used as a call to action or for sales promotion offers. Many
techniques and tactics can be used to ensure the best performance for email
marketing campaigns, such as sales discounts, rewards and incentives to join a
mailing list. For example, men’s grooming supplies retailer Harry’s built a
$400 million global shaving subscription service through attention-grabbing
storytelling and inviting customers to emotionally invest in its brand and sign
up by sharing their email addresses. It built an automated system to gather
emails and, in the first week of its e-commerce site going live, acquired more
than 100,000 addresses. It also prompted early adopters to refer their friends
via social media by offering rewards, free gifts and prizes (Anon 2022). Email
marketing is discussed further in Chapter 15, as it is now an essential part of
the direct marketing toolkit.
Mobile messaging
Mobile marketing refers to the creation and delivery of marketing
communications messages through mobile devices (phones, smartphones or
tablet computers). Like websites and email, mobile is a type of media that is
owned. Early examples of mobile marketing involved sending text messages
containing advertising to willing recipients; today, apps are widely used, andoffer scope to deliver more creative and engaging content via smartphone.
Messaging can be a powerful cost-effective marketing tool. WhatsApp,
Facebook Messenger, Viber and WeChat are examples of messaging
applications. These apps have an advantage over email as their users do not
have to share their email addresses or sign up to receive content. For example,
the Washington Post used a chatbot in its marketing strategy, which allowed
users to find news articles and tailor the news feed they wanted to receive. The
chatbot works in the Facebook Messenger environment to enable sharing and
exchange of information with users’ personal networks, where it has more than
1.3 billion monthly users and provides instantaneous interactions (Jenblat
2018).
However, widespread adoption of smartphones and an array of wireless
devices have increased capacity for visual as well as text-based content.
Mobile marketing is one of the fastest-growing forms of digital media and
there are more than 6 billion mobile subscriptions globally, so it is not
surprising this media attracts a large proportion of a firm’s advertising spend.
Also it is a highly effective way to engage shoppers with creative, personalized
offers and brings excitement to the shopping experience, for example through
gamification. Consumers are also able to interact directly, constantly and in
real time with their favourite brands. Mobile technology creates a bridge
between virtual worlds and real-life experiences, such as sharing selfies on
social media (Bernritter et al. 2022). Advertisers often encourage the posting
of user-generated content (UGC) and the sharing of personal images to
increase engagement, which has increased the value of platforms like
Instagram as an advertising channel (Campbell et al. 2022).
Arguably, mobile marketing has revolutionized advertising, bringing scope
for location targeting, in-app messaging (sometimes called proximity
marketing) and many other creative applications. However, marketers need to
be aware most mobile users perceive targeted ads and location-based
messaging as irritating and this can have a negative effect on shoppers, leading
to a loss of impact in terms of ad spend. Users can also develop ‘banner
blindness’ on mobile phones, scrolling ad content out of focus so they can
avoid it (Schmidt and Maiier 2022). Also many people prefer to buy via tablets
and computers rather than smartphones, as the mobile experience may not be
easy for some (Orimoloye et al. 2022).page 567
The Digital Communication
Environment
Since 1982, digitization has steadily increased in every area of our daily lives
and the use of digital technologies has become more widespread. Products
such as televisions, telephones, watches, cameras and music have changed to
digital formats. As digitization spreads, the level of inter-connectivity across
devices, between people and locations, increases (e.g. photographs shared on
social networks and stored remotely in the computing cloud). The internet
connects billions of people and organizations around the world, allowing fast
transfer of information. Intranets connect people within a firm, facilitating
communications; extranets connect a firm with its trading partners, such as
suppliers and distributors. The digital communication environment is shaped
by four key dimensions–technology, markets and marketing, channels and
applications, and audiences–each of which has implications for marketing (see
Figure 14.3).
FIGURE 14.3
Key dimensions of the digital ageTechnology
The internet, the web, the cloud and telecoms networks are at the heart of the
digital age and create the infrastructure for all online activity. Mobile and
satellite technologies are revolutionizing the communication industry. They are
widely used in logistics, from the transportation industry and air traffic control
to the individual shopper at home. Tesco, for example, uses mobile and
satellite technology throughout its supply chain: the shopper uses the Tesco
app to check availability of stock in their local store, with its in-store shopping
list feature, then uses TescoPay+ to pay by mobile phone and collect loyalty
points. In-store, one of Tesco’s bestselling items is bananas, and there are
technology systems in place across the supply chain to make sure that this
fruit, from sustainable sources, is readily available on the shelves to meet
customer demand (Tesco.com 2022a, 2022b). The retailer also utilizes real￾time customer data, gathered online and from its app, to predict future
purchasing behaviour, which enables personalized and targeted discounts and
offers to be sent to individual customers. AI, predictive behavioural analytics
and a plethora of connected devices are helping many firms to upgrade their
supply chains using cloud-based platforms, which supports rapid innovation
and maximizes opportunities to respond to consumer demands by having the
right goods in the right place at the right time (Anon 2021).
Transformation of the supply chain is an example of how digital
technology is driving convergence and streamlining operations, enabling more
efficient and flexible distribution across the globe. L’Oréal is using the latest
technology to improve supply chains and customer service as it explores
selling directly to its customers via TikTok, as the global brand recognizes the
importance of social commerce as an important future market (Culliney 2021).
Consumer products are also being combined. For example, smartphones
perform the functions of telephones, cameras, computers, audio systems and
televisions. Convergence offers many opportunities and brings the
convenience of being able to carry out several tasks using just one device. New
services have emerged offered over multiple platforms, such as online
television (e.g. BBC iPlayer), television over broadband (e.g. Apple TV) and
instant streaming of video content (e.g. Netflix and Amazon Prime Video).
Data and information: data are the building blocks on which many of the
applications are built; information is the ‘intelligence’ that can be gleaned from
the data. We covered these topics in Chapter 6.page 568
Intelligent technology: artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR),
virtual reality and other immersive technologies are shaping the next
generation of applications, products and services. Google, Amazon, Xiaomi,
Alibaba and Sonos have developed smart voice-activated devices driven by AI,
enabling users to use natural speech to ask for information, order goods, set
alarms, manage energy in the home and a range of other tasks. The devices are
learning from how they are used so the range of services they offer can be
increased. Already in more than 333 million homes, smart speakers have been
sold globally and the market is predicted to continue to grow significantly; this
is providing a great deal of user data to learn from (Marr 2018; Laricchia
2022). AR enables digital data to be interwoven into a real experience. You
don’t need a headset to experience AR, as this technology is being
incorporated into apps and used by retailers to create enhanced in-store
shopping experiences. For example, Nike enables shoppers to scan clothes and
shoes in a VR world, to find out how they are made; IKEA’s app places its
furniture products in shoppers’ homes using AR on mobile phone,
so they can see how the items will look in the home setting;
L’Oréal allows customers to ‘try on’ make-up and hair colours; while ASOS
uses AR to facilitate the trying on of garments on avatars created by scanning
customers’ bodies (Marr 2021). Technology is enabling marketers to rethink
how they do things and providing opportunities to reinvent many areas of
business.
Markets and marketing
The development of digital technologies and their widespread adoption has
significant implications for the reach and nature of markets and marketing. The
rapid pace of innovation and change in the digital environment means there are
many challenges for marketers to manage. There is also a growing debate
around how digital is affecting the concept of marketing. On one side it is
suggested that the marketing funnel approach to planning, whereby marketers
use a limited number of channels to engage their target audiences, is no longer
appropriate. It is suggested ‘the proliferation of digital platforms has forever
changed consumer engagement with businesses’ and accessing target
audiences can be achieved only through digital-driven data analysis of
customer conversion rates to determine the most appropriate channels to use
(Sprout Social 2020). However, on the other side of the debate, the focus is
more traditional, where the marketing concept remains central and it isbusiness as usual in what has been referred to as the ‘post-digital world’
(Friedlein 2015). In this world, digital is merely a new set of tools and
platforms that should be applied creatively to support marketing and
communication objectives.
Globalization of markets and competition
According to research, ‘global connectivity opens up new avenues for business
in a manner that traditional commerce conduits cannot match’ (Pyle 1996).
Many established brands are successfully taking advantage of these online
opportunities to expand globally (e.g. Tesco, Zara, Walmart, Target). However,
virtual merchants–global online players like Amazon, ASOS, Netflix and
‘disintermediators’–have cannibalized the supply chain by going straight from
manufacturer to end consumer (e.g. Dell.com and the Alibaba Chinese e￾commerce platform, which serves all markets via its websites), and in so doing
are redefining how firms compete.
Digital markets and online trading are providing opportunities for
innovative and dynamic firms that have read the market well and have an
effective business model to make a strong impact and, in so doing, to grow
very big and powerful very quickly, as in the case of Google, Facebook and
eBay. The experiences of these organizations demonstrate how digital
marketplaces are a fertile environment for global expansion if organizations
have good ideas supported by an appropriate set of core competences and
capabilities (Doherty and Ellis-Chadwick 2010a). These discussions link to the
later chapters on competition (Chapter 18) and global strategy (Chapter 20).
Multichannel and omnichannel operations
Multichannel operations are becoming the de facto approach to managing
online and offline operations. Most businesses have harnessed the digital
media to provide information, deliver communications, collect market research
data, promote goods and services and, ultimately, support the online ordering
of merchandise, as an extremely rich and flexible new channel. Digital
channels are a mechanism for broadening target markets, improving customer
communications, extending product lines, improving cost efficiency,
enhancing customer relationships and delivering customized offers (Srinivasan
et al. 2002) through their cross-operations (Doherty and Ellis-Chadwick
2010a).page 569
A multichannel strategy brings together the different routes a firm uses to
access its market. Arguably, the aim is to create a customer journey that
seamlessly links together every point where the customer ‘touches’ a business,
to create what appears to be a single-channel approach, even though many
different channels are involved (omnichannel). This includes traditional and
digital communications and distribution channels operating together. (These
discussions link to further issues associated with channel development and
management in Chapter 17). During the Covid-19 pandemic many retailers
achieved a much higher return on investment from their websites and mobile
apps, as shoppers turned to buying online, through apps and social commerce
due to lockdowns restricting opportunities to visit stores and digital media
channels providing a safe, hygienic environment in which to shop.
Continuous trading
The internet never closes: 365-day, 24/7 trading is a reality, and firms are being
pressurized to manage their interfaces with customers on an ‘open all hours’
basis. Many firms provide self-help information on their websites,
which customers can access around the clock, but they also provide
call centres, and customer services and returns departments, which provide
real-time support via phone or online.
Remote and mobile working
Many more people are now working remotely than was previously the case.
New technology and software applications are facilitating this process and
making more things possible. For workers, many advantages are afforded by
the flexibility of working from home. On the plus side, travel costs are reduced
and workers have more control over how they plan their working day;
however, on the negative side, there can be an increase in family conflict, lack
of understanding from family members about the tasks the worker must
complete, and pressure on the space needed to successfully carry out a job at
home. There is also the loss of interaction with other members of the
workforce, and managerial support is available only on a remote basis.
Covid-19 caused unprecedented disruption in the workplace, with firms
and organizations having to rethink their operations, and what started out as a
temporary adaptation in the pandemic crisis–the use of flexible working
patterns and videoconferencing–has become the ‘new normal’. Research in theUS found more than 50 per cent of workers can now work from home for at
least part of the week, and it has been proved that many occupations can be
carried out totally remotely (Dua et al. 2022).
Additionally, with social support from the workplace for remote workers,
many of the negatives of working from home are reduced (Wylie et al. 2010).
Social media have been found to offer support, and to boost employee
satisfaction, trust and productivity (Snoad 2011). Many firms (e.g. Meta, 3M,
SAP, Airbnb, Dropbox and Fujitsu) are switching to permanent remote
working. Large firms with multinational operations are finding the flexibility
of home and remote working is opening opportunities and creating improved
job satisfaction for employees. With the major migration that began during the
pandemic, this shift has been found to deliver many ongoing benefits for
families, who are benefiting from an improved work/life balance, while firms
are seeing increased productivity, leading to operational cost reductions. These
shifts in working patterns are leading to positive social and cultural changes,
such as health benefits and reduced stress, and potentially less impact on the
planet as an increasing number of employees are no longer required to
commute to work daily (Hunter 2019; Elldér 2020). There are some potential
pitfalls too, however, such as underutilization of the existing facilities firms
may own, the ongoing costs of maintaining existing workspaces, and changing
work cultures and rules as to how flexible working practices are
operationalized. Marketing managers need to evaluate both the benefits and
the pitfalls when dealing with flexible working (Soga et al. 2022).
Channels and applications
Marketers wishing to take advantage of the opportunities created by the digital
environment need to make sure their plans are integrated into their wider
strategic goals if they are to garner the best advantage (Doherty and Ellis￾Chadwick 2010b). (See Chapter 17 for further discussion of marketing strategy
and planning.) They need to identify the channels and applications that open
competitive opportunities or create completely new markets.
Websites, e-commerce and social media
The digital environment provides firms with highly effective channels for
broadening target markets, improving customer communications, extending
product lines, improving cost efficiency, enhancing customer relationships andpage 570
delivering customized offers. Channels, as we have already discussed, have
disrupted marketing communications and created many new opportunities for
firms to interact with existing and new markets.
Software applications, AI, AR and robots
New intelligent software applications are reshaping how we interact with
devices, applications and digital content:
AI applications are set to transform marketing as big data is used to power
customer analysis and predict behavioural responses.
AR is leading to the creation of immersive applications, enabling people to
use their mobile phones to link the physical and the digital worlds. For
example, US retailer Home Depot added 3D AR to its app to enable
customers to visualize how products might look in their own homes. Real￾time data from consumers enables retailers to rethink their stores and tailor
customer experiences to match expectations. Customized products are
available, such as Sephora’s AR app, which allows customers to try on make
up before buying, while Nike has updated its app to enable customers to use
AR to find shoes that are the perfect fit (Thomas 2019).
Robotics applications that can be used in the digital marketing and
media space are also emerging, and are increasingly being used in
a wide range of industry settings, such as security, customer service,
entertainment, food preparation, manufacturing and healthcare.
Chatbots are computer programs that can respond to customer queries and
messages automatically. When combined with AI, these applications can
become powerful customer service applications. Implications for marketers
are efficiencies that can increase a firm’s agility in responding to customers
and the trading environment (Wang, X. et al. 2022).
Apps and mobile communications
Mobile communications network technology has undergone significant
change–when Apple launched its iPhone in 2007, it kick-started a revolution in
mobile applications (see earlier discussion). Mobile phones have increased
facilities for receiving multimedia content, and online television has become
widely available. Mobile has significantly increased the potential for digital
marketing; extended reach through digital media and provided the
technological environment to deliver ‘marketing on the go’. From location-based promotions and shopping, buying tickets and booking restaurants to
highly interactive experiences, apps are changing how consumers interact with
brands, and creating opportunities to develop competitive advantage, enhance
customer perceptions of value, and create positive and engaging customer
experiences (Stocchi et al. 2021).
Experiences
In digital environments, experiences have become important in framing digital
products. The sharing economy, which is embodied by peer-to-peer sharing
and collaborative consumption, offers new business models where production
and consumption are introducing social efficiencies and new experiences, and
have sparked the growth of digital-first brands, which are reinventing how
physical and digital environments intertwine. Airbnb is an example of one such
brand, having reinvented areas of the travel industry by offering new
experiences, greater flexibility and more personal stays. The Airbnb business
model challenges traditional operators in the travel accommodation business,
increasing choice, driving down price and extending experiences (Lu and
Tabari 2019). Uber, the ride-sharing digital brand is another example. Sharing
of experiences can empower participants; both providers and consumers,
giving greater access to resources, promoting more social connections and
creating many benefits (Wang, D. et al. 2022).
Audiences
For their users, the internet and digital media have not only provided the
means to find, buy and sell products, but have also created an environment for
building communities, where like-minded people can network, socialize and
be entertained. Figure 14.4 shows levels of internet penetration in various
countries around the world, and even though many are approaching 100 per
cent, others have large percentages of their populations still not online.
FIGURE 14.4

Exponential growth in internet usage began in the US, where its
commercialization began in the early 1990s, and spread throughout Europe to
Oceania, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. As the use of digital media grows, a
major challenge for marketers is how to make best use of what is on offer.
Across the world, there are different types of audiences: shoppers, information
searchers, businesses and communities’ members are now happy to use digital
technology as part of their daily lives. Target audiences are discussed further in
the next section, on digital marketing and digital media campaign planning.
The dimensions of the digital age have far-reaching implications for marketers.
Technology is driving the development of new routes and channels to market.
Digital markets are growing, extending their reach and opportunities to trade,
and challenging the definition of marketing. Existing and new firms are
continually in competition for market share. Myriad new applications are used
to entice growing audiences to live part of their lives online and are changing
how we interact with technology. To succeed, online firms should plan
carefully how to use digital technology strategically and tactically.Digital Marketing Campaign Planning
This section explores digital marketing planning. The decision as to how to
plan, resource, integrate, implement and monitor digital marketing activities
can be guided by applying established marketing management principles and
planning activities (as discussed in detail in Chapters 2 and 18). Digital media
can be used to meet a range of different business objectives: achieve sales,
communicate, or focus on the development and maintenance of mutually
satisfying long-term relationships with customers by using digital
technologies. Therefore, the types of activities will determine the strategic
significance of the plan and give focus to the operational context.
Forming a plan
The formulation of the digital marketing plan is likely to be informed by four
significant and interdependent elements (Doherty and Ellis-Chadwick 2004)
(see Figure 14.5):
1. Strategic alignment of digital marketing activities with corporate marketing
and marketing communication strategies is important, as it should ensure
development of a potentially successful digital marketing plan. This process
should also help to define the purpose of the digital marketing activities.
2. Integration of digital media with traditional tools and techniques is
essential. This means planning is required to consider all the touchpoints in
a customer’s journey and ensure customers receive a consistent message.
Integration also requires a cross-firm approach, bringing together cross-firm
teams to achieve unified strategic-level corporate and marketing goals as
well as tactical communication goals (Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick 2022).
3. The value proposition should emphasize the unique advantages created
using digital technologies, for example choice (Amazon.com offers the
world’s widest and deepest range of books at very low prices), convenience
(Tesco.com offers round-the-clock shopping), community (Facebook brings
together people around the world). The value proposition created through
the relative advantage afforded by digital technologies should reinforce core
brand values and be clearly articulated to target audiences. It will also
determine the extent to which organizational change is required.page 572
4. Implementation: organizational change is likely to be required if a digital
marketing plan is to be delivered successfully. A good example to consider
is how retailers like Tesco and Sainsbury’s have developed unique logistical
solutions to support online ordering. E-commerce initiatives can involve
applying a wide range of digital technologies: internet, EDI (an electronic
data format that allows firms to complete transactions online), email,
electronic payment systems, advanced telephone systems, mobile and
handheld digital appliances, interactive television, self-service kiosks and
smart cards. Consequently, the integration of such technologies may require
significant changes to operations and working practices to ensure the right
skill sets (capabilities) and resources are available when required.
Tuten and Solomon (2015) found it important to assess digital
competency and provide ways to introduce digital technology into working
practices. They advocate a three-stage process, as follows:
The trial phase, which encourages experimentation and ‘play’, and
exploration of the scope of digital media.
The transition phase, where more significant use occurs; this can be
considered a mature phase. For example, Bealls, a US department store,
began using digital display advertising in the early days to drive traffic to
its website, promote sales, and so on. It then made use of social media in
order to engage its target audiences in conversation; as part of this second
phase, the firm’s Facebook pages are updated several times a day, and
commercial fan coupons are released so they can be shared among the
community. In this phase, the use of social media becomes more
sophisticated and more integrated with the IMC and marketing strategy.
At this level, examples of objectives are improving public relations and
increasing product awareness.
The strategic phase: this occurs when an organization enters the final
level. At this point, the use of digital media will be fully integrated across
business activities and incorporated into all levels of planning.
Implementation of the plan should be executed in a timely manner.
Additionally, the success of the digital marketing plan is likely to be affected
by senior management commitment, availability of appropriate resources
and the appropriateness of the strategic vision guiding the implementation.
The significance of the digital marketing plan for a firm’s overall strategy
will also be largely dependent upon levels of technology adoption,
investment and integration.FIGURE 14.5
Elements of digital marketing planning
In addition, analysis of the marketing environment (as discussed in
Chapters 2 and 3) should take place in order to determine the likely relevance
of digital marketing and opportunities that might be pursued. See Exhibit 14.3.

Setting objectives and the RACE framework
Developing a plan for using digital marketing and media is much the same as
any other marketing planning exercise insofar as there is a requirement to
understand the situation in which they are going to be used, the needs of the
target audience and their behaviour. Once environmental analysis is complete
and the broad focus of the campaign has been established, the next step is to
determine its direction and purpose, and to set objectives. This is perhaps
where the planning process becomes more complicated. To state objectives, a
firm must be clear about the types of objectives that can be achieved.
According to Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick (2022), the RACE planning
framework (Reach, Act, Convert, Engage) is important for managing key
planning activities and aids clarity when evaluating objectives (see Figure
14.6):
Reach relates to objectives of increasing awareness and driving visitor
numbers in different forms of digital media, such as web, mobile and social
networks. A campaign aiming to capture the attention of new digital
audiences or to introduce existing audiences to new products and services
will need to consider which digital media are the most appropriate for the
desired target audience. This may include paid, owned and earned media to
raise the number of unique visitors. Measurement analytics may include
website bounce rates, time on site and comparison with rates achieved by
competing brands online, and number of brand searches.
Act relates to objectives of increasing interactions and generating new
prospects. Measurement analytics may include percentage of conversions in
relation to the number of leads generated, goal value per visit and page
views per visit. For these types of objective, it is important to consider
where the customer is in their brand journey and to use data profiling to gain
greater understanding of their behaviour. Also, it is important to link these
objectives closely to content management strategy.
Convert relates to sales and profits objectives. By this stage, a firm
will have a very clear understanding of the target audience, which
should enable high levels of personalization, tailoring of customer
experiences and multichannel selling opportunities. Analytics may measure
the percentage of conversions, sales values and the average order value.
Engage objectives relate to encouragement of customer loyalty and
increasing advocacy. Objectives will focus on the percentage of active
customers, and measurement may include percentage of customersconverted from inactive to active, percentage of existing sales, and brand
mentions in social media networks. To achieve these objectives, a firm can
consider ways of attracting and signing up customers, ensuring a great
customer experience and high levels of customer service. Social media play
an important role in achieving these objectives.

Selecting the target segment
For marketing managers, it is increasingly important to understand target
audiences from a digital perspective, as significant changes are taking place
resulting from more and more interactions between organizations and their
audiences via digital technology. (For a more detailed discussion of targetpage 574
audiences and related segmentation strategies, see Chapter 7.) Arguably, every
dimension of real-world relationships is replicated in digital form.
When assessing a target audience, the following information will be useful
(Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick 2022):
Customer connectivity: the proportion of the target audience having access
to relevant technologies.
Customer channel usage: how often the target market audience use online
channels and how they use the digital channel/platform (e.g. purchase or
research). For instance, for each customer segment and digital channel (e.g.
web, digital television, social media, mobile), a firm should know the
proportion of the target market that:
makes use of and has access to a channel
browses and, as a result, is influenced by using the channel for pre￾purchase research and evaluation
buys through the channel.
Digital media consumption: how many hours each week are spent using the
web, social media and mobile in comparison with traditional media such as
watching television, reading newspapers or magazines, or listening to the
radio.
In addition, marketers should consider the competition and be able to
answer the following questions:
What specific strategic resources, capabilities and competences are required
for successful digital marketing?
How well are the expectations of consumers being fulfilled by the firm’s
digital marketing activities? For example, is the website easy to use? Are the
email or mobile campaigns well received or regarded as intrusive?
What is the number of visitors to the website per month? How many
viewers watch the interactive television (iTV) commercials?
What is the average length of time visitors spend on the website?
What are the most popular pages and products? What are the least popular?
Which product categories generate most sales?
Conversion rates: what is the proportion of visitors who place an order?
What is the proportion of recipients of email or mobile campaigns orproportion of iTV viewers who place an order?
Click-through rates: how many visitors arrive at the website from banner
advertisements or weblinks from other sites?
Findings from the internal and external analysis should feed in to
marketing objectives, and the creation of competitive advantage and
communication plans.
Other important considerations are as follows:
Digital engagement: perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for
consumers to go online is there is a wealth of information that can improve
the efficiency of their shopping behaviour and reduce their risk. Information
in the digital world is enhanced by user participation. Product descriptions
and price comparisons and reviews, generated by sellers and buyers, abound
and provide a rich tapestry of information. Ranking systems exist to help
reduce the need for guesswork, for example Feefo, the global feedback
engine (www.feefo.com/web/en), produces product ratings for buyers and
customer experience insight for sellers. Marketers have become interested
not in whether customers are using digital sources as part of their decision￾making, but in what types of information customers are signing up to.
Research shows digital and social media platforms have become
increasingly important in the purchasing decision-making process. For
instance, in the consumer services sector, there is an increasingly intense
struggle for power between the consumer and the service provider. Sites like
Booking.com, Tripadvisor and Trivago freely allow visitors to find hotels,
restaurants and other places of entertainment, and to air their views on the
service they have received. On one hand, consumer audiences have access
to tools that can help them disseminate their levels of satisfaction and
dissatisfaction far and wide, through feedback and posting on social media.
On the other hand, consumer service providers have a wealth of consumer￾oriented data that could enable them to better predict their customers’ needs
and requirements, and in so doing create more effective IMC campaigns.
For example, Britvic set out to create a ‘light touch’ communication strategy
that would engage the interest of parents of 10 year olds. The soft drinks
firm monitored online behaviour when it launched its Fruit Shoot website.
Once the site was established, Britvic launched its ‘Parents for Playgrounds’
campaign and monitored what people were responding to, then tailored the
content to suit their interests. This is a very different approach to planning
an eight-week advertising campaign with fixed content and messages
(Nutley 2011).page 575
Behavioural targeting: digital marketing and media allow advertisements to
be targeted on an individual basis. Behavioural targeting (or personalized
digital advertising) is a method of directing advertisements at consumers
based on their previous online behaviour. At its most basic, it is the Amazon
‘you’ve bought this, so you might like to buy this’ approach. However, more
sophisticated behavioural techniques log where internet users have been
surfing online, using cookies. Once this is known, advertisements on other
sites appear based on that information. For example, an online user could be
browsing cinema listings when a banner advertisement for bargain breaks in
Rome appears–something the user had been researching a few days
previously.
Digital buyer behaviour: a huge amount of research has been conducted to
try to understand typical online buyer behaviour. Other influences identified
from a body of academic research carried out during the past 20 years
(Doherty and Ellis-Chadwick 2010a) are as follows:
Demographic variables: these are personal attributes that tend to remain
static throughout an individual’s lifetime, such as gender and race, or that
evolve slowly over time, such as age. Key elements of a customer’s
demographic profile that have been found to influence their online
behaviour include such variables as income, education, race, age, gender
and lifestyle (Hoffman and Novak 1997).
Psychographic and behavioural variables: these are any aspect of a
person’s perceptions, beliefs and attitudes that might influence their
online behaviour and their intention to shop. Indeed, behavioural
characteristics–such as knowledge, attitude, innovativeness and risk
aversion–can also affect a person’s intention to shop. For
example, it has been found that consumers who are primarily
motivated by convenience are more likely to make purchases online,
while those who value social interactions are less interested in this
approach (Swaminathan et al. 1999).
Personal profiles: these include age, gender, education and salary. Indeed,
it is important to note online shoppers are no longer likely to be greatly
different from their offline counterparts (Jayawardhena et al. 2007).
However, it is perhaps useful to differentiate between the most
enthusiastic and profitable internet shoppers. For example, it has been
found the internet is a favourite channel for the compulsive shopper, as
consumers are able to ‘buy unobserved’, ‘without contact with other
shoppers’, and in so doing, ‘experience strong positive feelings during thepurchase episode’ (Kukar-Kinney et al. 2009). This study, which looked at
the behaviour of internet shoppers from six countries, including both
developing and developed countries, found a surprisingly high degree of
homogeneity in their characteristics and habits (Brashear et al. 2009).
Online shoppers were found to share a desire for convenience, were more
impulsive, had more favourable attitudes towards direct marketing and
advertising, were wealthier, and were heavier users of both email and the
internet.
Logistics of buyer behaviour: where consumers are making their purchases
is changing, but online is not always the first choice. According to a recent
survey by Gallup, the number of online shoppers is increasing. For example,
in the US in 2014 approximately a third of the population shopped online,
and this number has grown year on year. However, another study found
some shoppers are increasingly going to physical stores, attracted by the
service offer from their favourite retailers. Indeed, if the online experience
does not match up to customers’ expectations, they are likely to become
disengaged with the digital offer. Furthermore, the digital experience, if
repeated frequently, can lead to customers becoming agnostic towards a
brand if they become frustrated with the technology associated with
websites and mobile apps (Borges and Veríssimo 2014; Deneen and Yu
2015).
When consumers shop is changing too. Research suggests shopping online
and via mobile apps can occur when consumers are at work, watching
television or even in bed. Very Group, with annual sales in excess of £2
billion and nearly 2 million website visits daily, is the UK’s leading digital
retailer (Very Group 2022). It discovered laptops and PCs are the principal
shopping devices, with shoppers increasingly going mobile (Shop Direct
2014). This flexibility in purchasing methods means the times at which we
buy are changing (Shop Direct 2014). For example, on Black Friday, Cyber
Monday and other peak online shopping days, we buy throughout the day
and night, and eBay sellers have found Sunday evening a peak buying time.
Nevertheless, if you go to Oxford Street or 5th Avenue a few days before
Christmas, the streets will still be crammed with people and the tills ringing
at a rapid rate.
Creating competitive advantagepage 576
Marketers have long accepted success demands identification of some form of
competitive advantage capable of distinguishing an organization from other
firms operating in the same market sector. The unique properties of digital
technologies offer opportunities to establish new forms of competitive
advantage. These include highly tailored communication campaigns that can
be designed to meet very specific communication objectives. The secret of the
success of most digital operations is they have exploited digital market
advantages and new technologies to deliver a value proposition superior to that
of their competitors. Read Mini Case 14.1 to see how Amazon and other
leading brands have used creative IMC campaigns to capture seasonal market
share.
MINI CASE 14.1
Advertising Appeals Aim to Go Viral With Festive IMC
Campaigns
Implementing a successful digital campaign is important, gaining the attention of required
visitors and engaging their interest sufficiently for them to act. During the festive season,
retailers have traditionally launched their advertising via broadcast and print media, but now
they rely heavily on multimedia campaigns, including digital media. Retailers deploy
different creative executions to grab the limelight and create excitement ahead of the
campaign launch.
Celebrity endorsement
In 2018 John Lewis Partnership opted for superstar celebrity Elton John as the star of its
Christmas ad. Elton’s hit ‘Your Song’ played throughout, while moments of truth (in his life)
were revealed to the viewing audience, taking us back to when the young Reginald Dwight
received a piano for Christmas. The television premier of the ad came during a primetime
show, Dark Heart, on ITV, but a teaser campaign had leaked the news and by the time the
ad was shown there had already been more than 1.8 million views on YouTube.
Interestingly, not one product was displayed and the strapline–‘Some gifts are more than
just a gift’–did not appear until the last frame. In 2021, Aldi joined with England footballer
Marcus Rashford for its family Christmas TV ad campaign, which offered a new take on
Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol to send out the message that the discount retailer was
donating 1.8 million meals over the festive period.Source: Hadrian/Shutterstock
Social mood
In the 2021 festive season, with memories of recent Covid lockdowns still fresh in people’s
minds, retailers sought to entertain and create a feel-good mood with their advertising. Ads
for Morrisons supermarket focused on making farmers the heroes of Christmas, showing
the effort involved in producing festive food. Sainsbury’s celebrated the joy of friends and
families coming together again following pandemic lockdown restrictions. Tesco was also
keen to get the message across that ‘This Christmas, Nothing’s Stopping Us’, but showing
Santa with a Covid vaccine passport was not popular with audiences as this was too much
of a reminder of the pandemic, and it became the second most complained-about ad of all
time, with just over 5,000 consumer complaints.
Music and likeability
A campaign for Amazon used smiling animated boxes and music to grab viewers’ attention.
Unlike other retailers’ campaigns, this one was run across nine countries. The smiling
boxes’ rendition of The Jacksons’ ‘Can You Feel It’ aimed to achieve high levels of
memorability, following on from Amazon’s success with its 2017 campaign. The timing of the
ad was planned to coincide with Amazon’s announcement of its Black Friday shopping
extravaganza. In 2021 Amazon’s global festive campaign promoted community, and
celebrated small acts of kindness to the sound of the Adele song ‘Hold On’.
Surrealism and fantasy
Lidl developed an ad that looked to the festive seasons of the future, with the aim of enticing
shoppers to move forward with their purchasing. The ad was not the supermarket’s most
successful, but its own-brand festive jumpers attracted 124 per cent more Google searches
than they had the previous year.
Augmented reality and a connected experience
In 2021, John Lewis, created an AR experience for its festive advertising extravaganza. The
brand invests heavily in advertising at this time of year as there is pressure to produce good
sales figures. Its ad also needed to attract more customers to its e-commerce platform as
the brand had invested £150 million in digital channels and a new distribution centre. The
ad was part of a package of events and digital applications designed to deliver a more
connected customer experience. Shoppers could use QR codes for seamless in-store and
online purchasing; live-streaming events from style guru Gok Wan were added to the
communication mix, and the virtual Christmas tree feature on its website helped customers
buy the right size tree for their homes. The aim was to use digital technology to inspire
shopper action, make the shopping experience easier and give customers all thepage 577
information they needed to be inspired to shop. John Lewis successfully moved beyond the
advert to encourage longer-lasting interaction with the brand.
Shock advertising
Iceland frozen foods also chose animation, which was a change of direction for the brand as
it has tended to use celebrities, which fitted its target audience in the past. But for Christmas
2021, Iceland chose to use technology (special effects) to create a highly controversial
campaign that told the story of a young person and an orangutan. The tale was far from
creating the warm feeling and jollity of the ads of other retailers. This was a somewhat
harrowing story about the effects of deforestation, the destruction of the rainforest and the
use of palm oil in foodstuffs. The advert was launched online and on television, and was
accompanied by a life-size animatronic orangutan, which appeared in strategic locations
around the UK. Shortly after its launch, however, the advert was banned due to breaching
political rules of advertising. The ban prompted a public outcry; politicians,
celebrities and other well-known faces, from James Corden to Anna Friel,
supported a campaign to reinstate the advert, which had garnered more than 12 million
views on Facebook and YouTube, outstripping the viewing figures achieved by other adverts
(at the time). There was also an online petition, which recruited more than three-quarters of
a million supporters within a few days of the ban’s imposition.
In conclusion
Retail brands take different routes to getting their ads to go viral in the festive season, but
while it appears getting an ad banned might just be the most effective tactic for grabbing the
attention of digital eyeballs, creating fun and a feel-good vibe may be better at driving
spend, which is what festive advertising is really about. Customer research revealed that
Marks & Spencer’s 2021 ad featuring an animated fairy (voiced by actress Dawn French)
and Percy Pig was the one most likely to encourage shoppers to buy from the brand. But
maybe John Lewis was really the biggest winner, as it used its ad not only to drive sales but
also to build a digital future for the brand.
Questions:
1. Review a selection of the latest festive adverts from retailers of your choice and
analyse which appeals are being used.
2. Identify any new types of appeal and innovative use of digital media channels.
3. Use desk research to find evidence on your chosen adverts, and then debate which
are the most effective at: (a) attracting attention; (b) potentially building long-term
customer relationships.

Creative content marketing
According to Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick (2022), creative content marketing
is central to digital campaigns. This is because content drives engagement withpage 578
target audiences through searches and social media. Ultimately, having the
right content will affect customer conversion rates, help a brand increase its
visibility on the web, mobile and social media platforms, aid customer
motivation and engagement, and eventually help develop sales.
Effective content can vary depending on the goals of a digital campaign.
Campaigns seeking to raise awareness, and to foster engagement and customer
retention are more likely to succeed with a content marketing approach than
those that seek to stimulate action through sales promotions. In the latter case,
the customer is likely to engage in a swift purchase rather than interact with
content. While content should be engaging for the audience, it should also be
designed to meet communication campaign objectives. To be effective, the
content should convey a brand’s stories, its must be interesting, communicate
brand values and reflect customer needs by providing valuable content. This is
a challenge, and content marketing efforts can have a negative effect if they are
too editorial in tone and fall into the trap of becoming ‘the creation of vague
and generic brand visions’ (Ritson 2015). Content must also be discoverable;
in other words, the content needs to get to the target audience, and this can be
achieved by using email distribution lists and SEO.
Examples of brands with different approaches to content marketing include
the following:
Digital Ocean, an infrastructure service provider, uses online tutorials
(content) to attract customers away from its large competitors. The tutorials
target digital developers and technical professionals, and the education
provided in the content adds value for these readers, who return to the
resource and also add UGC (Zomaya 2022). UGC can be highly effective,
as it creates a tone of authenticity that cannot be achieved by even the most
creative marketers. IKEA found, when it launched IkeaFamilyLive.com,
enabling its customer to upload pictures and stories of their homes, it was an
excellent source of indirect marketing material, which inspired other
marketing campaigns, such as the #ShowYourInnerShelves campaign,
which saw IKEA make connections with customers during the pandemic
and ask them to share pictures of how they organised their stuff using IKEA
furniture (Wold 2020).
P&G’s toilet roll brand Charmin ran a ‘#SitOrSquat’ campaign, which aimed
to create UGC shared across multiple platforms by sparking a conversation
about the cleanliness of public toilets. Through the brand’s bathroom app,
users could also download ‘pootastic stickers’ to share via iMessage with
friends, increasing brand awareness and engagement, and creatingbrand loyalty not only with UGC but also with every private conversation
about poop (Zomaya 2022)!
Tentsile (an outdoor equipment brand) has taken UGC a step further by
gathering a gallery of Instagram photos from customers and then adding
Tentsile tags to make the images shoppable. In this way, social commerce is
growing, as Twitter, TikTok and other social media platforms add shopping
modules to their platforms (Brzezicki 2021).
Given the importance currently placed on content marketing, many firms
develop a content marketing strategy as part of their digital marketing
planning. As with all strategies, this will involve a review of the current
approach, setting specific objectives, and developing strategies to create and
share content (Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick 2022).
Evaluation and control
Evaluation and control systems need to be created that permit management to
rapidly identify variance in actual performance versus forecast for all aspects
of the digital marketing mix. Management also requires mechanisms that
generate diagnostic guidance on the cause of any variance. To achieve this aim,
control systems should focus on the measurement of key variables within the
plan, such as targeted market share, customer attitudes, awareness objectives
for digital marketing and distribution targets. Typically, in traditional
marketing planning, measurement and control are not considered until later in
the planning process. In digital campaigns, evaluation and control are an
integral part of the objectives. While the action of setting up these measures
will not take place until the implementation stage, it is vitally important for
marketers to know how they are going to measure the achievement of
objectives, which is why this aspect is included at this stage in our discussions.
Digital analytics is a catch-all term for the methods used to evaluate the
success of digital marketing programmes. Such techniques allow the checking
of whether objectives have been achieved, by recording traffic volume,
website visitor numbers, the most popular pages and products, how long
visitors spend on the site, which pages they visit (their clickstream), referrals,
sales, and the individual sites or search terms used by visitors to find digital
content (Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick 2022). For example, Google Analytics is
an analytical tool that offers some basic-level analysis for free. Analytics tools
and techniques offer various solutions for measuring the performance of
different online digital channels. Determining which to use will be dependenton the goals set for a campaign. Refer to Figures 14.5 and 14.6 and the
description of the RACE framework above for examples of how objectives
might be measured using digital analytics.
Research has shown marketing managers often measure digital
effectiveness using criteria such as brand awareness, word of mouth, customer
satisfaction, and popular measures such as page views, cost per thousand
impressions and click-through. However, Chaffey (2021) suggests it is
important to use appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs) in a planned
manner to consider more than just volume of traffic, recommending that for
the best results it is important to determine the quality of the traffic and its
value. For example, if a firm is seeking to build a new customer base, it should
be determining the value of unique visitors. It should then be considering how
extensively visitors navigate around the site (the bounce rate), which helps to
determine the quality of the online customers. To determine the value, the
revenue per visit needs to be monitored. Finally, the firm should evaluate the
number of searches the brand is attracting.
Evaluation of digital marketing activities is also important, and so a
planner should decide which tactics might be the most effective and then
optimize (focus on) the use of specific tools and techniques. For example, a
fashion retailer like Net-a-Porter might be pursuing engagement objectives (for
its Net Set app). If this were the case, it would need to optimize its content
management strategy, contact strategy, customer service and support, mobile
marketing campaigns and social customer relationship management (CRM).
However, if a firm were following a customer acquisition strategy, it would
need to optimize its SEO, pay-per-click advertising, affiliate and partner
marketing, online public relations and social media marketing (Chaffey 2018).
As the complexity of the digital world increases, so too does the number of
tools and techniques that can be used to monitor and evaluate digital
performance. This has become a growing subject, which goes beyond the remit
of this chapter. Analytics are discussed in Chapter 6.
The successful implementation of a digital marketing campaign often
comes down to a firm’s capabilities in terms of monitoring performance and
implementing continual improvements. The quality of web analysis and
management processes will signal the extent to which a firm can expect
improvement in a digital campaign and media performance. In addition to
ensuring all the metrics and analytics associated with campaign objects are
implemented, marketers should also consider competitive advantage and
creative executions.page 579
The Dark Side of Digital Marketing
Increased adoption of digital technologies brings benefits and opportunities for
marketers. Greater and more incisive access to personal data and the online
behaviour of individuals is bring translated into greater customer choice and
convenience, and enabling all firms to compete in global markets across a
range of digital media using precision marketing techniques. However,
marketers need to consider the ethical challenges emerging from this increased
usage of digital technologies, in order to maintain a firm’s reputation and
retain a competitive position in fast-moving marketplaces (Behera et al. 2022).
Privacy and cyber security
Data privacy is a key issue as buyers and sellers interact via digital platforms.
Customers trust firms to provide secure trading environments, but lack of
personal contact can lead to uncertainty and concerns (Mourtzis et al. 2021).
Amazon has incurred large fines in Europe for breaches of GDPR regulations
in the form of cookies holding and using personal data. WhatsApp was also
fined, for not fully explaining its management of personal data and the privacy
of its messaging service (Tessian 2022). Malicious cyber attacks are largely
beyond the remit of this text, but data security is fundamental to the future
success of digital brands and online marketing campaigns. Read Hidden Gem
2.1 in Chapter 2 to find out more about how Darktrace protects its clients from
cyber attacks.
According to Shattuck (2018), there is a great temptation to deploy ruthless
tactics to increase revenues, visitor numbers and engagement online. But
Shattuck cautions firms to seek a balance between achieving hard sales
objectives and maintaining softer–and often more valuable in the longer term–
objectives like brand reputation, brand experience and protecting consumer
perceptions. Facebook’s failure to protect the privacy of its users has enabled
data to be used for political advertising and unethical campaigning. It is
claimed 87 million users had their data harvested in this political scandal. To
redress the balance and restore confidence, Facebook had to contact its 2.2billion users and explain how it would protect their privacy in the future
(Badshah 2018). The security of data exchanges between firms across the
supply chain, intermediaries and end consumers is a core issue for digital
marketers and their practices, and there are many examples of violations of
privacy laws which have resulted in unsolicited marketing communication
messages and data breaches putting firms and end consumers at risk (Lin et al.
2020).
Marketing practices: outbound digital marketing
The differences between digital and traditional media discussed at the
beginning of the chapter point us to an ethical challenge. Outbound pull
marketing is delivered by email, display ads and paid social media advertising.
When combined with programmatic ad buying the target customer is given
limited opportunity to evaluate alternative offers (once they have given their
consent to receive marketing messages); a push message sent by mass media,
on the other hand, affords the customer time for reflection before acting.
Because pull ads are time-limited, the FOMO effect can be so strong a
purchase is made instantly. The ethical issues related to outbound marketing
are increasingly being brought into question and labelled as potentially
damaging to society (Galasintu et al. 2018; Mourtizis et al. 2021).
The digital divide and social exclusion
The historical timeline of the development of internet technologies reveals
that, in the early days, the internet served highly specialized purposes and was
used by expert technologists. Expansion and changes in the development of the
web have made internet technology more accessible to a greater number of
people, but there remains a virtual divide between the technology’s ‘haves’ and
‘have nots’. Hoffman and Novak (1999) examined the extent to which the
internet has become indispensable, and found significant differences in usage
based on race and educational attainment. They concluded that educational
attainment is crucial if the digital divide is to be closed, and efforts should be
made to improve access for Hispanic and Black populations in North America
(Hoffman et al. 2004). As more digital technologies have emerged–smart
mobile phones; smart speakers, lights and other home devices; telehealth
provision; home working; and a plethora of connected devices and services–so
the digital divide has widened (Bodie and Dutta 2008; Yu et al. 2018).page 580
The Covid-19 pandemic made things worse (Li 2022), forcing people to
work and live their lives in the cocoon of their homes: shopping online,
working via videoconferencing, remote learning, and a range of social
activities from attending weddings, funerals and concerts to doing exercise.
For people without high-speed internet connections, up-to-date software and
suitable access devices, doing all of these things was difficult, leaving
individuals and families feeling left out, cut off from society and disconnected.
This situation highlighted how the gaps between technology haves and have
nots can affect health and well-being, and lead to social isolation because of
lack of access to the right technology (Watts 2020; Cho and Kim 2022; Li
2022).
Public and private organizations around the globe need to find creative
solutions to improve access to digital technologies for all citizens, regardless
of their demographic background, as they should not be deprived of internet
access due to financial restrictions, a poor education and/or a lack of computer
skills. From a commercial perspective, it is also important to acknowledge
that, while the networks forming the internet reach around the globe, access is
far from equal and equitable. There is a greater risk of social exclusion and
poorer health resulting from technological exclusion of the poorest members of
society who cannot afford a computer, broadband connection, the latest
devices, a 5G network connection or smartphone, and therefore cannot benefit
from the vast array of products and services available or access to information
sources.
However, there is also evidence of technology delivering advantages to
socially deprived sectors of society. Mobile phones have aided homeless
people by allowing them to avoid the embarrassment of not having a
permanent address by permitting them instead to give a mobile number on job
applications (Office of the Deputy Prime Minister 2005; GSMA 2018).
Human obsolescence?
Claim that technology is replacing the human workforce have occurred
throughout human history. I remember as a child being told by my teacher how
advances in technology would mean my working week would be only a few
hours and my days would be spent pursuing leisure activities. His propheciespage 581
were made more than 40 years ago, but there is now evidence, at least in part,
of machines replacing humans.
AI has facilitated a growing number of automated decision-making
systems. These can make real-time decisions based on analysis of vast
quantities of data. For example, Amazon’s Alexa is the personification of its AI
applications. With 200 million adopters of these devices since its launch in
2016, every second, hour and day, vast quantities of data are being generated,
analysed and used to improve Alexa’s capacity to serve its human owners. But
as well as enhancing human existence, sophisticated AI systems are also
replacing human decision-makers due to their capacity to collect and curate
data, analyse sentiments and then generate sophisticated analysis.
Salesforce.com has an application called Einstein, which is integrated into
its customer relationship management systems. Einstein helps businesses
identify new sales opportunities, create customer predictive journeys and
personalize customer experiences with an accuracy that outperforms human
capabilities (Salesforce.com 2018a). Einstein is enabling analysis of the causes
of customer satisfaction–an important KPI–but in a study by Salesforce.com of
more than 2,900 sales professionals, it found more than 50 per cent of
customers and businesses agree technology has changed how they interact with
sales teams.
Face-to-face sales interactions have been reduced, and AI is automating the
sales process and at the same time improving customer experiences. Data
insights from analysis of rich data are improving AI’s knowledge of customers
and their likes and dislikes. The research concluded that virtual selling is
becoming the norm (Salesforce.com 2018b). Rapid development of AI
technology and its widespread adoption is raising questions about the ethical
principles applied during development, and highlighting the need for
elimination of biases, improved fairness and greater equality (Trocin et al.
2021).Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapter
 Detailed Reviewpage 582
1. The concept of digital marketing and digital media
Digital marketing can be defined as achieving marketing objectives through
applying digital media, data and technology.
Digital media are the channels we use to communicate and interact with target
audiences online.
2. Types of digital media marketing
The application of digital technologies forms digital media channels to market and
includes:
Social media networks facilitate the sharing of ideas and information,
publishing documents and video content. Social networking is shaping the way
some sectors of society communicate. Social media cut across two forms of
media: owned and earned. A firm will ‘own’ its social media presence on
Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest, etc., but will also ‘earn’ engagement
through social media market campaigns, i.e. earning ‘likes’ and followers.
Search engine marketing optimizes search listings. From this
perspective, search is a type of paid-for digital media. Google Ads,
for example, connects a firm with new customers at the precise moment they
are looking for its products or services.
Digital display advertising is a type of paid-for media. Online, advertisers make
an investment to reach a target audience in much the same way as they would
pay for space and time in print and broadcast media, but this is a highly
complex area for marketers.
Websites are an important part of an organization’s communication strategy
and are classed as owned media. The web offers a high degree of flexibility in
terms of what can be created on a website, along with supporting digital
technologies, e.g. marketing communication platforms, e-commerce sites,
information repositories, brand portals.
Email is owned media as it is often part of a website’s features. It is now an
essential item in the direct marketing toolkit.
Mobile marketing refers to the creation and delivery of marketing
communications messages through mobile devices (phones, smartphones,
tablet computers). Like websites and email, mobile is a type of media that is
owned. Early examples of mobile marketing involved sending text messages
containing advertising to willing recipients. Messaging can be a powerful
marketing tool; WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Viber and WeChat are
examples of messaging applications.
3. Dimensions of the digital communication environment
There are four key dimensions to consider: technology (the internet, mobile and
satellite technology, remote computing, social networks, data and information
intelligent technology), applications (websites, e-commerce, social media, mobile
communications, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and robots),
marketing (globalization of markets and competition, multichannel operations,
continuous trading, remote and mobile working) and audiences (shoppers,
information searchers, businesses and community members).
4. Digital marketing planningpage 583
Deciding how to plan, resource, integrate, implement and monitor digital marketing
activities can be guided by applying established marketing management principles
and planning activities (as discussed in detail in Chapters 2 and 3). Elements of
digital marketing planning include strategic alignment, integration, value
proposition, implementation and change. Objectives and analytics are a
fundamental part of digital marketing planning, and the RACE framework provides
marketing managers with a guiding template for achieving reach (R), interactions
(act, A), sales conversions (C) and engagement (E). New technologies can be
used to meet a range of different business objectives: sales and communications,
or a focus on the development and maintenance of mutually satisfying long-term
relationships with customers by using digital technologies.
Digital marketing planning can be affected by a firm’s digital media competency.
Evaluation and control is a key consideration when setting campaign objectives.
5. Selecting a target segment for digital marketing
For marketing managers, it is increasingly important to understand their target
audiences from a digital perspective, as significant changes are taking place resulting
from more and more interactions between organizations and their audiences via
digital technology. Assessing a target segment involves considering customer
connectivity, channel usage, media consumption, digital engagement, behavioural
targeting and digital buyer behaviour.
6. Evaluation and control
Implementing a successful digital marketing campaign often comes down to a firm’s
capabilities in terms of monitoring performance and implementing continual
improvements. In addition, the quality of web analysis and management processes
will signal the extent to which a firm can expect an improvement in digital campaign
and media performance. Creating competitive advantage and managing creative
content are key to campaign success. Evaluation and control systems should identify
variance in actual performance versus forecast for all aspects of the digital marketing
mix. Management also requires mechanisms that generate diagnostic guidance on
the cause of any variance.
7. The dark side of digital marketing
Increased adoption of digital technologies within marketing has had
many beneficial effects, such as increasing customer choice and convenience, and
enabling smaller firms to compete in global markets across a range of digital
platforms. However, key ethical issues emerging as a result of increased usage of
digital technologies include cyber security, the digital and social divide, and human
obsolescence. The Covid-19 pandemic revealed the widening of the digital divide.

CASE 27
NETFLIX: USING BIG DATA
TO SUCCEED
Introduction
Netflix is often hailed as the king of streaming services, with 220.7 million subscribers as of the
second quarter of 2022 (Deggans 2022). Founded in August 1997 by two serial entrepreneurs,
Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings, the streaming service started out by shipping DVDs to
customers by post. With the passage of time, Netflix moved into streaming movies and TV
shows, and even began producing its own unique content, which has proved hugely popular
(Anon 2022). It has now grown to become one of the world’s leading entertainment platforms.
For millions, Netflix is now the de facto place to go for movie and TV streaming (McFadden
2020).
Netflix engaged in years of seemingly unstoppable growth as it revolutionized the way people
around the world consumed entertainment (Sherman and Clayton 2022). It now consumes
more than 15 per cent of the world’s bandwidth and has subscribers in more than 190 countries
(Kariuki 2022). Netflix has always been a customer-centric organization. It offers consumers
great flexibility, allowing them to watch any content on demand, any time, anywhere. It provides
customers with a variety of options, ranging from TV programmes to movies and
documentaries. It has also invested in creating original content and offers consumers an ad￾free experience. In addition, it provides customers with a personalized experience, analysing
customer data to create a detailed profile of its subscribers and using predictive analytics to fuel
its recommendations system (Anon 2022).
Data Analyticspage 589
Netflix is a data-driven subscription service business model. It offers personalized
recommendations to its customers, and data analytics has been key to its success. Netflix
collects and mines vast quantities of data using a variety of techniques. Data are gathered and
manipulated to provide valuable business intelligence and to aid decision-making. Big data are
integral to better decision-making, revealing patterns and interesting anomalies, with the
potential to provide new insights into customer behaviour. Netflix uses a multi-tiered data
architecture and common data platform to gather, store and process massive amounts of data,
and gain insights that influence its decisions on what content to create and promote to viewers.
In particular, it uses data-processing software and traditional business intelligence tools such as
Hadoop and Teradata, as well as its own open-source solutions (Giordano 2019).
Netflix’s official privacy statement outlines the data it holds about its users and what happens to
the data. The type of data collected by Netflix includes specific data about the customer. Users
are asked for personal details like name, email address, home address, payment method and
telephone number. Netflix also stores data, such as when subscribers give content a star rating
or post a review. This type of data can provide valuable information that will help it improve its
offering. Netflix also collects data automatically, such as which platform is used (e.g.
smartphone, tablet, smart TV). Data on the customer’s IP address, watch history, search
queries and how long they have watched shows are also automatically collected (Saltzman
2022). Web browser activity is also used to collect meaningful data. This type of data helps
Netflix understand what people want. It has always been a customer-centric organization and
its use of data warehousing and data mining to examine past and current activity means it can
make accurate recommendations based on specific customer activity and not best guesses.
Mining through the data generates interesting correlations, patterns, clusters and sequences,
which are used to aid decision-making and enable Netflix to accurately target customers with
exactly what they are interested in.
Similar to other companies, once logged in to Netflix from a web browser, web history data are
collected using cookies, web beacons and advertising identifiers. Netflix uses online interest￾based advertising to target users with its ads on other websites and apps. It is finding clever
ways to work with brands to target customers based on their interests. For instance, Netflix
worked with sandwich chain Subway to offer a Green Eggs and Ham Sub (spinach-dyed eggs,
sliced ham, guacamole and cheese) tied to the Netflix series Green Eggs & Ham, based on the
Dr Seuss book of the same name (Hsu 2019). As video streaming hits continue to expand,
Netflix partnerships will offer yet more ways to link with brands like Subway and
Coca-Cola to connect with fans around the world (as demonstrated in the case of
hit Netflix series Stranger Things and the prominence of Coca-Cola).
Netflix also uses data from other sources, both online and offline data providers, as is common
practice in the entertainment industry. Data collected by Netflix include demographic data,
internet browsing behaviour, topics of interest, and so on (Saltzman 2022). Ranking high on
search results is essential. The streaming giant controls more than 12 per cent of the world’s
web traffic (Guzovsky 2021). Search engines convert website content into quantifiable data. It is
because of big data that search engine optimization (SEO) applies different techniques, such
as keywords, on-page optimization and linking, to reach out to customers–all this happens
because of big data.
Improving Customer-facing Communication
Netflix has managed to successfully use the big data it collects not only to create a better user
experience for customers, but also to communicate more effectively. For example, email is a
core component of Netflix’s communication strategy: it is used to welcome subscribers to thestreaming platform as part of the registration process; Netflix then segments users into groups,
and provides content recommendations and relevant updates based on their preferences.
Emails are highly personalized, using subscriber data drawn from the platform (IO 2022). It
continues to draw in subscribers by offering recommendations based on past content viewed.
Emails include GIFs and moving images to grab subscribers’ attention; these can be promoted
on social media (Egan 2018).
Social media is also an important element of the company’s communication strategy and Netflix
engages its audience through numerous social media platforms. As of July 2022, it had 92
million Facebook followers, 19.6 million Twitter followers, 30 million followers on Instagram and
26.9 million on TikTok; Netflix has a clear idea of what they are doing on social media. Its main
strategy is to entertain fans not just through movies and TV shows but also through witty social
media content. It listens to what its audience is saying and curates content that best resonates
with them (Ramakrishnan 2019).
Netflix has designed its website with a user-friendly interface that allows customers to rate TV
shows and movies; this information then goes through Netflix’s algorithm so that it can
recommend more content viewers might enjoy. It has optimized each and every page on its
website to provide an enhanced customer experience, and successfully uses SEO to improve
its visibility in organic search results and to establish its brand presence (Menghani 2022). In
addition, Netflix uses in-app personalized push notifications to alert users when new episodes
of their favourite series are released, or to get them thinking about what they can watch next
(Lam 2020).
Netflix is a textbook example of how big data can be leveraged to improve customer-facing
communications.
The Future
Despite the success of Netflix, the streaming service has been dealing with many challenges.
Although its position as a global giant was cemented when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020–
which saw people locked down at home flocking to Netflix for entertainment–as pre-pandemic
habits returned, Netflix struggled to attract new sign-ups and maintain the loyalty of its existing
members, especially as the rising cost of living led many people to cut back on expenses
(Sherman and Clayton 2022). In early 2022, it lost 700,000 subscribers when it pulled out of
Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. The drop-off in subscribers dovetailed with broader
viewership declines as the pandemic restrictions receded and customers found other
entertainment options. In the second quarter of 2022, Netflix announced it had lost almost a
million subscribers, representing the biggest subscriber loss in the company’s history. The good
news was that this was far less than the two million subscriber loss the company had predicted
(Telford and Jeong 2022). For some this record decline in subscribers is seen as a sign the
company may be in trouble. Netflix itself blames it on increasing competition and subscribers
engaging in password-sharing (Inskeep and Allyn 2022). Rivals such as Disney+, Apple TV,
Hulu, HBO, Amazon Prime Video and Paramount+ appear to be challenging Netflix’s
dominance. In fact in August 2022, Disney’s streaming service overtook Netflix in terms of
number of viewers (Mellar 2022).
Meanwhile, price hikes are taking a toll on subscription levels and Netflix’s move to make its
service more expensive has put off some customers. In the UK, for example, the price of both
basic and standard Netflix plans increased in January 2022 by £1 a month, to £6.99 and £10.99
respectively. Some see price hikes as a risky strategy, as consumers now have additional
choice when it comes to streaming services. Netflix recently announced new initiatives it hopes
will help it deal with its current difficulties, and boost sales and subscribers. These effortspage 590
include cracking down on password-sharing and introducing a lower-priced tier with ads
(Pallotta 2022). It is estimated that password-sharing costs Netflix £6 billion a year. The
streaming giant is already charging more for sharing accounts in some countries in Central and
South America, and it hopes to replicate this model around the world (Sherman and Clayton
2022). It is also aiming to win over value-conscious consumers and help turn
around declining subscriber numbers by introducing the new ad-supported
streaming package mentioned above, set to debut in early 2023. Developed in partnership with
Microsoft, this new ad-supported tier may help attract new subscribers, but the fear is it will
negatively effect the Netflix customer experience and drive consumers to other streaming
service providers (Business Standard 2022). These recent initiatives are undoubtedly good for
Netflix’s bottom line, but they aren’t necessarily what customers are clamouring for. That could
become an issue as the company attempts to simultaneously attract new users, reduce churn
and make money (Pallotta 2022). Despite the challenging times ahead, Netflix continues to do
what it does best: use big data analytics to optimize the overall quality of its service and the
user experience. After a long reign as king of streaming, Netflix faces a tough fight to keep its
crown. Key to this may be finding new ways of using big data to grow its customer base.

THE HAPPY PEAR: GO
WITH YOUR GUT!
Introduction
This case study focuses on The Happy Pear’s adoption of tribal marketing strategies in gaining
a vibrant and passionate community of like-minded followers for its various products and
services, including its cafés, sea-swimming groups, podcasts and lifestyle programmes. This
case study focuses on the development of tribal marketing, and the process of developing a
loyal community of followers and advocates with shared values, lifestyles and interests. Tribal
marketing focuses on the growth of online lifestyle communities, whereby more and more
consumers are embracing a vegan diet and healthier lifestyle. This case highlights the
effectiveness of the synergistic impacts of social media platforms, which has culminated in the
success of The Happy Pear in Ireland and the UK.

The Happy Pear was founded by twins David and Stephen Flynn in 2004 when they opened a
small vegan store in a village called Greystones in County Wicklow on the east coast of Ireland.
The success of the store was followed by the addition of a wholefood café, a farm, a health￾food product range and a coffee roastery. Over the course of 18 years, they have developed 60
products, published six international bestselling cookbooks, opened additional cafés and
developed a suite of online courses. They have amassed a community of more than one millionpage 592
followers via their various social media platforms, which include Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook,
Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. The Happy Pear’s (offline and online) community of like￾minded followers, who share the business’s values, includes thousands of people from more
than 50 countries, who have taken part in its online courses (The Happy Pear 2022a).
The Happy Pear YouTube channel has more than 531,000 subscribers (The Happy Pear
2022b). Vegan recipe videos are uploaded on a weekly basis and are complementary to The
Happy Pear’s bestselling cookbooks and healthy vegan food product line, which is available in
Ireland and the UK. The Happy Pear webpage has generated a dedicated community group
who are passionate about health and wellness not just through following a wholefood, plant￾based diet, but also by embracing a healthier lifestyle. Online courses include ‘The Gut Health
Revolution’, ‘The Happy Pear Alcohol Free Challenge’, gut health recipes, ‘The Happy Shape
Course’ and ‘The Happy Heart Course’.
The twins are active advocates of sea swimming and regularly invite their community of
followers to their ‘swimrise’ events in the Irish Sea at Greystones, as well inviting other coastal
groups to host their own daily dips. The twins host a podcast, which is in its sixth season, where
they explore lots of lifestyle health and wellness ideas with a variety of guests ranging from
chefs, doctors and athletes to artists, musicians and poets. The twins also offer corporate
health and well-being packages (virtual and in person), and have worked with companies such
as Facebook, Microsoft, Pinterest, Google and Mastercard. The Happy Pear community
includes people embracing health and wellness, young parents who wish to embrace veganism
in their family unit, foodies and people who are interested in sustainability. The
dynamic between the twins works well, with David admitting that Stephen is the
better chef, while Stephen considers David to be the better writer (Butler 2020). In a podcast
interview with Dr Louise Newson, discussing the importance of building a community and
environment that helps individuals make healthier choices, Steve has maintained, ‘at the root of
it [The Happy Pear business ethos] is the same dream of trying to create health and happiness
and build community. And… more than ever… community is more of what we all need’ (Newson
2022).

Juggling Business Interests and Healthy Lifestyle
AdvocacyThe twins are healthy lifestyle advocates as well as business operators, which can often involve
some juggling and is something that can pose challenges for most SMEs. In 2021, the twins
had to make the tough decision to close four of their cafés and restaurants, and post-Covid they
are continuously challenged with regular business dilemmas, coupled with the responsibility of
employing around 100 people. In 2019 and 2020, the company had to reorganize, restructure
and rationalize its business. However, it has now turned the corner and increased its revenue
thanks to online courses and consumers evolving to a more plant-based diet. Furthermore, the
company is in the process of launching a new mobile app–The Happy Pear App–which will
encompass its courses, recipes and podcasts, and host the community in a more accessible
way (Deegan 2021).
As the years have passed, The Happy Pear’s message has softened a little and the twins admit
that they no longer see things in binary terms regarding their vegetarian versus non-vegetarian
stance (Meehan 2021). They recognize their role in encouraging a healthy lifestyle and people
following a predominantly plant-based diet, high in fibre and wholefoods, which is non￾processed. The Happy Pear liaises regularly with a variety of specialists in the fields of sports
science, nutrition, medicine, and so on, for its programmes (such as ‘The Happy Heart’ and
‘The Happy Gut’), developing its own podcasts as well as contributing to other podcasts (BBC
Good Food 2021), and the various offline and online initiatives and courses it is running. The
twins have presented to doctors at the LSE (London School of Economics), and given a variety
of presentations to schools and at corporate events. The Happy Pear works with supermarket
chains in Ireland and the UK (almost 1,000 stores) and has developed a range of ready meals,
as well as developing and maintaining a biodiverse farm run by the twins’ brother.
The Duality of Social Media
The twins have developed a strong presence on various social media platforms and effectively
disseminated their ethos, extending their community of followers globally, which has
consequently seen the business thrive thanks to these media. However, as is widely accepted,
there are dual aspects to social media, and the brothers have had to contend with their fair
share of negativity and toxicity. The twins acknowledge that as they have matured and the
longer they have been in the business, they have become a little less sensitive to negative
comments. However, they try to manage their relationship with their followers and all
commentators on online platforms so they don’t get too affected by negativity. The twins accept
‘we’re some people’s kombucha, but we’re not everyone’s cup of tea’ (Moloney 2021).
Staying In Your Lane
The twins have described themselves as ‘Marmite’ but say they are no longer worried about
‘pear-fection’ and appealing to everyone. In April 2022, the twins were criticized by some
medics for suggesting in an Instagram reel that eating mushrooms and soy products could stop
people getting breast cancer. In a since deleted video, the twins claimed ‘some of the possible
factors that contributed to breast cancer included excessive saturated fat intake, excessive
dairy product intake and excessive animal product intake’. The video was debunked by
physicist and cancer specialist Dr David Robert Grimes and breast cancer surgeon Dr Liz
O’Riordan, who pointed out there is no clear evidence that avoiding dairy will impact cancer risk
(McDonnell 2022).
Organizations such as the Irish Cancer Society advised people to source information on the
disease from reliable sources, with its director of advocacy and external affairs, Rachel
Morrogh, stating that the majority of cancers occur for reasons outside of anyone’s control, andpage 593
that ‘while maintaining a healthy and balanced diet can help to reduce cancer risk, there is no
strong evidence that consuming one particular food or food group reduces the risk of cancer’
(Neville 2022). The twins later apologized via a jointly recorded video on various social media
platforms for making the claims, and the attendant media storm seems not to have negatively
impacted their loyal community of followers (Thornton 2022).
In June 2020, The Happy Pear twins had a joint opportunity to discuss their new cookbook, The
Veg Box, on The Ray D’Arcy Show, a primetime national radio show in Ireland (RTE Radio
2022), and used the interview as an opportunity to apologize for ‘not staying in their lane’ (i.e.
not sticking to their own area of expertise) and for any upset caused by their advice (Brennan
2022). They acknowledged it had been a difficult and challenging time but also allowed them
the opportunity to reflect and be more responsible with their observations and advice (Mulgrew
2022), with their mission remaining the same: ‘To create a healthier happier world and build
community!’
Conclusion
Evidently, The Happy Pear has evolved from idealists who initially focused purely on a vegan
diet to advocates of a more holistic, healthy and sustainable lifestyle. Their journey has been a
deeply personal one that has contended with the evolution of lifestyle, medicine, digital media
expansion, ongoing business challenges–and a global pandemic. Undoubtedly their following
remains strong, as the twins’ authenticity and vulnerability, as well as their maturity, has shone
through in their ongoing efforts to create, build and maintain a healthier and happier community
(Doctor’s Kitchen 2021).
Questions
1. Describe tribal marketing and explain why it has become a phenomenon in recent years. Do
you consider it is purely based on trends? Why, or why not?
2. Discuss how organizations can use marketing analytics to inform goal-setting and strategy
evaluation, particularly in establishing marketing objectives and performance measurement.
3. The Happy Pear refers to generating and sustaining a ‘sense of community’. How can it
continue to achieve this, based on how much the business has grown?

irect marketing communications are evolving rapidly. Digital and mobile
communication platforms are blurring the boundaries between
communication tools media. Websites, social media and mobile apps
carry text, audio and video messages as well as acting as information sources,
means of data collection and sales channels (Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick
2022). In this chapter, we explore the elements of the promotional mix
considered direct forms of communication. The chapter begins by looking at
direct marketing, then considers how social media is used for directcommunication, followed by personal selling and sales management, and
finally we’ll consider exhibitions and trade fairs. Now read Hidden Gem 15.1
to see whether the ultimate marketing experience is a social virtual world.

Horizon Worlds: A Very Direct Marketing Landscape?
In 2020, when Mark Zuckerberg announced Horizon Worlds, a virtual environment where
users can ‘explore, play, create with others in VR’, he certainly was suggesting he intended
to do things differently. The new landscape offers a virtual immersive experience, inviting
users to make connections between people, places and communities in a digital reality
environment. People enter this virtual place and can party together, work, shop and
socialize using an avatar.

The metaverse’s offer is different, as it is an experience not a browsing environment, where
people become proactively engaged with others, with games, activities and brands using
AR and VR digital technology. It is perhaps this shift in focus that offers so much potential to
marketers. It’s digital virgin territory, a mirror of the physical world, where immense
opportunities may be created for individuals, businesses, governments and society. This
new place, where consumers and businesses can connect, interact, trade in
cryptocurrencies in real time, is still to be defined as it emerges and grows.
The biggest questions for direct marketers are will Horizon Worlds be the next go-to place
to interact directly with target customers, will other worlds be created or will it eventually
disappear into the annals of internet history, like the information superhighway and
cyberspace, where dotcoms and netizens were created and destined to live on the net?
Marketing in the metaverse offers a new environment, with new promotional tools, and it
already has access to a vast audiences of more than 400 million Gen Zers and millennials.
But there are hurdles to overcome–the immersive experience is still a work in progress.page 597
Meta Platforms, Inc. (formerly Facebook, Inc.) has built the first metaverse-themed store at
the Burlingame campus in California. The first visitors to be invited were content creators
and social media ambassadors, and they gave their virtual experience the thumbs up while
trying on Ray-Ban smart glasses, which allow users to ‘capture, share and listen like never
before’. Through the glasses, wearers can capture video as they walk, record voice audio
and then export their stories seamlessly onto social media. But while the glasses combine
with the metaverse they are yet to offer AR and VR technology, so the promised immersive
experience is limited. And there are other challenges for Zuckerberg:
New market entrants: Many other firms have ideas about creating their own
metaverses–Apple, Google, Disney, Nvidia, Microsoft and Coca-Cola are a few
examples. Microsoft paid $68.7 million to acquire Activision Blizzard, a producer of
popular gaming software, with ambitions to boost its own metaverse through established
digital gaming communities. In 2021, gaming platform Roblox and luxury brand Gucci
together created the Gucci Garden, which allowed Roblox users to explore the House of
Gucci. Appearing as a natural mannequin, they wandered through rooms and
experienced spaces in an individualized way. Visitors could dress their mannequin in
exclusive virtual Gucci items and purchase limited-edition items for their avatars. Gucci
claims to want to empower individuals in new virtual territories.
The definition and function of the metaverse is not yet clear. It may be a 3D immersive
environment where users can interact on multiple platforms, but is this a rerun of
Second Life’s virtual world? This venture largely failed because it was difficult to use and
consequently did not attract a mass market. However, consumers are different now,
more digitally savvy and conversant with how to operate in digital environment than they
were in 2003 when Second Life launched.
User resistance: To enjoy AR and VR environments, users need new equipment. Meta
has VR headsets, Apple plans to release AR glasses and Microsoft has HoloLens VR
headsets, but all are in the early stages of development and may prove to be an
expensive barrier to enjoying the immersive experience and thereby limit market appeal.
Despite the challenges, there are significant opportunities and Meta Platforms, Inc. aims for
Horizon Worlds and the metaverse to be the next big thing in computing platforms, and has
billions of dollars to invest to make it happen. The speed of technology development and
the digital skills of younger target market segments may be the boost the environment
needs to bring this new marketing environment to life and, if it does, will open up a plethora
of new marketing spaces, where direct virtual marketing can flourish in ways yet to be
imagined.

Communications
Direct marketing is an effective means of communicating with consumer and
business audiences, using methods that attempt to acquire, retain and convert
customers and build relationships. These types of campaigns are designed to
stimulate an immediate response from the recipient. A key advantage of direct
marketing is campaigns are easier to measure than those using mass￾communication tools, and therefore it is easier to determine the effectiveness
of campaigns.
Direct marketing campaigns are not short-term, response-driven activities.
Increasingly, firms are using direct marketing methods to develop ongoing
direct personal relationships with customers (Key and Czaplewski 2017), as
marketers believe the cost of attracting new customers is five times that of
retaining existing customers. Direct marketing techniques can be used
effectively as part of an IMC campaign and create opportunities for retaining
customers and selling more products using cross-selling (encouraging the
purchase of a wider range of products) and upselling (encouraging the
purchase of higher-value products). Direct marketing covers a wide array of
techniques, each of which offers a marketing manager a set of potential
benefits and limitations to consider when planning an IMC campaign. Direct
marketing is a major component of the promotional mix, enabling the precise
targeting of consumers and the requesting of an immediate direct response.
Originally, this communication method mainly involved direct mail and mail￾order catalogues, but today’s direct marketers use a wide range of media,
including telemarketing, direct response advertising and digital media.
Figure 15.1 shows the main techniques used for direct marketing. Each is
discussed below. Social media is explored separately later in the chapter.

Direct mail
Direct mailings are addressed to the target consumer (or business), and may
include promotions, invitations, discounts, coupons, catalogues and other
informative content. Spend on this form of communication is increasing
annually, making it the third-largest method of communication after online and
television. It is a form of marketing that is becoming increasingly effective at
reaching younger audience (15–24 year olds), who are willing to respond to
mail ads and scan QR codes. PrettyLittleThing and boohoo are two online
brands successfully using direct methods of marketing.
Direct mail can be used to meet different marketing communication
objectives, from creating brand awareness to eliciting action. Campaigns often
involve sending highly creative mailshots to capture the recipient’s attention. A
requirement when moving from mass marketing to mass customization
communications is effective database management, which
enables marketers to achieve greater accuracy with targeting theirpage 599
direct mailing campaigns at individuals. Moreover, a study by WARC (Bowler
2021) suggested direct mail offers firms a better return on their investment on
marketing spend if included in the marketing communications mix. These
findings prompted Royal Mail, which works with brands to build target
markets using direct mail, to develop strategies using data analytics to run a
campaign to change marketers’ perceptions of direct mail. The campaign
suggested direct marketing could turn abandoned baskets–a major problem
online–into personalized direct mailings, which would deliver much better
returns. By using programmatic mail to connect to customers, Royal Mail
offers to help brands create highly personalized mailshots. This direct mailing
brings customers back to the online environment, with their own personalized
incentives in the form of vouchers and codes, and triggers the action required.
This is an example of how direct mail is influencing buyer behaviour (Royal
Mail 2022a, 2022b), with many different brands–not just retail brands–now
increasingly using this form of communication.
Direct mail is an engaging form of communication, which if used correctly
can deliver better-performing results than other forms of marketing. According
to Marketreach (2022c), there is a variety of styles that can be applied. For
example:
Direct mail is addressed to a named person, offers precise targeting and
helps build customer relationships. It requires accurate customer data and
effective database management. Examples include Sky, BT, Hive, KitKat
and JD Williams.
Partially addressed mail uses postcodes to target a selected area, enabling
firms to reach new customers without having all of their personal details.
Rather than a named addressee, more generic terms like ‘Dear Gardening
Lover’ and ‘Dear Delicious Baker’ are used to attract the attention of the
homeowner. Examples include Subway and McCarthy Stone.
Door drops are used by large and small local and national businesses to post
flyers, leaflets and brochures through the letterbox. These campaigns are not
personalized, and can be effective for raising awareness and triggering
action. Examples include Costco, RSPCA, Movember Foundation.
Customer mail–slightly different to direct mail, its targets are actual
customers of a business, and the communication may include a bill,
statement or other official notification as well as the marketing message.
Can be a highly effective method as there is an existing level of
trust between customer and brand. Examples include Lloyds Bank,
Pets at Home, Homebase and Lakeland.Catalogues offer an opportunity to shop a deep range of products;
catalogues and brochures provide details and information on a range of
products, are useful for targeting people in their homes and facilitating
online shopping. Examples include Joe Browns, Marshalls and Not On The
High Street.
Firms and organizations across different sectors use direct mail marketing.
For example, Thames Water ran a successful direct mail campaign designed to
inform customers about a complex behavioural change. It wanted to get over
the message to ‘Bin it–don’t block it’, to stop water pipes becoming blocked
with fat and grease poured down drains (Hemsley 2018). The Salvation Army
wanted to recruit new donors and launched an integrated multichannel
campaign using TV, mail and online. The results were cold mail volume
increased 270 per cent and door drops 158 per cent, with the campaign
succeeding in delivering results, bringing in new donors and increasing
involvement from existing donors. Julius Wolff-Ingham, head of marketing
and fundraising at the charity, said, ‘we have diversified and expanded our
appeals… [and] the ways in which people respond have changed too, but mail
is still our anchor medium to put the Salvation Army visibly on the doormat of
many millions of homes each year’ (Marketreach 2022b). Fred. Olsen Travel
wanted to raise brand awareness among a targeted 55+ audience at peak travel￾booking time of year. It produced a full-colour catalogue that was door￾dropped, and included a prize draw to act as an action trigger for customers to
respond online or contact their call centre. The ROI of the campaign
investment was a 107 per cent increase in bookings (Marketreach 2022a).
Direct response advertising
Direct response advertising is designed to elicit an immediate response,
encouraging consumers to take action, and can appear in print, on television
and online. This method is increasingly used online, where campaigns capture
attention and then lead customers to a webpage where they can take the
desired action. Direct response advertising is a highly measurable form of
communication. Also, because the advert requires action, it enables the
advertiser to gather information about the customer. This forms a direct
connection with the customer, which can be utilized to enable the sending of
highly personalized messages, helps to build longer-term relationships, and can
be used on all different forms of media: broadcast, print and digital. ‘Buy this’
and ‘shop now’ are examples of triggers used to encourage instant action, butobjectives can also be to encourage customers to read a post on an online
platform or sign up to a newsletter. These are also forms of direct response
advertising.
Email marketing
Email marketing is important for building and maintaining close customer
relationships, and this mode of direct marketing has been widely adopted as a
means of distributing promotional messages and offers (as also discussed in
Chapter 14). Once established, this is a low-cost method for distributing
discounts, coupons, sales promotions and vouchers. Care should be taken to
gain the end customer’s permission to send email marketing messages by
inviting them to opt in to receive messages and promotions. Unsolicited emails
(spam) are largely illegal these days and if received tend to be deleted,
especially if the recipient is unaware of the identity of the message sender. One
of the major challenges for email marketing campaigns is to get the intended
recipient to open the mailing rather than just delete the message. Ellis￾Chadwick and Doherty (2012) found executional tactics that could enhance the
likelihood of success. For instance, securing a recipient’s attention depends on
whether the subject line of the email is attention grabbing and relevant. Also
important is the sender; if a recipient perceives the email is from an unknown
or unwanted source, they will delete it rather than open it. To develop
sustained attention, the message should be personally relevant to the recipient
and have interactive content to engage further interest. Personalized messages
can enhance performance, but recipients will have had to pass through the opt￾in permission stage first. PayPal regularly uses email campaigns to send
personalized and targeted messages. Using financial, timed incentives
increases customer engagement.
Outbound email marketing occurs when mailings are sent by firms once
they have built an email list of ‘opted in’ customers; it is designed to
encourage sales, raise brand awareness, build customer relationships, foster
audience engagement and generate leads (DMA 2020).
Online newsletters are a form of marketing that tends to focus on a specific
set of issues or interests. Items can be sent at different frequencies and serve
different communication objectives. Online newsletters and magazines form an
important element of content marketing strategies, and often include user￾generated content (UGC, see Chapter 14) depending on whether a firm is
telling its customers about a brand or conversing with them.page 600
Coupons
Coupons are a marketing tool used to acquire customers and encourage trial of
new products and services. Price promotions form an important tactic here and
are the main motivation for customers to redeem coupons. Traditionally
coupons were printed, but now the use of electronic and mobile versions is
widespread (Leva et al. 2018). Greater use of electronic formats has also
changed tactical motivations. Increasingly, ‘deal of the day’ offers are used to
engage customers. Research has found younger consumers will purchase a
deal of the day motivated by both rational (price) and hedonic (enjoyment)
drivers (Leva et al. 2018). For marketers, this opens up opportunities to
develop creative campaigns that can enhance the value proposition and make
the redemption of coupons an exciting and enjoyable experience for the
consumer.
For example, Groupon (Exhibit 15.1) is a successful online brand that
connects consumers with coupons, cashback, sales giveaways and promotional
codes from local businesses. The brand operates in 15 countries and has nearly
26 million users, who visit its web and mobile sites to find the best deals.
Firms benefiting from this approach are many and varied, from Paradise
Wildlife Park, which used Groupon to sell 40,000 tickets during bad weather,
to Lorena Oberg Skincare, which upsells to 70 per cent of its Groupon
customers (Groupon 2022).

Direct selling
Direct selling offers a sales channel that operates without a fixed location,
makes use of personal contact and is big business. Billions of dollars of
revenue are generated each year from a diverse range of products and services,
including cosmetics, cleaning products, nutritional products and homewares
(Ferrell and Ferrell 2012). This method of direct marketing relies on a seller’s
network of contacts to generate leads through which products can be promoted
(Ponder 2011). Social media have added a new dimension to this form of
selling, as it extends the reach and diversity of personal networks. The
opportunities are further enhanced by the use of smartphones. Digital
technology and social media networks are creating opportunities not only to
find new customers but also to recruit new advocates (Ferrell and Ferrell
2012).
For example, Avon, the cosmetics and jewellery brand, uses direct selling
via a catalogue (printed and online). Avon representatives sell products door to
door through their networks. To stay relevant, the brand is finding ways to use
digital advertising channels and social media to expand (Trefis Team 2018).
Telemarketing
Telemarketing makes use of the phone to sell goods and services to target
customers. There are two types:
1. inbound, where the customer contacts the firm, and the customer may
consider this type of telemarketing to be part of the service offer
2. outbound, where the firm contacts the customer, which is often perceived as
a nuisance–customers can become aggressive when they receive calls they
are not expecting.
There is also a downside for employees making outbound calls, as they
experience the negative attitudes of customers. Absenteeism and low morale
are high in outbound telemarketing call centres (Maulana and Nurulfirdausi
2015).
Despite the issues associated with managing a campaign, telemarketing is a
versatile approach and can be used to support other forms of direct marketing,
for example to follow up on sales leads generated from online campaigns,page 601
establish contact with customers and provide customer sales support. It is a
relatively low-cost and effective means of interacting with target customers.
Regal Fish, for example, is a firm that uses telemarketing very effectively
to deliver freshly caught seafood direct to homes across the UK from its base
in Barton-upon-Humber. By using customer referrals and
telemarketing, the firm has built a customer base of 80,000 to
whom it regularly delivers, making 1,000 delivery rounds each year.
Care should be taken to ensure calls are not perceived as aggressive, and
the frequency of calls should be managed. If a customer feels they are being
hounded by telemarketing calls, this can create negative brand associations.
Direct Marketing Campaigns
Direct marketing is no longer synonymous with junk mail, as it is a suite of
communication techniques that are an integral part of the relationship
marketing concept, where firms attempt to establish ongoing direct and
profitable relationships with customers. As with all marketing
communications, direct marketing campaigns should be integrated both within
themselves and with other communication tools such as advertising, publicity
and personal selling. Uncoordinated communication leads to blurring of brand
positioning and customer confusion.
Direct marketing is growing in popularity as a communication tool in both
consumer and industrial markets, based on several different drivers.
Market and media fragmentation has meant the effectiveness of mass￾marketing techniques (e.g. using television and other broadcast media) has
declined as the requirement to reach target segments with highly
individualized needs has increased. Consequently, the importance of direct
marketing media that can not only target specialized niche markets but also
distribute highly personalized appeals has grown. Direct response
advertising is more effective, since market niches can be tightly targeted,
and this approach is used extensively online.
Technological advances have led to the increasing sophistication of
software, allowing the generation of personalized letters and telephone
scripts, and enabling direct marketers to develop highly targeted and
sophisticated campaigns. Databases and data warehouses hold detailed
information on individuals and businesses and, once analysed, this enhancestargeting. Customer relationship management software has enabled firms to
manage one-to-one relationships with huge numbers of consumers.
Automated telephone systems make it possible to handle dozens of calls
simultaneously, reducing the risk of losing potential customers.
Furthermore, developments in technology in telephone, cable/satellite
television and the internet have triggered a rise in home-based electronic
shopping.
Emerging analytical techniques mean that, by using geodemographic
analysis, households can be classified into a neighbourhood type (e.g.
‘modern private housing, young families’, ‘private flats, single people’).
These in turn can be cross-referenced with product usage, media usage and
lifestyle statements to create market segments that can be targeted by direct
mail (see Chapter 7 for a more detailed discussion).
Marketing databases
The marketing database is central to direct marketing as activities depend on
customer information. A marketing database holds customer data, such as
names, addresses, telephone numbers, and lifestyle and transactional data.
Information such as types of purchase, frequency of purchase, purchase value
and responsiveness to promotional offers may be held. Using the marketing
database, firms can take an interactive approach towards developing highly
targeted direct communication campaigns using individually addressable
marketing media and channels (such as mail, telephone and the sales force) to
provide information to a target audience.
Some key characteristics of marketing databases are that, first, they allow
direct communication with customers through a variety of media, including
direct mail, telemarketing, direct response advertising and digital media
channels. Second, they usually require the customer to respond in a way that
allows the firm to act (such as through contact by telephone, sending out
literature or arranging sales visits). Third, this type of marketing
communication is traceable and measurable.
Sophisticated databases provide the capability of storing and analysing
large quantities of data from diverse sources, and presenting information in a
convenient, accessible and useful format. The creation of a database relies on
the systematic collection and storage of information. Table 15.1 shows
examples of basic sources and types of data.page 602

Typical information stored in a database
Perhaps the most important thing to acknowledge about a marketing database
is that it is a systematic way of gathering data that can be collated and analysed
to provide information that has implications for marketing campaigns. Figure
15.2 shows typical information recorded in a database.
FIGURE 15.2page 603
A marketing database
Customer and prospect information
This provides the basic data required to access customers and prospects (e.g.
name, home and email addresses, telephone number), and details on their
general behavioural characteristics (e.g. psychographic and behavioural data).
For organizational markets, information on key decision-makers and
influencers, and the choice criteria they use, would also be stored.
Transactional information
Past transactions are a key indicator of likely future transactions. Transactional
data must be sufficiently detailed to allow FRAC (frequency, recency, amount
and category) information to be extracted for each customer:
Frequency refers to how often a customer buys. Both the average frequency
and the trend (is the customer tending to buy frequently?) is of use to the
direct marketer.
Recency measures when the customer last bought. If customers are waiting
longer before they rebuy (i.e. recency is increasing), the reasons for this
(e.g. less attractive offers or service problems) need to be explored.
Amount measures how much a customer has bought and is usually recorded
in value terms. Analysis of this data may reveal that 20 per cent of
customers are accounting for 80 per cent of the value of transactions.Finally, category defines the type of product being bought. Cross-analysing
category data with type of customer (e.g. geodemographics or lifestyle data)
can reveal the customer profile most likely to buy a product. Also,
promotions can be targeted at those individuals known to be interested in
buying from a product category.
Promotional information
This covers information on what promotional campaigns have been run, who
has responded to them, and what the overall results were in terms of contacts,
sales and profits. The database will contain information on which customers
were targeted, and the media and contact strategy employed.
Product information
This information would include which products have been promoted, who
responded, when and from where.
Geodemographic information
Information about the geographic locations of customers and prospects, and
the social, lifestyle or business category they belong to, is stored. By including
postcodes in the addresses of customers and employing the services of an
agency such as Acorn, which conducts geodemographic analysis, a customer
profile can be built up. Direct mail could then be targeted at people with
similar geodemographic profiles.
The main application of marketing databases
Marketing databases have the following uses:
Developing targeted direct marketing campaigns: For example, a special
offer on garden tools from a mail-order firm could be targeted at those
people who have purchased gardening products in the past. Another
example is a car dealer that, by holding a database of customers’ names and
addresses, and dates of car purchase, could use direct mail to promote
service offers and new model launches.
Strengthening relationships with customers: For example, direct marketing
techniques can be used strategically to improve customer retention, withpage 604
long-term programmes established to maximize customer lifetime value.
Mini Case 15.1 describes how a database could be used by a retailer to
develop customer loyalty.
Developing an information resource for use in direct marketing campaigns:
In this case, various techniques are employed:
Direct mail–a database can be used to select customers for mailings.
Telemarketing–a database can store telephone numbers so customers and
prospects can be contacted. Also, when customers contact a firm by
telephone, relevant information can be stored, including when the next
contact should be made.
Distributor management systems–a database can be the foundation on
which information is provided to distributors and their can be
performance monitored.
Loyalty marketing–highly loyal customers can be selected from the
database for special treatment as a reward for their loyalty.
Target marketing–other groups of individuals or businesses can be
targeted as a result of analysing the database. For example, buyer
behaviour information stored by supermarkets can be used to target
special promotions to those individuals likely to be receptive to them. A
consumer promotion for organic baby foods, for instance, could be sent
exclusively to mothers with young babies.
Campaign planning–the database can be used as a foundation
for sending consistent and coordinated campaigns and messages
to individuals and market segments.
Marketing evaluation–by recording responses to marketing mix inputs
(e.g. price promotions, advertising messages, product offers), it is
possible to assess how effective different approaches are with various
individuals and market segments.
MINI CASE 15.1
Using a Marketing Database to Keep Customers and
Remind Them of the Benefits of the Brand
Marketing databases offer great potential for planning and developing integrated marketing
communications campaigns. Suppose a retailer wanted to increase sales and profits usinga database. How might this happen? First, the retailer analyses its database to find distinct
groups of customers for whom it has the potential to offer superior value. The identification
of these target market segments allows tailored products, services and communications to
be aimed at them.

The purchasing patterns of individuals are established by means of a loyalty card
programme, which enables firms to use the data generated to work out patterns of shopper
behaviour at a detailed level.
Retailers argue the aim of a loyalty scheme is to improve customer retention by rewarding
various shopping behaviours, but the data they gather also allow customers’ shopping
behaviour to be tracked by frequency of visit, expenditure per visit and expenditure per
product category. Loyalty schemes create an opportunity for firms to capture data that can
be used for future marketing initiatives. Through its Clubcard, Tesco is currently helping 20
million users in the UK to save money as households face a difficult economic period, with
rising inflation and increased costs of living. And, by offering big discounts through its card
(or app), it is beating its competitors. There are significant incentives to hold a Clubcard: up
to 50 per cent savings on some products.
Retailers can gain an understanding of the types of products purchased together. For
example, UK retailer Boots uses its Advantage Card loyalty scheme (which has 15 million
active members) to conduct these kinds of analyses. For instance, analysis of Advantage
Card data revealed a link between the purchase of digital photo frames and new-baby
products. Because its products are organized along category lines, it never occurred to the
retailer to create a special offer linked to picture frames for the baby products buyer, yet this
is the kind of product new parents are likely to want.
If a retailer’s customers are classified into market segments based on their potential, their
degree of loyalty, and whether they are predominantly price- or promotion-sensitive,
analysis of loyalty data means it is possible to tailor the marketing strategy at a very
personal level. For example, to trade up high-potential, promotion-sensitive, low-loyalty
shoppers who do their main shopping elsewhere, high-value manufacturers’ coupons for
main shopping products might be mailed every two months until the consumer is traded up
to a different group. Also, high-loyalty customers can be targeted for special treatment such
as receiving a customer magazine.
Tesco gathers a rich stream of information from its 20 million Clubcard members across the
UK, which is then used to, for example: define segments (e.g. discount-driven ‘pricesensitives’, ‘foodies’, ‘heavy category users’ and ‘brand loyalists’), test consumer response
to promotions, test the effects of different prices and the use of different media, and
communicate more effectively with consumers. Product assortments in stores can also be
fine-tuned according to the buying habits of customers.
Both the Boots Advantage Card and Tesco Clubcard schemes have worked hard to tailor
the rewards offered to consumers. For example, Boots launched a Health Club and a
Parenting Club to offer its card holders rewards relevant to their lifestyles and interests.
Tesco Clubcard enabled its users to collect green Clubcard points when they used their own
shopping bags. Tesco is also using its Clubcard data to influence the decisions its
customers make, encouraging healthier choices. Insights from loyalty card data enable
profiling of customers using a health score for every basket of food sold to a Clubcard
member. Customers are then sent targeted mailings and offers. These data are also used to
inform the content of the supermarket’s free monthly magazine with healthy recipes and tips
on making better choices.
The success of the Boots Advantage Card and the Tesco Clubcard prompted other retailers
to launch loyalty cards. For example Waitrose, the high-quality UK supermarket, invested in
developing its MyWaitrose loyalty card as part of its strategy to reward customers, and
Morrisons offers its My Morrisons card. Rewarding customers has been found to be a highly
successful strategy in terms of improving return on investment. BPme Rewards gives
instant rewards to motorists when purchasing fuel; the scheme is similar to Shell Go+ and
Texaco Star Rewards. Each scheme rewards loyalty for returning to branded fuel stations
(Jones 2022). Nectar is another of Britain’s biggest loyalty cards, with more than 19 million
subscribers. It started as a joint initiative launched by its founders (Sainsbury’s, BP,
Barclaycard and Debenhams) and is constantly expanding its firms’ membership in order to
extend the rewards it can offer to signed-up shoppers. For example, Nectar points can be
collected from Sainsbury’s, eBay, Amazon, Sky and other Nectar member firms, and then
used to buy goods.
In the early days, when the technology needed to set up loyalty schemes was expensive,
only the largest retailers offered loyalty cards, but implementation costs have fallen
dramatically, which has meant more firms in different industries are developing such
schemes. For example, Tata Group, which is India’s biggest family conglomerate, has set
up a loyalty scheme modelled on Nectar.
Questions:
1. Suggest the benefits of loyalty cards as a source of data for developing direct
marketing campaigns.
2. Explain the type of data you might need to gather if you wanted to improve customer
retention.
3. Carry out desk research to identify three retailers’ loyalty cards. Compare the
benefits offered by each, and then suggest how you would improve the loyalty
schemes for both retailers and shoppers.

Managing a Direct Marketing Campaign
As we have seen, direct marketing can be very effective when integrated with
other elements of the promotional mix and used to support a coherent
marketing strategy. It is important to take an integrated approach to achieve
consistent messaging across communication tools. For example, information
disseminated through advertising should be consistent with a direct mail
campaign and information distributed via digital media. Increased use of
digital channels gives direct marketers the opportunity to use a combination of
media in timely sequences to achieve their objectives. For example, a B2B
firm marketing a new solar panel might place a direct response advertisement
in trade magazines to stimulate trial and orders. A response coupon, freephone
telephone number and email address would be provided, and prospects invited
to choose their most convenient method of contact. An inbound telemarketing
team would be trained to receive calls, and take either orders or requests for
appointments to book a demonstration. Another team would deal with mail and
email correspondence. An outbound telemarketing team would follow up
prospects judged to be of small and medium potential, while the sales force
would target larger potential customers and prospects.
Accordingly, direct marketers need to understand how a product is
positioned and its target market, so that messages sent out as part of a direct
marketing campaign do not conflict with those communicated by other
channels such as advertising or the sales force. The integrating mechanism is a
clear definition of marketing strategy.
Figure 15.3 shows the steps in the management of a direct marketing
campaign.
FIGURE 15.3
Managing a direct marketing campaignpage 606
As with all communication tools, it is vital a direct marketing campaign
makes a contribution to the marketing and marketing communication strategy
(see Chapters 12, 13 and 17) and the various objectives.
Identifying and understanding the target audience
The target audiences are the groups of people at whom the direct marketing
campaign is aimed (targeting strategies are described in Chapter 7). Lifestyle is
often targeted with direct marketing campaigns, but a particularly useful
method of segmentation for direct marketing purposes involves considering
the following groups:
Competitors’ customers–all people who buy the types of product the firm
produces but from its competitors
Prospects–people who have not bought from the firm before but who
qualify as potential purchasers (e.g. if the customers are large firms, otherpage 607
large firms should be targeted)
Enquirers–people who have contacted the organization and shown interest
in one or more products but, as yet, have not bought
Lapsed customers–people who have purchased in the past but appear to
have ceased buying
Referrals–people who have been recommended to the organization as
potential customers
Existing customers–people who are continuing to buy.
Once a target group is identified, the marketing team should decide how to
access the group. This may be done through existing customer data from the
CRM system and marketing database, which will provide a list of existing
contacts, or it may come from an external list broker. Experian, for instance, is
a global provider of individual and firm information for direct marketing
initiatives. This data and marketing intelligence firm has the world’s largest
consumer database; it can provide information on target segments and a suite
of services to help manage data, and ensure they are current and of the right
type to deliver successful direct marketing campaigns (Experian 2022). It is
also important to understand current trends and changes in buying behaviour.
Experian has a customer data engine that enables firms to build a picture of
customers both on- and offline.
Campaign objectives
Campaign objectives vary and may focus on: financial goals (sales, profits
and return on investment), marketing goals (acquire or retain customers, or
generate enquiries) and communication goals (create awareness or
change beliefs). However, one of the benefits of direct marketing is
its capacity to deliver against short-term objectives, which are easily measured
and evaluated.
Acquisition
Acquisition objectives can be costly, as it is more expensive to attract new
customers than to develop and keep existing ones. So a consideration when
setting this type of campaign objective is the concept of lifetime value. This
measures the profits that can be expected from customers over their expected
life with a firm. Banks know, for example, that gaining student accounts has
very high lifetime value, since switching between banks is unusual. Thismeans the allowable marketing cost per acquisition (or how much a firm can
afford to spend to acquire a new customer) can be quite high. If the calculation
were based on potential profits while a student, the figure would be much
lower. The establishment of a marketing database can, over time, provide
valuable information on buying patterns, which aids the calculation of lifetime
value.
Retention
Retention objectives focus on keeping customers and can have a direct impact
on profitability. Customer loyalty programmes have blossomed as a result,
with direct marketing playing a key role. Retention programmes are aimed at
maximizing a customer’s lifetime value to the firm. Maintaining a long-term
relationship with a customer provides the opportunity to upsell, cross-sell and
renew business. Upselling involves the promotion of higher-value products, for
example a more expensive car. Cross-selling entails the switching of customers
to other product categories, as when a music club promotes a book collection.
Renewal involves timing communications to existing customers for when they
are about to repurchase. For example, car dealers often send direct mail
promotional material two years after the purchase of a car, since many people
change cars after that period.
Creative decisions
Most direct marketing campaigns have different objectives from those of
advertising. Whereas advertising usually attempts to create awareness and
position the image of a brand in prospects’ minds, the aim of most direct
marketing is to make a sale. It is more orientated to immediate action than is
advertising. Recipients of direct marketing messages need to see a clear benefit
to responding. Increasingly, direct marketing techniques are delivered via
digital channels, for example Costa Coffee’s Costa Club offers its members (in
return for signing up via its website or app and providing personal data) one
free drink in every eight, a free cake on your birthday and more rewards if you
have a reusable cup. Through the Costa Club app, regular money-off offers
sent are direct to the member. The app helps members keep track of their
rewards and acts as a prompt to make more purchases when close to a reward
goal (Costa Coffee 2022).page 608
Marmite, the savoury spread, developed an IMC campaign based on a
scientific study, and called it the ‘Gene Project’. A humorous television advert
suggested people are genetically predisposed to love or hate Marmite, and
invited them to get a test kit to find out online by sharing images and videos.
Subsequently, a gene test kit was sent through direct mail. Sales of the brand
increased by 14 per cent (D&AD 2018).
Creative decisions will be captured using a creative brief, which is a
document that usually contains details of specific communications objectives,
product benefits, target market analysis, details of the offer being made, the
message that is to be communicated and the action plan (i.e. how the campaign
will be run).
Executing and evaluating the campaign
Execution of the campaign may be in-house or through the use of a specialist
agency. Direct marketing activity usually has clearly defined short-term
objectives against which performance can be measured. Some of the most
frequently used measurements are:
response rate (the proportion of contacts responding)
total sales (volume and value)
number of contacts purchasing
sales rate (percentage of contacts purchasing)
number of enquiries
enquiry rate
cost per contact
cost per enquiry
cost per sale
conversion rate from enquiry to sale
average order value
renewal rate
repeat purchase rate.
Direct marketers should bear in mind the longer-term effects of their
activities. A campaign may seemingly be unprofitable in the short term, but
when renewals and repeat purchases are considered, the long-term value of the
campaign may be highly positive.Social Media Marketing
Social media marketing deserves further consideration as a direct marketing
channel. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and many other platforms
provide a direct connection between customers and businesses. Social media
are widely used in integrated multimedia campaigns across digital media
channels. It is important to remember that, on social media, data for marketing
campaigns tend to be in a blended form and so targeting is at an aggregated
level, focusing on groups and their behaviours rather than individuals (see
Exhibit 15.2). In addition, access to personal data is increasingly controlled by
privacy laws (Hanlon 2021). For example GDPR, discussed in Chapter 2, has
introduced new legislation to control the use of data. For digital marketers this
means rethinking how they use cookies (online text files that recognize users).
In the past, cookies have been used as digital mechanisms that remember login
details and store individual preferences, however the EU sees cookies as a
means of tracking online behaviour that potentially represents an intrusion of
privacy. As a result, further new legislation has been implemented to ensure
website visitors explicitly agree to the use of cookies when browsing websites.

The social media marketing landscape
In 2022, there were more than 4.7 billion active social media users, and in
excess of 5.3 billion mobile phone users. Globally, mobile penetration
represented 66.9 per cent in terms of unique users against total population. Onpage 609
average users spend over 2 hours a day using social media, and social media
users are most likely to be aged between 16 and 55, as almost three-quarters of
all adults in these age bands say they use one or more social networking sites.
They are most likely to have some form of post-16 education and are slightly
more likely to be female than male (We Are Social 2022a). Age has been a key
differentiator of users of social networks since these networks’ inception.
Although the number of users over the age of 65 is increasing, under-30s are
more likely than any other age group to use a social networking site.
Social media platforms attract users mainly as a way of keeping in touch
with friends and family, as a source of entertainment, to stay abreast of the
news and find information, with Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram,
WeChat and TikTok being the most used platforms. This means direct
marketers have many opportunities to capture the attention of their target
customers (We Are Social 2022b). Consequently, social media are increasingly
being added to campaigns as these platforms are used when people–especially
younger audiences–search for brand information.
Social media campaigns
Marketers have increased their ad spend on social media, which has become an
ever-present element in the multimedia communications mix. With their scope
and reach, social media offer much potential for developing highly creative
and interactive direct marketing using them to connect directly with groups of
like-minded consumers. For example, a partnership between World Animal
Protection and Dutch advertising agency FVV BBDO used a 3D
printer and social media to raise awareness of the harm done by
tourists riding elephants when they go on holiday. Each time someone in the
Netherlands (or a visitor to Schiphol airport) made a pledge online, another
section of the elephant was printed (Oakes 2015). MudJeans is part of the
circular economy and produces jeans by recycling old jeans, leaving no waste
and using over 90 per cent less water than in the production of an average pair
of jeans. Customers can lease or buy a pair of MudJeans, and the retail outlet is
a point at which to return the jeans when they are finished with them. The firm
has built a community of like-minded customers who want guilt-free,
fashionable clothing, by engaging them when they buy, lease or return their
jeans, and encouraging the sharing of personal stories at #MudJeans
(MudJeans 2019). Discount supermarket retailer Aldi faced a lawsuit from
Marks & Spencer over the design of its children’s caterpillar birthday cakes.M&S claimed Aldi was selling a cake, called Cuthbert, which looked like its
own Colin the Caterpillar. Aldi is known for making its own versions of other
popular brand’s products and the case attracted much media attention. Aldi
launched a campaign, #FreeCuthbert, and using humour gained hundreds of
thousands of likes on Twitter. The campaign went viral, turned into an award￾winning reactive social media campaign and ended with proceeds from sales
of the cake being donated to charity the Teenage Cancer Trust (Lim 2021;
SKAI 2021).

MARKETING IN ACTION 15.1
Streaming Social Media
Social media have changed how we communicate, disseminate information, and share
personal thoughts and ideas. Since Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Reddit and LinkedIn
emerged in the 2000s many new platforms and social apps have been developed around
the globe, vying for the attention of audiences and contributors. Navigating social media is
challenging for marketers as they must determine if a new channel or format is just a
passing fad or is about to turn into the fastest-growing global communication platform, as
was the case with TikTok and its short-form video content.

Social media streaming is the latest trend grabbing attention, and the major platforms are
cashing in. YouTube, Facebook and LinkedIn allow users to go live with a webcam, mobile
phone, multiple screens and microphones, but there are various revenue-sharing policies in
place for streamers who wish to monetize their live feeds. Twitter enables users to engage
in live chat, again with limits on how streamers can monetize their content.page 610
Relative newcomers have also entered the streaming market:
In a few short years TikTok has acquired more than a billion users. It is a video-sharing
platform with a difference as it offers opportunities for brands to reach new markets and
drive sales. #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt has had 14 billion views.
Live-streaming platform Twitch is mainly for video gamers. Audiences (aged 16–34)
interact through watching and recording game play, but they can also live-stream
cooking videos, music and more. Twitch is attracting the attention of marketers, many of
whom plan to us this platform to reach businesses and consumers by posting ads,
sponsoring ‘streamers’ and creating emoticons.
Caffeine is a platform designed to allow users to create live broadcasts, share TV
screens and take part in live game play.
Some questions for marketers considering the use of live-streaming in their direct marketing
campaigns include:
How many active users are on the platform and how fast is it growing?
What type of content is shared on the platform and does this align with our brand
messaging?
What types of community groups are on the platform and what are their interests?
Who is the audience for the platform and will the brand’s existing social media
audiences be attracted to it?
What is the wider media’s coverage of the new platform–is it getting local or global
attention?

Personal Selling and Sales
Management
This is an important element of the direct communications mix, and one that
contributes significantly to marketing strategies for many firms. Millions of
people are engaged in selling and each will generate revenue to support the
functioning of other parts of an organization. Building, transacting and
managing relationships for mutual benefit is at the heart of personal selling and
traditionally involves face-to-face contact with a customer. Increasingly,
however, the adoption of e-commerce and other technologies is expanding
selling opportunities and increasing digitization of elements of sales
management processes. Additionally, the Covid-19 pandemic impacted on this
form of communication as lockdown restrictions changed working practices
with immediate effect, and instability in business operations, production andsupply all contributed to a period of uncertainty for buyers and sellers, which
meant changing personal selling practices, often moving out of the office and
working from home via video (Alavi et al. 2022). Nevertheless, even though
the nature of personal selling is evolving, it is an important communication
technique widely used in the B2B market, especially when a high-value
contract is at stake, as personal selling permits direct interaction between buyer
and seller. This two-way communication means a seller can identify the
specific needs and problems of the buyer and tailor a sales presentation in light
of this knowledge. The concerns of the buyer can also be dealt with on a
personal basis. However, this flexibility comes with costs–the cost of the time
involved in the selling process, travel and sales office overheads–although the
flexible working practices adopted during and post-pandemic are allowing
firms to streamline and mitigate some of these. Typically, 10 per cent of a
firm’s revenue will be allocated to the marketing communications budget and a
large proportion of this can be spent on the sales force, although this will vary
depending on the markets in which a firm operates (e.g. B2B or B2C) and the
lifecycle stage of the product–at launch, spend will be higher on personal
selling and marketing events than it will towards the end of the product life
cycle. Cost is often higher because of the technical nature of the products
being sold, and the need to maintain close personal relationships between the
selling and buying organizations. By removing barriers, sales teams can
reassure customers about products and services and ‘retrain’ customers.
However, the nature of the personal selling and the management of the
sales function is changing: organizations are reducing the size of their sales
forces; changing working practices due to environmental issues (e.g. the
pandemic and climate change encouraging the adoption of flexible and remote
working); greater buyer concentration and centralized buying, as the sales
management ecosystem brings together buyers, sellers and partners; and
increased digitization as recognition of the high costs of maintaining a field
sales team against lower-cost technological solutions is leading to the
replacement of human sales teams. Furthermore, innovative digital solutions
exist which are helping make sales teams more effective, and their responses to
customers more responsive and efficient. For example:
Cloud computing is creating opportunities to link up throughout the sales
process. This improves the richness of available information and improves
flexibility in how sales teams can respond to customers. Salesforce.com, for
instance, developed an innovative digital platform in the cloud to enable its
users to manage collaborations, within and across sales channels, customerpage 611
relationships, employee workload and performance, as well as a range of
other functions (Salesforce.com 2022) (see Figure 15.4).
Data analytics provide precise insights into customer behaviour, buying
patterns and buying cycles. When linked to CRM systems and various forms
of data capture devices, analysts can support decision-making for sales
teams.
Artificial intelligence-empowered applications are being developed to
handle sales leads, contacts and follow-up, as well as to respond to
customer queries, and are predicted to become an important part of
sales and marketing automation, with virtual assistants, chatbots and AI￾enabled technologies driving marketing practices (Dwivedi and Wang
2022). For example, Siemens AG uses robots, self-optimized manufacturing
lines and AI to drive production efficiencies and innovation, inform
decision-making and analyse vendor proposals (Ransbotham et al. 2019;
Siemens AG 2022).
FIGURE 15.4

This trend towards automation of the sales process is leading to a greater
concentration of buying power into fewer hands, and heightens the importance
of customer relationship management and key account selling; this involvesthe use of dedicated sales teams that service the accounts of major buyers. The
changing marketing environment is affecting selling and sales management,
and many firms are looking for ways to optimize the performance of their sales
teams.
The remainder of this section explores the characteristics of selling
required to cope with today’s changing and challenging marketing
environment, and the stages in the sales management process (see Figure
15.5).
FIGURE 15.5
Personal selling and sales management
Functions of personal selling
In today’s competitive environment, a sales force needs a wide range of skills
to compete successfully. Gone are the days when salespeople required simple
presentational and closing skills to be successful. Personal selling enables
individuals to interact and form bonds, which can develop into long-term
relationships that are beneficial for all parties concerned. The characteristics of
selling require a wide array of skills, and without such an understanding
salespeople will be ill equipped to tackle the following functions successfully.
Increasing sales performancepage 612
Sales teams are paid to deliver results, and recently the emphasis has shifted
towards profitability and away from sales volume. There is a constant
requirement to improve sales productivity, which includes consideration of the
cost of sales teams, ongoing servicing costs and production costs. Technology
is streamlining operational costs and helping sales managers achieve more
cost-effective decision-making.
Customer retention and deletion
Many firms find 80 per cent of their sales come from 20 per cent of their
customers. This means it is vital to devote considerable resources to retaining
existing high-volume, high-potential and highly profitable customers. Key
account management (KAM; see later in this chapter) has become an
important form of sales organization, as a salesperson or sales team can focus
their efforts on fewer major customers.
At the other end of the spectrum, firms are finding some small customers
cost the organization money. This is because servicing and distribution of
products to these customers may push costs beyond the revenue generated.
However, technology-driven solutions, for example customer relationship
management, telemarketing and e-commerce systems, are providing ways to
service accounts and control costs using digital solutions.
Customer relationship management
Growing emphasis on customer retention as part of strategic customer
management has led to an increasing use of customer relationship
management (CRM) systems (see Chapter 5). CRM places the customer at the
centre of the firm’s focus, with the sales organization charged with taking a
strategic view of designing and implementing superior customer relationships
(Lane and Piercy 2004). This requires sales management to work towards the
total integration of how customer relationships are designed, established,
managed and sustained. For example, Cisco Systems has developed sales
strategies and selling tools to support the personal selling process.
Knowledge managementKnowing your customers and how they want to interact with a firm is
becoming increasingly important. Equally important is understanding how the
sales force interacts with and responds to customers. Technological advances
such as email, mobile phones, web and videoconferencing, and sales support
systems have transformed the way in which knowledge is transferred. Cloud,
web and mobile computing devices mean salespeople can store customer and
competitor information, make presentations and communicate with head office
digitally, remotely and from almost any location. Furthermore, all the
information needed to make a sale, such as price lists, product availability and
delivery times, can be held digitally so it is readily available anywhere.
Salesforce.com is leading the way in sales force automation. Its digital
platforms are designed to speed up the closing of sales deals, automatically
generate leads and help to make decisions. In addition, they enable account
and contact management.
Problem-solving and system selling
Personal selling, particularly in B2B situations, is based upon the salesperson
acting as an expert/consultant who works with the customer to identify
problems, determine needs, and propose and implement effective solutions
(Rackham and DeVincentis 1999). Furthermore, customers are increasingly
looking for a systems solution rather than buying an individual product. This
means, for example, to sell door handles to a firm like Ford Motor Company, a
supplier must be able to sell a door system that includes door handles, locking
and opening devices, as well as having a thorough knowledge of door
technology and the ability to suggest to Ford solutions to problems that may
arise.
Satisfying needs and creating customer value
A salesperson must have the ability to identify and satisfy customer needs.
Firms are moving away from merely selling products towards adding value to
their customers’ businesses. Customers do not always recognize they have a
need for a particular product or service, and it is the salesperson’s job in such
situations to stimulate need recognition but also to support, educate and inform
(Ingram et al. 2019). For example, a customer may not realize a machine in the
production process has low productivity compared with newer, more
technologically advanced machines. The salesperson’s job will be to make the
customer aware of the problem and the benefits of modernizing the productionpage 613
process, and to find additional ways of guiding customers towards adding
value, possibly through ongoing services packages, upgrades and guarantees.
In so doing, the salesperson will have added value to the customer’s business
by reducing costs, and created a win/win situation for both the firm and its
customers.
Defining the strategic role of sales management
Success in selling comes from implementing the marketing concept when face
to face with customers; increasingly this involves building long-term
relationships with more emphasis on customer needs and wants and less on
short-term sales transactions. Creating a customer-driven culture throughout
the firm bringing together sales and marketing is seen as best practice and
should help to define the strategic role of sales management (Ingram et al.
2019). Salespeople have an opportunity to implement unique presentations
tailored to individual customers and to rapidly adjust messages in response to
customer reactions. Indeed, research has shown customer-orientated selling is
associated with higher levels of sales force performance (Román et al. 2002).
But there are also many challenges to overcome if a sales team is to be
successful.
Understanding buyer behaviour
Thought should also be given to understanding customer behaviour (see
Chapter 4). Questions should be asked, such as who the likely key people are
to talk to, what are their probable choice criteria, are there any gatekeepers
preventing access to some people, who need to be circumvented, and
what are the likely opportunities and threats that may arise in the
selling situation. All of the answers to these questions need to be verified when
in the actual selling situation, but prior consideration can help salespeople to
be clear in their own minds about the important issues. Online there can be a
wealth of information about the buying organization; the buyer’s website,
product catalogues, reviews, analysis and blogs are all useful sources of
information. CRM systems allow salespeople to access customer information
held by their firms via the internet. But herein lies a potential problem: as
customers expect more, sales teams need to be more informed and more able
to search vast stores of information to find out about their customers’ needs.Identifying customer needs
People buy products because they have problems that give rise to needs. For
example, a machine’s unreliability (problem) causes the need to replace it with
a new one (purchase). Therefore, the first task is to identify the needs and
problems of each customer. Only by doing so can the salesperson connect with
the customer’s situation. Having done so, the salesperson can select the
product that best fits the customer’s need and sell the appropriate benefits. It is
benefits that link customer needs to product features, as in:
In the previous example, it would be essential to convince the customer the
salesperson’s machine possessed features that guaranteed machine reliability.
Knowledge of competitors’ products would allow salespeople to show how
their machine possessed features that gave added reliability. In this way,
salespeople are in an ideal situation to convince customers of a product’s
differential advantage. Whenever possible, factual evidence of product
superiority should be shown to customers. This is much more convincing than
mere claims by the salesperson.
Effective needs and problem identification requires the development of
questioning and listening skills. The problem is, people are more used to
making statements than asking questions. The art of asking sensible questions
that produce a clear understanding of the customer’s situation requires training
and considerable experience. The hallmark of inexperienced salespeople is that
they do all the talking; successful salespeople know how to get the customer to
do most of the talking. In this way, they gain the information necessary to
make a sale. Digital technology solutions are increasingly used as part of the
process of identifying customer needs.
Dealing with cultural nuances
Salespeople operating in overseas markets need to be aware of the cultural
nuances shaping business relationships. For example, in the West, a deadline is
acceptable, whereas in many Middle Eastern cultures it would be taken as an
insult. In China, salespeople need to acknowledge the importance of
personalized and close business relationships, known as guanxi. Guanxi is a
set of personal relationships/connections on which a person can draw to secure
resources or advantage when doing business. Guanxi can lead to preferentialpage 614
treatment in the form of easy access to limited resources, increased
accessibility to information and preferential credit terms. For foreigners, this
means having as part of their guanxi network an influential person in an
organization or government position. Another key issue in Chinese culture is
the avoidance of ‘loss of face’. Visiting salespeople should avoid creating a
situation where a Chinese person might ‘lose face’ by finding themselves in an
embarrassing situation (e.g. by displaying lack of knowledge or
understanding). Trust is also central to forming business relations in China
(Bedford 2022). It is important salespeople do not make the mistake of using
self-reference criteria when selling abroad; assuming the values and
behavioural norms that apply in their own country are equally applicable
elsewhere. To avoid this failing, they need training in the special skills
required to sell to people of different cultures.
The sales management landscape
Sales managers, like their production, marketing and finance counterparts,
need to recruit, train, motivate and evaluate their staff. But the sales landscape
is becoming increasingly complex, with widespread application of technology,
the increased volume of available information, and changing roles of
salespeople as AI and other technologies are deployed in selling processes
(Peesker et al. 2022).
The selling context is also changing and there are now more stakeholders,
with more diverse interests, to be managed. These changes mean different
skills are required and recruitment of professional sales staff can be costly.
Specific challenges include:
Customer knowledge–availability of information online can mean customers
are very well informed, not only about potential suppliers’ products but also
about competing products. The result is customers can know their
buying options before they encounter a sales professional. This
means sales staff must be well trained and educated prior to meeting
customers (Hochstein et al. 2021).
Product complexity–demand for customized options has increased and
customers are increasingly seeking combinations of goods and services to
fulfil their needs. Salespeople need to connect with other suppliers as part of
an interconnected ecosystem, to be able to provide the breadth and depth of
products and services required (Peesker et al. 2021).Firms need to find ways to ensure such challenges are met, as the
contribution of personal selling and sales management can make to the
successful achievement of marketing objectives is significant.
Managing the sales force
Besides deciding personal selling objectives and strategies, and designing the
sales force, the firm has to manage the sales force. This requires setting
specific salesperson objectives, recruitment and selection, training, motivation
and compensation, and evaluation of salespeople (see below). These activities
have been shown to improve salesperson performance, indicating the key role
sales managers play as facilitators in helping salespeople to perform better
(Piercy et al. 1998; Ingram et al. 2019).
Setting objectives To achieve aggregate sales objectives, individual
salespeople need to have their own sales targets to achieve. Usually, targets are
set in sales terms (sales quotas) but, increasingly, profit targets are being used,
reflecting the need to guard against sales being bought cheaply by excessive
discounting. To gain commitment to targets, consultation with individual
salespeople is recommended, but, in the final analysis, it is the sales manager’s
responsibility to set targets. Payment may be linked to achievement of the
targets. Sales management may also wish to set input objectives, such as the
proportion of time spent developing new accounts and the time spent
introducing new products. They may also specify the number of calls expected
per day and the precise customers that should be called.
Recruitment and selection The importance of recruiting high-calibre
salespeople cannot be overestimated. Clearly, the quality of the salespeople
sales managers recruit has a substantial effect on performance.
The recruitment and selection process follows five stages:
1. preparation of the job description and personnel specification
2. identification of sources of recruitment and methods of communication
3. design of the application form and preparation of a shortlist
4. the interview
5. use of supplementary selection aids.page 615
Training Sometimes, more traditional sales managers believe their
salespeople can best train themselves by doing the job. This old-fashioned
approach ignores the value of a training programme that provides a frame of
reference in which learning can take place, and potential benefits such as
enhanced skill levels, improved motivation and greater confidence in the
ability to perform well at selling, a factor shown to be related to improved
sales performance (Krishnan et al. 2002; Ingram et al. 2019).
B2B customers expect a seamless experience, whether buying face to face
or online (Arli et al. 2018), so a training programme should include knowledge
about the firm (its objectives, strategies and organization), its products
(features and benefits), its competitors and their products, selling procedures
and techniques, work organization (including report preparation), and
relationship management. Salespeople need to be trained in the management of
long-term customer relationships, as well as in context-specific selling skills
and should also be aware of the significance of the shift in power towards the
customer.
Motivation and compensation Effective motivation is based on a deep
understanding of salespeople as individuals, their personalities and value
systems. In one sense, sales managers do not motivate salespeople–they
provide the enabling conditions in which salespeople motivate themselves. But
sales managers should understand their own role and recognize different
individuals respond differently to certain types of motivation, so they need to
find ways to relate to and share values with salespeople in order to build
stronger and motivated teams (Mallin et al. 2022). Motivation can be
understood through the relationship between needs, drives and goals. Luthans
stated that, ‘the basic process involves needs (deprivations) which set drives in
motion (deprivations with direction) to accomplish goals (anything which
alleviates a need and reduces a drive)’ (Luthans 1997). For example, the need
for more money may result in a drive to work harder to receive
increased pay. Improving motivation is important to sales success;
research (Pullins 2001; Holmes and Srivastava 2002) has shown high levels of
motivation lead to:
increased creativity
working smarter and a more adaptive selling approach
working harder
increased use of win/win negotiation tactics
higher self-esteema more relaxed attitude and a less negative emotional tone
enhancement of relationships.
It is important to note that motivation needs to encourage the types of
behaviour that contribute to a firm’s marketing strategy and success. Therefore
any reward scheme should benefit those who exhibit the correct behaviour.
Stimulating appropriate behaviour in the current sales environment means
understanding how to foster trust, commitment and shared values, as these
form the basis of strong customer relationships (Morgan and Hunt 1994).
Sales force size and organization
Sales force size Practical methods for deciding the number of salespeople
needed include assessing the market and the opportunities for selling (Egloff
2020), and considering seller capacity–an approach originally called the
workload approach. It is based on the calculation of the total annual calls
required per year divided by the average calls per year that can be expected
from one salesperson (Talley 1961). The procedure involves: grouping
customers into categories according to the value of goods bought, their
potential for the future, and the need for prospecting; assessing call frequency
(the number of calls per year to an account); calculating workload per year by
multiplying call frequency by the number of customers in each category, and
considering the number of calls per salesperson; finally, determining the
number of salespeople needed by dividing the total number of annual calls
required by the average number of calls one salesperson can make per year.
Sales force organization There are three basic forms of sales force
organization: geographic, product and customer-based structures. The
strengths and weakness of each are as follows:
Geographic: The sales area is broken down into territories based on
workload and potential, and a salesperson is assigned to each one to sell all
of the product range. This provides a simple, unambiguous definition of
each salesperson’s sales territory, and proximity to customers encourages the
development of personal relationships. It is also a more cost-efficient
method of organization than product- or customer-based systems. However,
when products are technically different and sell in several diverse markets, it
may be unreasonable to expect a salesperson to be knowledgeable about all
products and their applications. Under such circumstances, a firm is likely to
move to a product- or customer-based structure. Computacentre, forpage 616
example, supplies solutions and technological sourcing in different
geographical regions (the UK, France, Germany and the US).
Product: Product specialization is effective where a firm has a diverse
product range selling to different customers (or at least different people
within a given organization). However, if the products sell, essentially, to the
same customers, problems of route duplication (and consequently higher
travel costs) and multiple calls to the same customer can arise. When
applicable, product specialization allows each salesperson to be well
informed about a product line, its applications and customer benefits.
Hewlett-Packard, for instance, uses a product-based system because of its
wide product range. This sees salespeople assigned to one of its divisions:
workstations and personal systems, printing supplies, commercial, or
personal.
Customer-based: The problem of the same customer being served by
product divisions of the same supplier, the complexity of buyer behaviour
that requires input not only from the sales function but from other functional
groups (such as engineering, finance, logistics and marketing),
centralization of purchasing, and the immense value of some customers, are
factors that have led many suppliers to rethink how they organize their sales
forces. Firms are increasingly organizing around customers, and shifting
resources from product or regional divisions to customer-focused business
units. Sales forces can be organized along market segment, account size or
new versus existing account lines. Computer firms have traditionally
organized their sales forces on the basis of industry served (e.g. government,
banking, retailing, manufacturing), in recognition of varying needs,
problems and potential applications. Specialization by these market
segments allows salespeople to gain in-depth knowledge of customers and
be able to monitor trends in the industry that may affect demand
for their products. An increasing trend in many industries is
towards key account management (see below), which reflects the increasing
concentration of buying power into fewer but larger customers. These
customers are serviced by a key account sales force comprising senior
salespeople who develop close personal relationships with customers, can
handle sophisticated sales arguments and are skilled in the art of negotiation
(as discussed later in this chapter).
Table 15.2 illustrates some important distinctions between traditional
(transactional selling) and key account management.TABLE 15.2 Distinctions between transactional selling and key account management

Digitization of the sales force
Technology is changing sales practices and is used to supplement or even
replace a human sales force. Digitized sales can become a source of
competitive advantage–especially when used to provide deep insights into
customer needs and wants–and can be used to build closer connected
relationships, and data-driven sales management decision-making (Fischer et
al. 2022). Digitization is changing the nature of buyer–seller relationships,
with power shifting towards the buyer, and their behaviour is changing through
the use of advanced digital technology systems (Agnihotri et al. 2016).
Examples of technologies being deployed are online chat, robot assistants,
avatars, sales configurators, e-commerce, and automated routine purchasing
and administrative tasks (Mahlamäki et al. 2020).
Drivers of the digitization of sales management include those listed below.
Productivity gains: AI is automating sales and marketing activities across
the sale process; data analytics and a spectrum of new digital technologies
are supporting better, more informed decision-making, increasing sales and
more efficient product distribution.
Improved communications and lower costs are making firms rethink their
sales strategies. Adoption of digital media, especially social media
(Facebook, LinkedIn, blogs), can generate value through customer-to￾customer interactions and wider knowledge gathering as boundaries
between markets become blurred (Mingione and Leoni 2020).page 617
Greater compliance with management strategies, due to increased
transparency of salespeople’s performance.
Increased opportunity for international expansion as technology reduces
geographical, cultural and logistical barriers.
Challenges include:
Cost of investment in digital transformation, integration with existing legacy
systems, and training and education of the sales force.
Adapting to more powerful and new types of customers, who are better
informed and more agile when using digital technologies, so are less
dependent on salespeople (Bongers et al. 2021). Technology means there are
now fewer face-to-face interactions and some customers prefer remote
buying (Deva et al. 2021).
Learning new ways of selling. Salespeople need to be trained accordingly to
handle information, communications and interactions differently. The
salesperson role becomes more that of a facilitator who ensures a buyer can
make an informed purchasing decision, adds value using interactions to
guide customer choices, and encourages collaboration across the sales
ecosystem (Fischer et al. 2022).
Learning new ways of buying. For some customers, using AI-driven systems
is unnatural and can make them feel uncomfortable (Davenport et al. 2020).
The drivers of change and the shift towards more digitized approaches
means reshaping sales management and stimulating the growth of sales
management ecosystems (Mattila et al. 2021). Sales managers need to monitor
changes in technology and the impact on customer relationships. In turn,
successful adaptation to the digitized sales environment is becoming a key
determinant of a firm’s long-term success.
Developing business-to-business relationships
Customer relationships are becoming increasingly important in both business￾to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) markets. A key tool for
implementing relationship marketing is key account management (KAM), or
corporate account management as it is sometimes called (Herhausen et al.
2022). In many industries, the use of KAM is widespread and reflects theincreasing concentration of buying power into fewer but larger customers.
Developing relationships with key accounts is often crucial to the survival of a
business (Tzempelikos and Gounaris 2015). Key accounts are serviced by a
key account sales force comprising senior salespeople, who develop close
personal relationships with customers, can handle sophisticated sales
arguments and are skilled at negotiation.
Several advantages may be derived from adopting a KAM-structured
approach towards relationship development (see Figure 15.6).
FIGURE 15.6
Potential advantages of key account management (KAM)
A potential advantage of the KAM approach is it can lead to the
development of close connective relationships. For example, the salesperson
can get to know who the decision-makers are in a firm and who influences the
buying decision. This creates opportunities to gain greater penetration of the
decision-making unit and cultivate relationships within the key account.
Salespeople can pull the buying decision through the organization from the
users, deciders and influencers to the buyer, rather than the more difficult task
of pushing it through the buyer into the organization, as is done with more
traditional sales approaches. Closer relationships can foster bettercommunication, as the buyer becomes familiar with a dedicated salesperson or
sales team, and knows who to contact for information or if a problem occurs.
The selling firms can devote extra resources to the key account, which can
result in higher sales, and better follow-up and after-sales service. Effective
KAM can also benefit the selling team. As the KAM relationship develops, the
sales team may have the opportunity for career development: a tiered sales
force system with key (or national) account selling at the top provides
promotional opportunities for salespeople who wish to advance within the
sales force rather than enter a traditional sales-management position. Lower
costs can be achieved through joint agreement of optimum production and
delivery schedules, and by demand forecasting. Finally, there may be
cooperation on research and development for new products and joint
promotions (e.g. within the fast-moving consumer goods/retail sector).
The development and management of a key account is a process that takes
place over time between buyers and sellers. The KAM relational development
model (Figure 15.7) plots the typical progression of a buyer–seller relationship
based on the nature of the customer relationship (transactional–collaborative)
and the level of involvement with customers (simple–complex), and this
configuration will impact on overall performance (Wilson et al. 2000;
Homburg et al. 2002). The involvement of digital media, particularly social
media, has also been found to improve the effectiveness of KAM.
FIGURE 15.7
Key account relational development modelpage 618
Figure 15.7 shows the five stages of key account relational development:
pre KAM, early KAM, mid KAM, partnership KAM and synergistic KAM. A
sixth stage, not shown in the diagram (uncoupling KAM), represents the
breakdown of the relationship, which can happen at any point during the
process.
Let’s look at these stages in more detail:
1. Pre KAM describes preparation for KAM, or ‘prospecting’. The task is to
identify accounts with potential that can be developed, and opportunities for
developing closer relationships.
2. Early KAM involves the exploration of opportunities for closer collaboration
by identifying the motives, culture and concerns of the customer. The selling
firm needs to convince the buying firm of the benefits of being a preferred
supplier. The seller seeks to understand the buyer’s decision-making unit
and processes, and the problems and opportunities that relate to the value￾adding activities. An objective of the sales effort is to build trust based on
consistent performance and open communications. The account manager
seeks to create a more attractive offering than any competing supplier, and
attempts to establish credibility and deepen personal relationships.
3. By the mid KAM stage, trust has been established and the supplier is one of
a small number of preferred sources of the product. The number and range
of contacts increase. These may include social events, which help to deepen
relationships across the two organizations. The account-review process
carried out at the selling organization tends to move upwards to involve
senior management, because of the importance of the customer and the level
of resource allocation. Since the account is not yet exclusive, the activities
of competitors require constant monitoring.
4. At the partnership KAM stage, the buying organization regards the supplier
as an important strategic resource. The level of trust is sufficient for both
parties to be willing to share sensitive information. The focus of activities
moves to joint problem-solving, collaborative product development and
mutual training of the other firm’s staff. The buying firm is now channelling
nearly all of its business in the relevant product group(s) to the one supplier.
The arrangement is formalized in a partnership agreement, which has a time
frame that can ensure stability. Performance is monitored and contactspage 619
between departments of the two organizations are extensive. The buying
organization expects guaranteed continuity of supply, excellent service and
top-quality products. A key task of the account manager is to reinforce the
high levels of trust to form a barrier against potential competitors.
5. Synergistic KAM is the ultimate stage of the relational development model.
Buyer and seller see one another not as two separate organizations but as
part of a larger entity. Top management commitment manifests itself in joint
board meetings. Joint business planning, research and development, and
marketing research take place. Costing systems become transparent,
unnecessary costs are removed and process improvements are mutually
achieved. For example, a logistics firm together with one of its retail key
accounts may have six cross-boundary teams working on process
improvements at any one time (Wilson and Millman 2003).
6. Uncoupling KAM is when transactions and interaction cease. The causes of
uncoupling need to be understood so uncoupling can be avoided:
Breakdowns are more often attributable to changes in key personnel and
relationship problems than price conflicts. The danger of uncoupling is
particularly acute in early KAM, when a single point of contact prevails.
If, for example, the key account manager leaves to be replaced by
someone who, in the buyer’s eyes, is less skilled, or there is a personality
clash, the relationship may end.
A second cause of uncoupling is breach of trust. For example,
the breaking of a promise over a delivery deadline, product
improvement or equipment repair can weaken or kill a business
relationship. The key to handling such problems is to reduce the impact of
surprise. The supplier should let the buying organization know
immediately when a problem becomes apparent. It should also show
humility when discussing the problem with a customer.
Firms also uncouple through neglect. Long-term relationships can foster
complacency, and customers can perceive themselves as being taken for
granted. Cultural mismatches can occur, for example when the customer
stresses price, whereas the supplier focuses on lifecycle costs. Difficulties
can also occur between bureaucratic and entrepreneurial styles of
management. Product or service quality problems can provoke
uncoupling. Any kind of performance problem, or the perception that
rivals now offer superior performance, can trigger a breakdown in
relations. ‘In’ suppliers must build entry barriers by ensuring productquality is constantly improved, and any problems are dealt with speedily
and professionally.
Not all uncoupling is instigated by the buying firm. A key account may be
de-rated or terminated because of loss of market share or the onset of
financial problems that impair the attractiveness of the account.
The importance of KAM on a worldwide scale is reflected in the
employment of global account managers by many multinational organizations.
Global account management (GAM) is the process of coordinating and
developing mutually beneficial long-term relationships with a select group of
strategically important customers (accounts) operating in globalized industries
(Montgomery et al. 1999). Global account managers perform two key roles:
1. managing the internal interface between global and national account
management, which is often embedded in a headquarters/subsidiary
relationship
2. managing the external interface between the supplier and the dispersed
activities of its global accounts (Wilson and Millman 2003).
Multinational customers are increasingly buying on a centralized or
coordinated basis, and seek suppliers who can provide consistent and seamless
service across countries. Consequently, suppliers are developing and
implementing GAM, and are creating global account managers to manage the
interface between seller and buyer on a global basis.
Evaluating the effectiveness of personal selling
and sales management
Evaluation of the total personal selling function is necessary to assess its
overall contribution to marketing strategy. The results of this assessment may
lead to a more cost-efficient means of servicing accounts being introduced
(e.g. direct mail or telemarketing), the realization that the selling function is
under-resourced, or the conclusion that the traditional form of sales
organization is in need of reform. One firm that suspected its sales force had
become complacent moved every salesperson to a different territory. Despite
having to forge new customer relationships, sales increased by a quarter in the
following year.
Evaluation of the personal selling function should also include assessment
of the quality of the function’s relationship with marketing and otherpage 620
organizational units. Salespeople who manage the external relationship with
distributors (e.g. retailers) must collaborate internally with their colleagues in
marketing to agree joint business objectives and develop marketing
programmes (e.g. new products and promotions) that meet the needs of
distributors as well as consumers, so these will be readily adopted by them.
This means close collaboration and good working relationships are essential
(Dewsnap and Jobber 2002).
Sales force evaluation provides the information necessary to check
whether targets are being achieved, and provides the raw information to guide
training and motivation. By identifying the strengths and weaknesses of
individual salespeople, training can be focused on the areas in need of
development, and incentives can be aimed at weak spots such as poor
prospecting performance.
Often performance will be compared using standards of performance such
as sales or profit quotas, although other comparisons, such as salesperson to
salesperson or current to past sales, are also used. Two types of performance
measure are used, based on quantitative and qualitative criteria:
1. Quantitative measures of performance may include sales revenue, profits
generated, gross profit margin, sales per active account, and number of new
accounts opened. Input criteria include number of calls and number of
prospects visited. These quantitative measures can be compared against
target figures to identify strengths and weaknesses. Many of the measures
are diagnostic, pointing to reasons why a target is not being reached (e.g. a
poor call rate might be a cause of low sales achievement). Measuring call
rate is important, as call frequency has been found to have a positive effect
on sales volume and customer satisfaction. Some results will merit
further investigation, for example a low prospecting success ratio
should prompt an examination of why new accounts are not being opened
despite the high number of prospects visited. A survey of evaluation metrics
has shown there is an increasing tendency to use profit-orientated criteria.
2. Qualitative measures of performance rely on soft data. They are intrinsically
more subjective and include assessment of:
sales skills, for example questioning and making presentations
customer relationships, for example how much confidence do customers
have in the salesperson and is rapport good
product knowledge, for example, how well informed the salesperson is
regarding the firm’s and competitors’ productsself-management, for example how well calls are prepared and routes
organized
cooperation and attitudes, for example the extent to which the salesperson
shows initiative or follows instructions.
An increasing number of firms are measuring their salespeople based on
the achievement of customer satisfaction. The use of quantitative and
qualitative measures is interrelated. For example, a poor sales per call ratio
will require a close qualitative assessment of sales skills, customer
relationships and product knowledge.
Exhibitions and Trade Fairs
Another element of the promotional mix that comes under the banner of direct
communications is trade fairs and exhibitions, which are a platform for
personal selling as well as other communication tools. Trade fairs (also known
as trade shows) and exhibitions offer marketing managers a unique opportunity
to engage with buyers, sellers and competitors under one roof. These types of
event are used in both industrial and consumer markets, but are highly
effective in the industrial buying process (Parasuraman 1981). Exhibitions
have been found to increase the effectiveness of personal selling activities
directly after the event (Smith et al. 2004). A key role of trade fairs and
exhibitions is to enable manufacturers, buyers, distributors, agents, present and
future customers, and media representatives to meet at a live event, which
often has restricted access for the trade. This type of event has a long heritage
and can be traced back more than 4,000 years. Trade fairs and exhibitions play
an important part in B2B trade and global economic growth (Sarmento and
Simões 2018).Exhibitions and trade fairs as part of the
communication mix
Good relationships are essential in industrial trade situations, and these types
of event have been found to be very useful for developing strong buyer–seller
relationships (Geigenmüller 2010). Trade fairs and exhibitions generally bring
together all the major players in an industry, and in so doing provide an
opportunity for buyers and sellers to engage across an industrial sector (see
Exhibit 15.3). There are many potential advantages, for example buyers may
spot new products, and firms can interact with other firms working in the same
industry, discuss issues and save money, as all firms are exhibiting in one
place. Other potential benefits are the potential to gather market intelligence
(Shipley and Wong 1993) about competitors and industry trends (Hansen
2004), and to exchange information and news about products, innovations,
promotions and new marketing strategies. Exhibitions and trade fairs are an
ideal arena in which to demonstrate a firm’s new products, and despite the high
cost associated with exhibiting, this is a widely used approach.
EXHIBIT 15.3

showcase events

Events vary in style depending on industry. For example, in the clothing
industry a week-long series of events is held in leading fashion capitals around
the world, such as New York, Paris, Milan and London. These events act as a
showcase for designers, highlight new trends and present new product ranges.Buyers from around the world join the designers and media page 621
representatives in visiting runway shows. These events reveal
cutting-edge designs that will shape what’s in and what’s out for the coming
season. For many designers, a key aim is to be outstanding, to maximize press
coverage.
Trade fair and exhibition objectives
Trade fairs are a means of extending a firm’s personal selling activities. There
are various objectives this element of the promotional mix can achieve and in
so doing contribute to an IMC strategy. Research suggests it is important to
consider whether objectives are selling or non-selling oriented, and whether
they are aimed at new or existing customers (Bonoma 1985; Sarmento and
Simões 2018). Selling objectives include:
generating leads/enquiries and a contact list
gaining access to key decision-makers
reaching an audience with a distinct interest in the market and the products
on display
creating awareness and developing relationships with new prospects
providing product and service demonstrations
launching new products and services
recruiting dealers or distributors
responding to customer account problems and strengthening existing
customer relationships
selling products and services.
Non-selling objectives include:
enhancing the firm’s image
evaluating reactions to new products
gathering market intelligence from competitors that are exhibiting
evaluating new products.
When developing objectives for an event, it is important to consider visitor
(buyer) objectives. The exhibition stand should be both functional and attract
attention. For example, regarding the simple logistics of the stand where the
buyer and seller interact, is there appropriate seating and are there
refreshments? To be effective, the stand should be attractive, facilitate contactbetween buyer and seller, and create an environment that enhances sales
conversions (Sarmento and Simões 2018).
Planning an exhibition
Success at an exhibition involves considerable pre-event planning. Clear
objectives should be set, selection criteria for evaluating exhibition attendance
determined, and design and promotional strategies decided. Pre-show
promotions to attract visitors to the stand include a website, social media,
direct mail and telemarketing; a personal sales call before the event or an
advertisement in the trade or technical press can be highly effective.
Because exhibitions and trade fairs bring together both customers and
competitors, a high degree of professionalism is required by staff who attend
an exhibition stand. Typically, such events should:
introduce innovative products and new ranges
exhibit a wider range of products, particularly large items that cannot be
demonstrated on a sales call
provide product and service expertise; event staff should be well informed
provide access to informative literature and links to follow-up resources
online
be a great customer experience, as this is an opportunity to showcase the
firm.
Trade fairs and exhibitions tend to be located where there are large
conference facilities with the necessary prestige to attract industry leaders. For
example, leading international auto shows are held in major cities such as
London, Beijing, Chicago and Berlin. Events can also be located close to the
centre of economic activity. For example, Slush is a fair that aims to bring
together technology entrepreneurs, start-ups and technology innovators from
across the world. Held annually in Helsinki, Finland, it brings together nearly
5,000 start-up businesses. The Nordic region is known for being a hotbed of
technological innovation, and many innovative products have emerged from
this region, from firms such as Rovio, Marimekko, Supercell and MySQL
(Slush 2022).
For an event to be successful, organizers have to ensure its location will be
suitable and sufficiently attractive to potential attendees. For example, the
organizers of the Spielwarenmesse international toy fair (Spielwarenmesse
n.d.) in Nüremberg, Germany, invest heavily to ensure that, at the end ofpage 622
January each year, more than 2,800 exhibitors and 76,000 trade visitors from
120 nations visit 12 exhibition halls at the fair (each dedicated to a different
type of toy-related product, such as dolls, hobbies, action toys, games,
educational) to see more than a million different products. Each
firm exhibiting at the fair has to put together its own event plan,
set objectives and decide how to allocate its budget to get best value. The fair
has many benefits, according to Pascal Bernard, CEO of French firm Juratoys:
‘Nüremberg is the place to be, since everyone is here. It is the only trade fair
where you meet everyone from everywhere. Our company is represented with
sales representatives from 50 countries here.’
Trade fairs and exhibitions also need to be held at a time in the calendar
when buyers are considering new products and suppliers can attend. For this
reason, the Nüremberg toy fair and others in this industry tend to be held in the
winter and spring, after the busy end-of-year trading period around the festive
season.
Evaluating an exhibition
Post-show evaluation will examine performance against objectives. This is a
learning exercise that will help a firm to judge whether the objectives were
realistic, how valuable the exhibition appears to have been and how well it was
represented.
Quantitative measures include:
number of visitors to the stand
number of key influencers/decision-makers who visited the stand
how many leads/enquiries were generated
cost per lead/enquiry
number and value of orders
cost per order
number of new distributorships opened/likely to be opened.
Other, more subjective, qualitative criteria include:
the worth of competitive intelligence
interest generated in new products
the cultivation of new/existing relationships
the value of customer query and complaint handling
the promotion of brand values.Sales and marketing departments may not always agree on the key
evaluation criteria to use. For example, sales may judge the exhibition on
number of leads, while marketing may prefer to judge it on the longer-term
issue of promotion of brand values. The most important consideration is to
measure variables that enable assessment against marketing objectives.
Therefore, since a major objective of many exhibitors is to stimulate leads and
enquiries, mechanisms must be in place to ensure these are followed up
promptly.
Ethical Issues in Direct
Communications
Personal selling and direct marketing methods are increasingly subject to
scrutiny by industry bodies, consumer groups, governments and, ultimately,
the national and international legal systems. Under the heading of personal
selling and sales management, Kadic-Maglajlic and colleagues (2019) suggest
three domains of ethical considerations that can impact on salespeople: the
industrial, organizational and personal levels.
Industrial-level deception: Industries are complex, and norms and values
vary. However, sooner or later, a dilemma facing most salespeople is the
choice of whether to tell the customer the whole truth and risk losing the
sale, or mislead them in order to clinch it. Acceptance of an industry-level
ethical stance is likely to prevail and inform individual behaviour. Deception
may take the form of exaggeration, lying or withholding important
information that significantly reduces the appeal of a product. Such actions
should be avoided by influencing salespersons’ behaviour through training,
by sales management encouraging ethical behaviour by their own actions
and words, and by establishing codes of conduct for their salespeople.
Nevertheless, sometimes evidence of malpractice in selling is discovered
across an industry and action taken to compensate the injured party. For
example, UK banks Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland
have set aside billions of pounds to compensate customers for mis-selling of
personal protection insurance on loans (Kadic-Maglajlic et al. 2019).
Organizational ethical climate: The values of an organization will shape
staff behaviours as they refer to the firms procedures and practices forpage 623
guidance. Bribery is the act of giving payment, gifts or other inducements to
secure a sale (sometimes referred to as lubrication), which can
speed up the sales process. Bribes are considered unethical, as they
violate the principle of fairness in commercial negotiations. Acts of
corruption are legally controlled in the UK, so when a senior manager at a
global soft drinks brand was found to be involved in influencing the
selection of subcontractors, fines and custodial sentences were issued. The
firm involved stated it was not aware of the situation but was eventually
convicted of failing to prevent bribery (CPS 2022). A major problem is, in
some countries, firms accept bribes and they are a part of business life: in
order to compete, bribes are necessary. Firms in such a situation face an
ethical dilemma: on the one hand, they will be castigated in their home
country if they use bribes and this becomes public knowledge; on the other
hand, without the bribe, the organization could be operating at a commercial
disadvantage. Taking an ethical stance may cause difficulties in the short
term, but in the long run the positive publicity that can follow is likely to be
of greater benefit.
Personal morality–the hard sell: Personal selling is criticized for employing
high-pressure sales tactics to close a sale. Car dealerships and the timeshare
industry have been deemed unethical in using hard-sell tactics to pressurize
customers into making a quick decision on a complicated purchase that may
involve expensive credit facilities. The extent to which an individual will
accept and deliver sales results under these terms will depend on their moral
belief systems.
Direct marketing methods also face different types of ethical issues
associated with consumer concerns:
Intrusive nature of telemarketing calls: Consumers complain about the
annoyance caused by unsolicited telephone calls pressuring them to buy
products at inconvenient times. Technological developments have the
capacity to take this to a new level–for example, with robo calls (via
computerized auto-diallers)–and while some countries legislate against this
style of communication, there are still some types of call that manage to
circumvent these controls.
Invasion of privacy: Many consumers fear every time they subscribe to a
website, club, society or magazine, apply for a credit card, or buy anything
by telephone or direct mail, their name, address and other information will
be entered into a database that will guarantee a flood of mail from the
supplier.page 624
The direct marketing industry and governments are responding to public
concerns such as those noted above.
Social media and targeted personal advertising also raise privacy concerns
(Mandal 2019). Firms engage in social media listening–tracking what
customers are saying publicly about products and services–but they must be
careful how they utilize customer data because although it is legally allowed
for marketers to mine publicly available data, there can be a significant
negative impact if social platform users develop negative attitudes (Jacobson et
al. 2020). Facebook was fined $5 billion in a privacy concerns case relating to
the harvesting of personal data using an online quiz (BBC 2019).
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapter Detailed Review
1. The key direct marketing communication tools: direct marketing, social media
personal selling, exhibitions and trade fairs
Direct marketing communications enable a direct dialogue between buyers and
sellers; moreover, they do not involve the purchase of media space. Direct
marketing is a means of creating a dialogue between buyers and sellers usingpage 625
various techniques such as direct mail, digital marketing, telemarketing and
catalogue marketing.
Social media increasingly offers scope for direct communications.
Personal selling allows buyers and the seller to communicate in a
face-to-face manner, which facilitates relationship development, but
from a marketing management perspective this is relatively costly.
Exhibitions and trade fairs offer an opportunity to bring together all of the buyers
and sellers in a particular market under one roof, and create an environment for
furthering customer relationships, enhancing corporate ideas and gathering
competitive information.
2. The meaning of direct marketing
Direct marketing is the distribution of products, information and promotional
benefits to target customers through interactive communication in a way that
allows response to be measured.
It includes such methods as direct mail, telemarketing, direct response advertising,
catalogue marketing and digital media.
3. The reasons for the growth of direct marketing activity
Direct marketing activity has grown because of market and media fragmentation,
developments in technology, the expansion of lists of potential clients,
sophisticated analytical techniques and coordinated marketing systems.
4. The importance of database marketing
Database marketing is an approach to marketing communications that targets
individuals using various media channels.
Databases are central to all forms of direct marketing activity as they store
customer contact and behavioural data, which aid marketing strategy and
planning, for example when planning promotional campaigns designed to target
very loyal customers who are to receive special treatment. Databases are useful
for planning campaigns as they hold details of past customer behaviour, such as
responses to price promotions.
5. How to manage a direct marketing campaign
A direct marketing campaign should not be designed in isolation but based on a
clear understanding of marketing strategy, in particular positioning. Then the steps
are as follows:
Identify and understand the target audience; never sell to a stranger. Who is to be
reached, their motives and choice criteria need to be understood.
Campaign objectives: these can be expressed in financial (e.g. sales), in
marketing (e.g. acquire or retain customers) or communication (e.g. change
beliefs) terms.
Media decisions: major media options are direct mail, telemarketing, mobile
marketing, direct response advertising, catalogue marketing and the internet.
Creative decisions: a creative brief will include a statement of communication
objectives, product benefits (and weaknesses), target market analysis,
development of the offer, communication of the message, and an action plan.page 626
Execute and evaluate the campaign: execution of the campaign may be in￾house or through the use of a specialist agency. Evaluation should take into
account defined objectives such as total sales, number of enquiries, cost per
sale and repeat purchase rate.
6. Social media
Social media is widely used in integrated multimedia campaigns across digital
media channels.
7. Personal selling and sales management
This is an important element of the direct communication mix and contributes
significantly to marketing strategies for many firms. Millions of people are engaged
in selling and each will generate revenue to support the functioning of other parts
of an organization. Building, transacting and managing relationships for mutual
benefit is at the heart of personal selling and traditionally involves face-to-face
contact with a customer.
8. Functions of personal selling
Personal selling enables individuals to interact and form bonds which can develop
into long-term relationships that are beneficial for all parties concerned, and can
be used for customer acquisition, retention and deletion, customer relationship
management, adding value, satisfying customer needs and creating customer
value.
9. Defining the strategic role of sales management
Success in selling comes from implementing the marketing concept
when face to face with customers; increasingly this involves building long-term
relationships with more emphasis on customer needs and wants, and less on
short-term sales transactions. Creating a customer-driven culture throughout the
firm, bringing together sales and marketing, is seen as best practice and should
help to define the strategic role of sales management.
10. Managing the sales force
The tasks of a sales manager are to: understand marketing strategy; set personal
selling objectives and strategies; design the sales force; manage the sales force
by setting objectives; organize recruitment and training; set reward structures and
performance measures for salespeople; and evaluate and control the total sales
operation.
11. Digitization of the sales force
Technology is changing sales practices and is used to supplement or even replace a
human sales force. Digitized sales can become a source of competitive advantage,
especially when used to provide deep insights into customer needs and wants, or to
build closer connected relationships and data-driven sales management decision￾making.
12. Developing business-to-business relationships
Customer relationships are becoming increasingly important in both business-to￾consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) markets. A key tool for
implementing relationship marketing is key account management (KAM), alsopage 627
known as corporate account management. In many industries, the use of KAM is
widespread and reflects the increasing concentration of buying power into fewer
but larger customers. Developing relationships with key accounts is often crucial to
the survival of a business. Key accounts are serviced by a key account sales
force, comprising senior salespeople who develop close personal relationships
with customers, can handle sophisticated sales arguments and are skilled at
negotiation.
13. Evaluation of the effectiveness of personal selling and sales management
Evaluation of the personal selling function should include assessment of the
quality of the function’s relationship with marketing and other organizational units.
14. The objectives, conduct and evaluation of exhibitions and trade fairs
Objectives of exhibitions and trade fairs can be classified as selling objectives in
the context of current customers (e.g. stimulate extra sales), selling objectives for
potential customers (e.g. determine needs and transmit benefits), non-selling
objectives for current customers (e.g. maintain image and gather competitive
intelligence) and non-selling objectives for potential customers (e.g. foster image￾building and gather competitive intelligence).
Staff conduct at an exhibition should ensure there is always someone in
attendance to talk to visitors. Staff should be well informed and able to provide
informative literature; a seating area/office and refreshments should be provided.
Evaluation of an exhibition/trade fair includes number of visitors/key
influencers/decision-makers who visit the stand, number of
leads/enquiries/orders/new dealerships generated and cost per lead/enquiry/order.
Qualitative evaluation includes the worth of competitive intelligence and interest
generated in new products.
15. Ethical issues in direct communications
Using direct communication tools can mean marketing managers face difficult
choices. Personal selling has been criticized at three levels–industry, organization
and individual–for various ethical issues, such as deception, bribery and hard-sell
tactics in order to secure sales orders. Direct marketing tools can be seen by
customers as poorly targeted, a waste of natural resources and an invasion of
privacy. Social media also face concerns over privacy and the mining of personal
data.

AIRBNB: BELONG
ANYWHERE
Introduction
Airbnb was founded in San Francisco by Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia. It is a community
marketplace that allows property owners and travellers to connect with one another, via website
or mobile applications, to rent out and stay in properties, respectively. The company began in
late 2007 when its founders, struggling to pay for their shared apartment in San Francisco,
decided to rent out airbeds to conference attendees. Cleverly, they provided breakfast cereals
that were custom-branded to suit the convention their guests were attending, such as ‘Obama
Os’ for the Obama convention. They quickly recruited other accommodation providers and
started a basic website. Their entrepreneurial spirit captured a lot of attention and resulted in
their securing significant investment from venture capitalists such as movie star Ashton Kutcher
and music manager Guy Oseary. This investment enabled the company to process customer
rental payments, and by 2012 the website had processed more than 10 million bookings.
Today, Airbnb provides a flexible and cost-effective form of accommodation for millions of
leisure and business travellers around the world. Airbnb’s business model is simple: it earns
revenue by charging service fees to both guests and hosts. The cost to the renter of Airbnb
lodgings is determined by the property owner. By not directly owning physical locations, Airbnb
has been able to quickly scale its business to accommodate growing demand. In 2022, the
company offered more than 7 million listings in 100,000-plus cities across 220 countries. Airbnb
surpassed competitors such as Booking.com, Hotels.com and Marriott International in web
traffic and is valued at $38 billion worldwide–a similar amount to the Marriott hotel group, even
though it does not own any of its properties (Deane 2022). Although the global Covid-19
pandemic had a serious impact on businesses around the world, in 2022 Airbnb’s net revenuepage 632
was projected to be as much as $8.5 billion (Macrotrends 2022). The rise of Airbnb can be
attributed in part to its innovative direct marketing communications.
Target Audience
Airbnb has always defined its core audience, ‘head-first explorers’ (younger millennials), as a
psychographic consumer segment that drives its business. Millennials account for
approximately 60 per cent of all guests. This market segment consists of travellers looking for a
spacious and comfortable place to stay that is also affordable and functional. In Europe and the
US, Airbnb is typically 8–17 per cent cheaper than a regional hotel’s average daily rate. The
fastest-growing Airbnb host demographic is seniors, with more than 200,000 senior hosts
(senior women are also consistently rated as the best hosts on Airbnb). Although Airbnb
traditionally has mostly leisure travellers, who account for 90 per cent of its bookings, the
company is now anxious to breach that ceiling and acquire more business travellers.
Additionally, the company wants to expand its market reach to connect with groups outside its
usual millennial demographic, such as young families and LGBT couples.
The ‘Live There’ Approach
According to Airbnb, 86 per cent of its customers choose the platform because they want to
experience the world like locals when travelling, and the idea of living somewhere rather than
visiting inspires the company’s marketing strategies. The marketing message captures the idea
that people shouldn’t simply go to a new place–they should live there, even if only for one night.
Airbnb uses a multifaceted direct marketing communications approach to raise awareness of
the ‘Live There’ message, and to increase direct dialogue between buyers and sellers. Four
media channels are used to target individuals: the Airbnb website, its app, email marketing and
social media (for example, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and TikTok). To ensure high￾quality imagery and content across all communications, the company has
established a network of more than 3,000 freelance photographers across six
continents. Any user wishing to list a room on the platform can request a free visit from one of
these professional photographers (Rastogi 2016).
The Airbnb Website
The Airbnb website, while primarily an accommodation search and reservation site, has evolved
significantly over the years, providing a suite of useful features for travellers. The Airbnb
guidebooks are both curated by Airbnb staff and populated with local information from Airbnb
hosts. Guidebook content is significantly user generated, meaning that hosts can provide very
personal representations of a particular location, and this, in turn, feeds into the whole ‘Live
There’ ethos. Airbnb’s underlying technology parses through these guidebooks and compiles
top-ten lists per location, based on provided content and traveller reviews. The Airbnb
guidebooks allow visitors to get a taste of what day-to-day life is like for people who actually live
in the location. Another element is the Airbnb neighbourhood guides–these are created by
Airbnb staff and focus on only the 23 largest conurbations where Airbnb hosts are in
abundance. Local photographers are utilized to lend authenticity to the content presented in
these guides, which again feeds into the ‘Live There’ concept. To further enhance direct
communication with users, Airbnb launched ‘Trips’ to allow travellers to book individual
experiences (salsa dancing, yoga, etc.) in the locations to which they are travelling. These
customized trips are promoted to the client on the Airbnb website, in Facebook live feeds, viapage 633
the app, by email and by mini-movies akin to trailers. To increase engagement among the host
community, Airbnb provides a ‘Learn about Airbnb’ section on its website. This enables potential
hosts to quickly understand how the Airbnb systems work and how they can benefit from joining
the service.
The company tackles the issue of ‘browser abandonment’, which effectively means a user
closing out of the Airbnb website after looking at a city without making a purchase decision.
Airbnb’s technology recognizes this behaviour and sends a direct personalized email to the
user with tailored content suggesting places to stay and fantastic activities in the city in question
(Connaughton 2019). Additionally, once a user books a stay on Airbnb they are sent another
personalized email asking them to refer a friend, and cross-selling experiences such as local
trips and outings.
Mobile App
Airbnb’s mobile app presents users with a simple interface that is personalized to user
preferences, history and context (e.g. directions from their current location to their selected
accommodation). The app provides trip-planning information, and its goal is to become the de
facto travel planning tool for users. Leveraging Airbnb’s strong social community, with the help
of celebrity endorsements, was critical when launching the app. Celebrities such as Beyoncé,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Kendall Jenner and Ashton Kutcher supported this process. For example,
Gwyneth Paltrow took to Instagram to enthuse about her accommodation, stating ‘Airbnb who
knew?? Such a beautiful trip. Adios Vallarta. Hasta la proxima!’ (which translates to ‘Goodbye.
See you next time’). The company continuously listens to its users and provides updates to its
mobile service to meet their requirements. Airbnb ensures that every new app release is
accompanied by a detailed blog post that explains any updates, always keeping the customer
informed.
Email Marketing
Airbnb uses email marketing to help facilitate the conversation between hosts and guests. A
personalized email is sent to both hosts and guests to welcome them to Airbnb and to alert
them when they have new messages. The company includes attention-grabbing subject lines,
such as ‘Imagine yourself here’, with an accompanying image featuring a unique and
interesting destination. In 2021, Airbnb noticed that people were posting and searching for
short-term rentals on Craigslist. Accordingly, the team created a piece of software code that
would automatically send a direct targeted email to Craigslist users whenever they posted a
new rental, to encourage them to join the Airbnb network. Once it automated the process this
led to viral growth. In addition, in order to push adverts towards a larger audience, Airbnb
decided to attract qualified leads and reverse-engineered the Craigslist form to make the two
platforms talk to each other. This resulted in an option for Airbnb hosts to instantly post to
Craigslist whenever they added a new listing. As a result, the user was able to build more
backlinks to Airbnb, which in turn increased the site’s exposure (Clary 2021).
Airbnb also encourages its users to invite potential new members via email. When new
members complete their first trip, the referrers received a $25 travel credit, and when they hostfor the first time, they received a $75 travel credit. This allows Airbnb to convert new leads and
pay referral fees only after new users pay, and ensures the company’s growth is sustainable.
This referral marketing strategy has proved hugely successful for Airbnb as results show that:
four times as many people will make a purchase after hearing about Airbnb from a friend
people put more faith in the advice of their friends than they do in online advertisements (92
per cent vs 33 per cent)
referrals from satisfied customers increase sales by three to five times more than any other
marketing method used by Airbnb (Sapien 2019).
Social Media
Airbnb won the Twitter #creativity award for its #LiveInTheMovies initiative. Through an analysis
of social media conversations during the 2015 Oscars, the company discovered that the chat
on Twitter spiked during commercial breaks. Airbnb created a short animated movie, released a
week before the 2016 Oscars, which asked consumers to imagine what movie they would like
to live in. As Twitter users tweeted about their favourite movie locations, Airbnb’s social media
team responded to each directly with a property listing to match the movie location or theme.
For example, for Jurassic Park fans, a remote island off Costa Rica was highlighted. This early
targeting enabled Airbnb to capture an audience prior to the event. As the Oscars progressed,
Airbnb live-tweeted the event and, using social listening tools, matched tweets and winning
films to locations in real time. The result of this innovative drive was the creation of 63 million
Twitter impressions (the total number of times a tweet was seen by individual users on the
Twitter platform), 1.3 million video views, 6.5 times the number of new Twitter followers versus
daily average, and the placement of Airbnb as number two in visibility on Twitter compared with
Oscars sponsors and paid advertisers. Additionally, #LiveInTheMovies resulted in more user￾generated content (UGC) than for any other brand during the Oscars.
In 2020, Airbnb created a comprehensive customer service guide through the ‘@Airbnb Help’
account. In conjunction with this, Airbnb utilizes Twitter as a customer service tool. Twitter is the
optimal medium for support communications due to the rapidity and shortness of its exchanges,
and its ability to directly engage consumers. Beyond Twitter, Airbnb utilizes additional social
media platforms as part of its direct marketing communications. For example, the company
uses Instagram to showcase the remarkable and unusual houses featured on the service.
Airbnb’s Instagram grid is filled with aspirational images of vacation homes that are more likely
to be shared than the typical hotel image or even some of Airbnb’s own more generic listings.
The bulk of these articles are UGC videos displaying lodging options and accompanying
activities, and many are provided by travel influencers. UGC entails that consumers publish
their contact with a company’s product or service, which is often searchable through a hashtag
on social media networks. In 2022, the Airbnb hashtag had more than 7 million Instagram
photos from clients. Due to its influence and perceived consumer value, the firm uses a
substantial amount of this material on its own website (Percival 2022). Furthermore, Airbnb’s
Instagram postings are integrated with a technology called ‘Shoppable’, which enables viewers
to click through on a post to access property listings and booking systems (Hogan 2018).
In late 2022, Airbnb officially joined TikTok to provide its community with more ways to learn
about its marketplace, and to enable them to share their experiences with other travellers. In
addition, Airbnb uses Pinterest to provide hosting tips, travel checklists, ‘must-do’ experiences,
travel recommendations and road trip ideas illustrated with photographs. While Airbnb first
utilized the same material on Pinterest as it did on other platforms–namely photographs of the
properties featured on its website–it has now expanded into more interactive content such as
click-through advertising (Percival 2022).page 634

BILLIE EILISH:
LEVERAGING THE
PERSONAL ANTI-BRAND
ACROSS DIGITAL MEDIA
Introduction
Singer-songwriter Billie Eilish was born in Los Angeles, CA, in 2001. From an early age her
family encouraged her to be unique in her outlook, and to go deeper into music and explore the
art form. She wrote her first song at the age of 11 and was just 14 when Apple Music signed her
to A&R company Platoon, which specializes in packaging emerging artists before they get a
major-label contract.Source: DFree/Shutterstock
The singer’s unconventional style–oversized clothing, bright colours and unusual accessories–
serves to define her as someone who is fiercely independent and uncaring as to external
perceptions. According to Eilish, ‘I never want the world to know everything about me. I mean,
that’s why I wear big, baggy clothes. Nobody can have an opinion because they haven’t seen
what’s underneath, you know?’ (Pierce 2022). Her music moves away from the 90s angsty
grunge ethos to a more understated form, with a focus on sadness, trust, joy and anticipation,
speaking directly to her fan base in terms and emotions they can relate to. This individualism
and authenticity is key to the success of Eilish and other artists such as Post Malone and The
Kid Laroi. Eilish’s music strategy is to release more singles than albums, in an attempt to
constantly produce new material, and this strategy is reflected in her digital marketing
campaigns, which provide fresh new content on a high-frequency basis (Sudjono 2020).
This case study examines Billie Eilish’s digital marketing strategy across multiple media, and
discusses how consistency of message and style creates a marketing tour de force.
Consistency of Image Across Multiple Channels
Having just turned 18, Eilish scooped five Grammys at the 2020 awards ceremony, including
Best Pop Vocal Album, Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Album of the
Year. On the surface, Eilish appears to be yet another alternative mega pop star, but this is
underpinned by a strong self-promotion digital marketing strategy that talks to Generation Z in
their own language regardless of communication platform (Hardiman 2021).
Her personal website draws visitors into a virtual bedroom adorned with cartoon-style drawings
and abstract ornaments, where users can access tour details, music videos, social media andpage 636
merchandise (Tinubu 2021). Her social media acts as a collaborative and adaptive platform for
dialogue between Eilish and her fans. Her unique approach carries over directly in all her social
media campaigns, with posts presenting an almost casual, conversational style, giving fans the
feeling that she is talking directly to them. For example, Eilish’s Instagram fan base grew from a
modest 275,000 in 2017 to just over 105 million in 2022. Following her Grammy award sweep
she simply posted ‘FIVE ARE YOU KIDDING’, resulting in more than 14 million
likes. Everything she does feeds into her personal brand–making her uniquely
identifiable and relatable to her followers.
Eilish’s TikTok debut was unorthodox. A simple video shot on her phone and put on the TikTok
account ‘CoochieDestroyer5’ was all it took for her to launch a hugely successful TikTok
campaign. With no pre-launch media hype, the clip rapidly went viral among her admirers. It
took only a few days to gain millions of fans and millions of hearts on her TikTok account. In
terms of content, videos were constructed so they were perceived as being genuine and
authentic, directly targeting her loyal fan base (Davie 2020). Rather than jumping into selling
merchandise or getting followers to click links, the approach taken was to develop an emotional
connection with her fan base. Consistent engagement–often commenting on their posts and
responding to DMs–is key to her approach to building strong relationships. Eilish comments ‘I
love my fans. I talk to each and every one of them as much as I can, and I respond to all of their
DM’s—or at least I try to—and I comment on and like all their stuff. And Twitter is just my brain
in one’ (Pierce 2022).
Leveraging Social Initiatives
For International Youth Day, during the Covid pandemic, Eilish collaborated with
telecommunications powerhouse Deutsche Telecom and Saatchi & Saatchi London to launch
the #WhatWeDoNext digital campaign on YouTube, which celebrated the amazing things young
people are doing with technology. The campaign aimed to break the stereotype that young
people uselessly spend too much time on their phones. Featuring Eilish alongside a team of six
digital trailblazers, the innovative ways were highlighted in which this generation of digital
natives are leveraging technology to benefit society at large. These digital leaders were united
by a common purpose–whether they are DJs, sustainable fashion designers or activists for
equality and human rights, they are also fostering technological innovation, and raising
awareness of human rights and climate change. According to the campaign’s tagline, in order to
create a better society, major milestones such as legislative shifts and social revolutions are
required. Sharing the work of LGBTQ+ artists, donating to charity or going vegan for a day with
a buddy are all ways the campaign promoted the road to a brighter future, and enabled
participants to join the movement through digital media (Reid 2020). One of the key objectives
of this campaign was to provide a platform for young people to voice their opinions and suggest
ideas for improvement, thus fostering fan engagement (Think with Google 2021).
Across Multiple Media
Eilish ensures her content appears across multiple channels. Her songs, for example, feature in
the Just Dance series of video games, including the title track she sang for the most recent
Bond movie No Time to Die. She has also completed vocals for TV shows such as 13 Reasons
Why. Combining this with her strategy of releasing music across many channels, such as Apple
Music, Tidal, Spotify, Amazon Music, Soundcloud and traditional radio, ensures her digital
presence is pervasive (Sudjono 2020). In 2021, Eilish teamed up with Amazon to produce a
Prime Day show that premiered on Amazon Prime and subsequently on Amazon Music, IMDbpage 637
TV, and Twitch, to showcase an abundance of her music and merchandise. Following this,
Amazon released a Billie Eilish branded version of its Alexa smart speaker. This digital
campaign resulted in billions of views on TikTok (as part of the Billie Eilish hashtag challenge)
and generated more than 62,000 new followers for the Amazon Music TikTok account. As a by￾product, the campaign generated 1,300-plus pieces of press coverage globally (Sandbox
2021).

istribution, channel management and retailing, along with location of
services, makes up the place element of the marketing mix. Products need
to be available in adequate quantities, in convenient locations and at times
when customers want to buy them. In this chapter, we examine the functions
and types of distribution channels, the key decisions that determine channel
strategy, and how to manage channels to achieve these goals. We also explorethe relevance of place in terms of where goods are purchased, by looking at
the retail industry and the importance of multichannel distribution.
Manufacturers and producers should consider not only the needs of their
ultimate customer but also the requirements of channel intermediaries (the
organizations facilitating the distribution of products to end consumers). Kick
Start is a programme developed by Lidl to help Irish food and drink producers
sell to the discount retailer. Lidl’s supplier development scheme even invests
up to €200,000 to support the manufacture and branding of products. Since
2017 Lidl has invested €6 million in Irish supplier businesses (e.g. Fused stir￾fry sauces, Killowen gin) (Lidl 2022).
Establishing distribution through a supply chain that is efficient and meets
customers’ needs is vital to marketing success. The supply chain is often
referred to as a channel of distribution and is how products are moved from
original producer to final customer. Logistics is a related term, which refers to
the movement of goods through the supply chain; this function has become
increasingly complex as retailers serve their customers through multiple
channels: offline, online, click and collect, and remote collection points such
as Amazon lockers. Good management of channels of distribution is important,
as this can influence the choice of supplier when making buying decisions in
B2B markets (see Chapter 4 for further details). Choosing the most effective
channel of distribution is a key aspect of marketing strategy, as this can create
the competitive advantage needed to outperform competitors. Furthermore,
distribution channels consist of networks of firms, which need to be aligned to
enable the transition of goods from end to end. This means developing good
buyer–supplier relationships, streamlining the transition of goods, and creating
cost-effective and value-creating supplier networks (Kumar and Rahman
2016).
Events in the marketing environment can seriously disrupt distribution,
which can then affect a firm’s performance and that of all channel members.
The global pandemic, for instance, caused major disruptions to supply and
demand as local and global communities struggled to find new ways of
working and transferring goods across global supply chains, and end
consumers began panic-buying available goods. However, this unprecedented
global event caused firms to reassess the viability of their supply chains, and
find new strategies and new partners to fit with government restrictions and
changing consumer behaviour. In general this led to more goods being
purchased online (Sharma et al. 2022). For example, Deliveroo, a food
delivery service operating in cities across the UK and Europe, providing cyclepage 641
and car delivery services, partnered with leading food retailers (e.g.
Sainsbury’s, Lidl, Morrisons) to deliver groceries, instead of the normal fast￾food deliveries (Pavlou and Georgiou 2021). This was originally developed as
a short-term solution, but consumers’ expectations have been more
permanently raised, and they continue to want their deliveries to arrive in a
shorter time frame. To address this, grocery retailers initially partnered with
Getir, Weezy and Whoosh (during the pandemic), as well as Deliveroo, to get
items delivered within a one-hour time window (Dunsby et al. 2022). Post￾pandemic, demand altered and the newer, smaller providers suffered. However,
speeding up delivery times has meant supermarkets have made structural
changes (e.g. extending click and collect zones, converting stores into order￾processing centres), which has created efficiency gains as well as new
marketing opportunities. Large retailers, such as Asda and Amazon, have
added ‘express delivery’ as a new service option (Nazir 2022).
Digital channels are making other changes to distribution channels and
buyer–supplier relationships. The change is from physical to virtual delivery
channels, for example the distribution of music and video (downloads), airline
bookings (electronic ticketing) and hotel reservations (electronic booking).
Increasingly, retailers are adopting a multichannel or omnichannel approach
(see the later discussion in this chapter), which means supplying products and
communicating with customers in-store, online, via mobile and through social
media. This has led to a proliferation of new types of digital intermediaries and
enablers, which aid the transition of goods at various points across a
distribution channel. For example, Shopify (see Exhibit 16.1) is an e￾commerce enabler platform, founded and developed by Tobias
Lütke and Scott Lake when they wanted to sell snowboarding kit
online and couldn’t find a suitable web solution. The platform they developed
provides ready-made frameworks, which allow retailers to easily create their
own online stores, payment systems and logistics (Wikipedia 2022). Read

MatchesFashion.com Partners With Designers to
Deliver Luxury Fashion
MatchesFashion.com was established in 1987, in a bricks-and-mortar store in Wimbledon,
UK, selling luxury brands to high-value customers. And while it took until 2007 to launch
online, the brand led the way for other luxury fashion retailers to follow to the web and
multichannel retailing. Over the following 10 years, the firm developed its retail proposition,
putting the customer first and selling designer labels from Gucci to Burberry. It developed a
multichannel retail network to include 14 stores across London, and also built a successful
e-commerce operation serving international markets.
Source: New Africa/Shutterstockpage 642
Multichannel expansion
As the business grew, most of the trade was in online sales (80 per cent of total sales), with
55 million visitors a year from its 176 international markets. The brand maintained physical
stores in high-profile locations in the UK as a constant connection with its target customers
at home. MatchesFashion.com became a model example of a business utilizing the benefits
of digital channels and new modes of marketing, using style influences to bring together
collections of fashion in shoppable blog posts and 24/7 online style and fashion advice. This
creative use of digital marketing channels boosted the business even further, to 95 per cent
of trade online.
Turbulent times
In 2017, founders Ruth and Tom Chapman sold the firm to Apax Partners. In new hands
and with new leadership in the form of Ajay Kavan (an ex-Amazon executive who launched
Amazon Fresh in the UK, Europe and Japan), MatchesFashion.com looked set to expand
its e-commerce operation, but Kavan was to leave after just a year, having set clear goals
for the brand. Despite this, sales had begun to decline. Several leadership changes and
times of uncertainty about the survival of the firm followed. Then there was the shock of
Covid, and MatchesFashion.com found its luxury fashion buying customers were swapping
designer brands for leisurewear, seeing sales decline further.
Brighter future
In 2022, Nick Beighton (ex-ASOS executive) took over the leadership of
MatchesFashion.com and even through there are still challenges–stabilizing the business,
bringing it back to profit and developing a clear strategy that will enable the brand to grow–
the brand has the strengths and opportunities of its multichannel operation to leverage for
further growth.
The strengths of the brand are:
Channel relationships–partnering with more than 450 established and new designers,
the brand has influence in the luxury fashion trade, which has enabled it to open
franchise operations in designer stores.
Service and customer experience–shoppers have access to stylists 24/7 online and in
its flagship store in Carlos Place, London, while personal shoppers, events and an
exclusive café all enhance the shopping experience.
A network of influencers and fashion bloggers tell stories of fashion and style through
their shoppable posts to inform luxury fashion buyers’ decision-making (e.g. Spanish
model and influencer Gala Gonzales).
Opportunities for improving channel operations include:
Investment in technical systems–back-office systems, infrastructure and warehousing to
ensure seamless shopping via all channels; development of website and app; each
channel is intuitive and responsive to customer needs.
International growth–much of the business already comes from international segments,
but there is scope for further investment in marketing events to increase engagement
and spend.
MatchesFashion.com has grown and survived over 35 years, but the next five may prove
the most challenging yet as the retail industry (in the UK, at least) recalibrates. Covid-19,the cost of living crisis, Brexit, political tension, climate change and the growth of digital
channels are just a few of the external forces affecting supply chains and reshaping
retailing.
To survive and thrive in this market climate, MatchesFashion.com will need to continue to
leverage advantage from its strengths and realize its opportunities. This can be helped by
having consistent leadership, a clear vision and mission, and delivering on its promises
regarding channel operations, which will help to refocus its product ranges and protect the
brand from aggressive competitors such as Farfetch and Net-a-Porter in luxury fashion
markets.

Next, we explore the functions of distribution channel intermediaries, after
which we examine the different types of channels manufacturers can use to
supply their products to end customers.
Functions of Channel Intermediaries
When deciding on a channel strategy–whether to sell direct to the end
customer or to use channel intermediaries such as retailers and/or wholesalers–
we need to understand the functions of channel intermediaries and the benefits
that can be derived. Channel intermediaries add value by providing useful
functions as goods pass along the supply chain. These functions reconcile the
needs of participants in the supply network, improve efficiency (e.g. by
reducing the number of transactions or breaking bulk (reducing the stock
volume), improving accessibility, expanding location reach and cutting time
gaps between manufacturer and end customer) and provide specialist services.
Each of these functions is now examined in more detail.
Reconciling the needs of producers and
consumerspage 643
Manufacturers typically produce a large quantity of a limited range of goods,
whereas consumers and businesses usually want only a limited quantity of a
wide range of goods (Coughlan et al. 2005). The role of channel intermediaries
is to reconcile these conflicting situations and develop strategies that add value
and deliver benefit. For example, a manufacturer of electrical white goods sells
to retailers. The manufacturer can gain economies of scale by producing large
quantities of a product and then selling to many of these firms further along the
supply chain (e.g. AO, Currys, Amazon). Each retailer can then offer its
customers a wide assortment of products in one location (physical, digital or
both). It is important to remember the key function of channel intermediaries is
breaking bulk. A wholesaler may buy large quantities from a manufacturer
(perhaps a container load) and then sell smaller quantities (such as by the case)
to retailers. Alternatively, large retailers such as supermarkets buy large
quantities from producers and break bulk by splitting the order between
outlets. In this way, producers make large quantities while consumers are
offered limited quantities at the point of purchase. But there are also other
combinations for using channels.
Improving efficiency
Channel intermediaries can improve distribution efficiency by reducing the
number of transactions and creating bulk for transportation. Figure 16.1
shows a basic model of how the number of transactions between three
producers and three customers is reduced by using one intermediary.
Direct distribution to customers results in nine transactions, whereas
the use of an intermediary cuts the number of transactions to six. Distribution
(and selling) costs and effort, therefore, are reduced.
FIGURE 16.1
How a channel intermediary improves distribution efficiencySmall producers can benefit by selling to intermediaries, which then
combine many small purchases into bulk for transportation. Without the
intermediary, it may prove too costly for each small producer to meet
transportation costs to the consumer. Agricultural products such as fruit and
vegetables (e.g. green beans from Kenya, pineapples and bananas from Central
America) are grown by small producers, who sometimes benefit from this
arrangement.
Furthermore, environmental and sustainability efficiencies are becoming
prevalent. The environment, climate change and changing consumer
behaviours have implications for channel intermediaries in terms of making
their operation sustainable and finding ways to join the circular economy. For
example, The Body Shop (beauty and cosmetics) and Pizza Hut (pizzas) are
offering end-consumers the opportunity to return empty packaging, while
electrical retailers AO and Currys have large recycling and repair operations
(Dunsby et al. 2022).
Improving accessibilitypage 644
Two major divides need to be bridged between producers and consumers: the
location gap and the time gap. The location gap derives from the geographic
separation of producers from the customers they serve. Many of the cars
produced in the UK by Nissan and Toyota are exported to Europe. Car dealers
in Europe provide customer access to these cars in the form of display and test￾drive facilities, and the opportunity to purchase locally rather than deal direct
with the producer thousands of miles away. Digital channels (web, mobile apps
and social media) are reducing the location gap, allowing buyers to purchase
without the need to visit a producer or distributor. Producers can play their part
in improving accessibility by making consumers aware of the location of their
distributors.
The time gap results from discrepancies between when a manufacturer
wants to produce goods and when consumers wish to buy. For example,
manufacturers of spare parts for cars may wish to run their manufacturing
processes from Monday to Friday, but shoppers may wish to
purchase goods every day of the week. By opening at the
weekend, car accessory outlets bridge the time gap between production and
consumption. Digital channels have facilitated 365/24/7 buying, which is
streamlining communications throughout global supply chains. This is also
very popular in consumer markets.
The ‘last mile conundrum’ is a related to the location gap, especially when
using digital channels and associated intermediaries. Retailers are again
finding increasingly innovative ways to resolve logistics in this small (in terms
of distance) but very important part of the supply chain: getting goods to the
end consumer, for example opening mini-warehouses which serve a local area.
Amazon has been hoovering up premises left vacant on high streets by
collapsed retail chains that have gone out of business, to use for storage or
warehousing. Using ‘dark stores’, as this approach is known, is a tactic also
practised by grocery retailers. Dark stores deliver many operational benefits:
they are closer to customers (important when delivering chilled and frozen
goods), minimize delivery costs for the retailer and increase the efficiency of
‘picking’ goods for customer orders (Dunsby et al. 2022).
Read Marketing in Action 16.1 to find out how Shein Fashion is shipping
direct from China and overcoming both the location and time gaps.MARKETING IN ACTION 16.1
Shein Fashion: Shipping Direct From China
The Shein app has been downloaded more than 230 million times. It belongs to a Chinese
fashion e-commerce retailer, which ships direct to the end consumer. Typically goods can
take months to arrive in the UK and Europe from China due to the time taken by bulk
logistics modes of transport (container ships and trains). But Shein gets its goods from
China to these markets quickly, typically within two to three weeks. This is achieved through
an agile network of suppliers, a three-day turnaround for new products (placing heavy
demands on suppliers to deliver to very short timelines) and shipping direct to the end
consumer.

The brand has gained popularity with young fashion buyers in Europe and the US, and has
overtaken Amazon to become the world’s largest online-only fashion retailer, with a turnover
of £10 billion. It is TikTok’s most talked about fashion brand and adds around 3,000 new
styles to its app every week, to ensure the conversations keep flowing. It has an innovative
business model: on demand. Products are manufactured in small batches, and production
is increased only according to demand. As a result, the firm produces less waste.
Algorithms and data analysts trawl worldwide fashion publications for the latest trends,
which enables Shein to add something new every day.
Supply chain relationships and management are important for operational success. Shein
uses technology to manage the logistics of its goods, and constantly monitors
manufacturing and outputs from suppliers. In return, suppliers are paid promptly (which is
not always the case in this region). To succeed, suppliers must locate close to Shein’s
sourcing hub in Guangzhou, China, and meet tight delivery lead times: typically 3–10 days
from concept to delivery. Operationally, this is much faster than Zara, which typically allows
five weeks.
Social media is central to Shein’s communication and growth, with nearly 22 million
followers on Instagram and nearly 3 million on TikTok. ‘Haul’ videos are regularly shared on
social media, showing how many items can be bought for $100.page 645
The brand’s operations have raised ethical issues relating to modern slavery, employee
rights and pay, and the sustainability of its business model. It is also looking for ways to
improve its customer service record, which is poor. None of which has got in the way of it
becoming a leading global teen brand.
Based on: Hanbury (2021); Pinnock (2021); Dunsby et al. (2022)
Perishable goods are susceptible to both time and location gaps. For
example, the Norwegian seafood industry consists of many micro-enterprises,
located far from international markets, where its goods are consumed. To
overcome this, and the fragmented nature of the Norwegian fishing industry,
some fishermen have developed a ‘Tinder’ approach to buyer–seller
exchanges. Drawing an analogy from the online dating app, the principles are
based on finding a match, aligning choice criteria and making a casual
exchange. Due to the high level of uncertainty of product availability, and
global demand, casual relationships created in the moment (rather than more
traditional relational or transitional relationships) afford the micro-business
greater flexibility and stability when faced with the unpredictability of the
industry (Nyu et al. 2022).
Providing specialist services
Channel intermediaries can perform specialist customer services
manufacturers may feel ill equipped to provide themselves. Distributors may
have long-standing expertise in such areas as selling, servicing and installation
to customers. Producers may feel such functions are better handled by channel
intermediaries so they can specialize in other aspects of manufacturing and
marketing activity.
Types of Distribution Channel
Everything we buy, whether consumer goods or business-to-business goods or
services, requires a channel of distribution. Business channels can be shorter
than consumer channels because of the small number of ultimate customers,the greater geographic concentration of customers, and the greater complexity
of the products that require close producer–customer liaison. Service channels
also tend to be short, because of the intangibility of services and the need for
personal contact between service provider and consumer.
Consumer channels
Figure 16.2 shows four alternative consumer channels. Each is described
briefly below.
FIGURE 16.2
Distribution channels for consumer goods
Producer direct to consumer
Cutting out distributor profit margin may make this option attractive to
producers, as they can sell direct to consumers. Many firms, from men’s
outfitters such as Charles Tyrwhitt and fashion multinational Inditex (Zara) to
iTunes and Dell Computers, have adopted this approach. Digital channels
provide the technology infrastructure to supply consumers direct rather than
through retailers.page 646
Eliminating a layer of intermediaries from a distribution channel is called
disintermediation (Mills and Camek 2004). This is a term that was coined in
the banking industry with the advent of retail banking. The basic idea is that
the ‘middleman’ is removed and manufacturers sell direct to consumers. But
this is also occurring at other stages in the supply chain; Amazon, eBay and
ASOS, for example, refine their business models and streamline supply chains
by eliminating intermediaries between themselves and the end consumer. This
trend, adopted by many online retailers, has gone a step further by reducing the
need for physical stores, which is leading to the closure of many traditional
high-street retail brands (Bhaiya 2017; Ellis-Chadwick 2018). Examples in
other industries include airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair, which have
moved towards internet bookings, eliminating the need to go through a travel
agent, and Dell Computers, which has largely eliminated retailers from the
traditional PC distribution channel. A broader definition of disintermediation
includes the displacement of traditional channel intermediaries with new forms
of distribution. For example, iTunes and Spotify online music stores are
replacing specialist record shops in the distribution of music.
Disintermediation occurs when a new type of channel intermediary or structure
serves customers better than the old channels. Spotify and Last.fm provide
access to almost limitless musical choice through streaming technology for a
small monthly fee. YouTube provides a distribution platform for new recording
artists.
At the opposite end of the spectrum is reintermediation. In this case,
retailers use digital channels for different purposes, ranging from a simple
poster website advertising the firm to a fully integrated online business
operation that facilitates online sales, builds customer relationships, and acts as
a portal for new business opportunities. Research suggests retailers may not
have the in-house skills and technical resources required to develop their
online presence, so web service providers act as ‘cyber intermediaries’,
designing, developing, hosting and managing retailers’ websites. Adding this
extra level in the supply chain enables retailers to exploit the potential of the
internet by using third-party web service providers who have the technical
expertise and knowledge necessary for all the retailer’s online business
requirements. Many retailers are taking this action to protect their investment
in increasingly competitive and challenging online trading environments. Theyalso try to build strong collaborative relationships with their web service
providers (Doherty and Ellis-Chadwick 2010; Vize et al. 2010).
Producer to retailer to consumer
The growth in retailer size means it is economical for producers to supply
retailers directly rather than through wholesalers. Supermarket chains such as
Sainsbury’s exercise considerable power over manufacturers because of their
enormous buying capabilities. However, technology has created new channels
to consumers. Online retailers such as Amazon (books and consumer goods),
ASOS (fashion) and Expedia (travel and hotel bookings) compete with store￾based retailers supplying directly from their websites. Apple created its own
online retail store, iTunes, to supply music downloads for its iPod, and its App
Store to distribute software applications to iPhone owners. Store-based
retailers have responded by developing their own sophisticated websites
selling a wide range of goods. Increasingly, these types of retailer are
developing a multichannel approach which means they can serve customer
needs in store, online and on the move via mobile communications. Marketing
in Action 16.2 describes how Costco shortens its distribution channel to keep
costs low.
Producer to wholesaler to retailer to consumer
For small retailers (e.g. convenience stores) with limited order quantities, the
use of wholesalers makes economic sense. Wholesalers can buy in bulk from
producers and sell smaller quantities to numerous retailers. The danger is large
retailers in the same market have the power to buy directly from producers and
thus cut out the wholesaler. In certain cases, the buying power of large retailers
has meant they can sell products to their customers more cheaply than a small
retailer can buy from the wholesaler.
Producer to agent to wholesaler to retailer to consumer
This long channel is sometimes used by firms entering foreign markets. They
may delegate the task of selling the product to an agent (who does not take title
to the goods). The agent contacts wholesalers (or retailers) and receives
commission on sales. Overseas sales of books are sometimes generated in this
way.page 647
Some firms use multiple channels to distribute their products. Grocery
products, for example, use both producer to wholesaler to retailer (small
grocers), and producer to retailer (supermarkets). The internet has
also encouraged the use of multiple channels (physical and
digital). For example, in the tourist industry, package holidays can be booked
through travel agencies or online, and hotels and flights can be booked over
the phone, on the internet or using an app. Such multichannel strategies allow
firms to differentiate their services to take advantage of the inherent strengths
of each channel (Wikström 2005). Multiple channels also provide wide market
coverage. For example, Sony achieves wide distribution coverage by using
multiple channels such as its own Sony Centres, electrical goods chain stores
such as Currys, catalogue shops such as Argos, and online retailers such as
Amazon.

Fingerprinting the Supply Chain Leads to Success for
Costco
Along with Walmart and Amazon, Costco is among the top five retailers in the world. It is the
largest US membership warehouse club and is rapidly expanding its global store portfolio.
The firm has 828 warehouses worldwide (mainly in North America), with others in regions
including the UK, where it has 29, Spain with four, two in France and one in Iceland, as well
as e-commerce operations. There are ambitious plans for more international expansion.
Costco’s sales are approaching $192 billion per year; the firm has 288,000 employees and
warehouses in important strategic locations around the world.page 648

The firm’s operational structure is organized to support the movement of goods, and
Costco’s global supply chain is important to its success. Costco spans the boundary
between business and consumer by operating a membership model that encourages both
business buyers and individual shoppers to use its warehouses. All buyers become
members of Costco, and this allows them to enjoy different levels of discounts. The prices
and benefits of membership programmes vary depending on the type of customer, their
spending patterns, and whether they are businesses or individuals.
The club membership fee, paid annually in advance, is another important factor in the firm’s
success. The level of loyalty among Costco’s members is very high, which supports its
global purchasing strategy. Costco is a low-cost operator and its spend on servicing the
supply chain, administration costs and costs associated with generating sales is lower than
that of other global retailers such as Walmart and Amazon. How Costco achieves this low￾cost position, even when its buyers are constantly looking for new products to tempt
customers, is by reducing the ‘fingerprints’ on its products. In other words, it reduces the
number of times a product is touched as it moves through the distribution chain, because
each touchpoint generates a handling cost that must be attributed to the product. The firm
also has a limited range of products (10,000 compared with around 40,000 in a large
Walmart supermarket). Following the traditional distribution model, goods would pass from
manufacturers to distributors, and then to retailers. Costco buys most of its products from
manufacturers, and this approach to distribution reduces the number of handling points
using cross-dock distribution depots, which is where manufactured goods are sorted,
gathered together and allocated to individual stores. The result is Costco can maximize the
efficiency of its distribution chain. Ultimately, this approach shortens the distribution channel
for both business and consumers.
This business model enables Costco to reward both employees and customers–employees
with wages that are higher than the industry average, and customers with lower prices and
cost savings. Customers who enjoy the cost savings often make impulse purchases of high￾ticket items like 3D televisions. Arguably, everyone benefits from this somewhat
counterintuitive retail strategy.

Business-to-business channels
Common business-to-business distribution channels are illustrated in Figure
16.3. Usually a maximum of one channel intermediary is used.
FIGURE 16.3
Distribution channels for business-to-business goodsProducer to business customer
Supplying business customers directly is common for expensive industrial
products such as gas turbines, diesel locomotives and aero engines. There
needs to be close liaison between supplier and customer to solve technical
problems, and the size of the order makes direct selling and distribution
economical.
Producer to agent to business customer
Instead of selling to business customers using its own sales force, a business￾to-business goods firm could employ the services of an agent, who may sell a
range of goods from several suppliers (on a commission basis), which spreads
selling costs and may be attractive to firms without the reserves to set up their
own sales operation. The disadvantage is there is little control over the agent,
who is unlikely to devote the same amount of time to selling on products as
would a dedicated sales team.
Producer to distributor to business customer
For less expensive, more frequently bought business-to-business products,
distributors are used. Internal staff deal with customer-generated enquiries and
order placing, order follow-up (often using the internet) and checking
inventory levels. For many routinely purchased goods, fully automated digitalpage 649
systems are used. Outside sales staff are more proactive: their practical
responsibilities are to find new customers, get products specified, distribute
catalogues and gather market information. The advantage to customers of
using distributors is they can buy small quantities locally.
Producer to agent to distributor to business customer
Where business customers prefer to call upon distributors, the agent’s job will
require selling into these intermediaries. The reason why a producer may
employ an agent rather than a dedicated sales force is usually cost based (as
previously discussed).
Services channels
Distribution channels for services are usually short–either direct or using an
agent. While, in many situations, stocks are not held, the role of the
wholesaler, retailer or industrial distributor is different in service supply
chains. For example, in the fast food industry and beauty industries,
products are purchased to use in the ‘production’ of service
deliverables such as a Big Mac burger or a manicure and painted nails. Figure
16.4 shows the two alternative channels, whether to consumers or business
customers. Service organizations look for innovative ways to reach customers,
as Marketing in Action 16.3 describes.

Online Order Delivery Solutions
The delivery side of online shopping presents many challenges for retailers as they aim to
create seamless shopping experiences for their customers when they buy online. As well as
traditional delivery services by post, an array of different collection solutions by courier have
been developed.
Source: Jeffrey Blackler/Alamy Stock Photo
Click and collect
This is a simple concept: customers buy online and then choose where they would like to
collect the goods, for example at petrol stations, local corner shops or Royal Mail post
offices. The concept has proved so popular for retailers like John Lewis it is predicted that,
soon, more than three-quarters of online purchases will be delivered through click-and￾collect schemes. eBay has even set up a collection scheme by partnering with Argos so its
sellers can offer this delivery option.
Remote click-and-collect locker
This delivery solution enables shoppers to pick up their goods from secure lockers. Amazon
first used this method so London commuters could pick up their orders at tube stations. The
service has since been extended to supermarkets, universities, fuel stations and many other
locations.
Temperature-controlled lockers
Grocery retailers such as Asda and Waitrose have developed collection lockers that are
sited in convenient locations for customers who do not want to visit the retailer’s store. The
locations of the lockers are carefully chosen to give consumers maximum convenience, for
example in car parks and near railway stations.
Timing and service levels
Additionally, there are multiple options for the timing and level of service of deliveries, for
example one-hour delivery, same day, next day, nominated day, weekend delivery. Eachpage 650
service has a different pricing structure. Amazon used delivery as part of its customer
acquisition strategy and introduced Amazon Prime, providing members who sign up for a
fee with an all-inclusive delivery service. It has more than 100 million members and
counting. The firm also introduced Amazon Prime Day, which has become one of the
biggest annual online shopping events in the world.
I want it now
Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s ice cream has set up a home delivery service, which is unusual for
an FMCG manufacturer. It works with fast-food brands such as Domino’s, Pizza Hut,
Germany’s Doner and others, and delivery services like Deliveroo and Uber Eats, to deliver
ice cream on demand.
Drones
Prime Air is Amazon’s drone delivery service, which has received significant investment
during the last 10 years. This method was tested with a small range of products (e.g.
sunscreen was successfully delivered to people at a conference in Palm Springs). At the
time of writing, the Prime Air service was due to go live in Lockeford, California, in 2022,
extending the range of products it is possible to deliver in this way. The research team has
worked on all aspects of using drones to extend the reach, operational efficiency, and safety
of obstacles, people, animals and aircraft. Domino’s is also exploring the use of drones for
pizza delivery in New Zealand, in partnership with SkyDrop. Walmart’s drone delivery
service is available to 4 million households in six US states.
Driverless cars
Domino’s, working with Nuro autonomous vehicles, has launched remote delivery using an
on-road robot.
In conclusion
Delivery innovations are changing the distribution and logistics industry, and automated or
remotely operated vehicles are set to revolutionize the industry.

Service provider to consumer or business customer
The close personal relationships between service providers and customers
often mean service supply is direct. Examples include healthcare, office
cleaning, accountancy, finance, marketing research and law. Global
accountancy firm KPMG is using digital technology to stay close to its
customers (see Exhibit 16.2).

Service provider to agent to consumer or business customer
A channel intermediary for a service firm usually takes the form of an agent.
Agents are used when the service provider is geographically distant from
customers and where it is not economical for the provider to establish its own
local sales team. Examples include insurance, travel, secretarial services and
theatrical agents.
Channel Strategy
Channel strategy decisions involve the selection of the most effective
distribution channels, the most appropriate level of distribution intensity and
the degree of channel integration (see Figure 16.5). Each of these decisions
will now be discussed.
FIGURE 16.5
Channel strategyChannel selection
Why does Procter & Gamble sell its brands through supermarkets rather than
selling direct? The answers are to be found by examining the following factors
that influence channel selection. These influences can be grouped under
market, producer, product and competitive factors.
Market factors
An important market factor is buyer behaviour: customer expectations may
dictate the product be sold in a certain way and channels need to meet
customer perceptions and needs. Failure to match customer expectations can
have negative consequences (Verhoef et al. 2007).
Buyer needs regarding product information, installation and technical
assistance also must be considered, and a judgement made about whether the
producer or channel intermediary can best meet these needs in terms of
expertise, commitment and cost. For example, products requiring facilities for
local servicing, such as cars, often use intermediaries to carry out the task.
Where the service requirement does not involve large capital investment, the
producer may carry out the service. For example, supplier of pest control,
Rentokil, trains its staff to conduct annual inspections and servicing as well as
fulfilling their sales roles. But the firm also works to raise awareness of wider
pest control issues, bringing added benefits to customers and society in
general. Working with Brunel University students on a ‘Green Week’ project,
Rentokil’s specialist teams started Pestaurants, where sweet chilli pigeon
burgers and savoury edible insects were supplied free of charge, and experts
were available to discuss which insects are edible and how to avoid pestproblems. Pestaurants started popping up in 2013 and have been an important
part of the firm’s fundraising efforts for malaria charities (Rentokil Initial plc
2018), with Rentokil inviting people from around the world to try alternative
foods in one of its Pestaurants (see Exhibit 16.3).

The willingness of channel intermediaries to market a product is also a
market-based factor influencing channel decisions. Direct distribution may be
the only option if distributors refuse to handle a product. For industrial
products, this may mean the recruitment of salespeople, while for consumer
products direct mail may be employed to communicate with and supply
customers. The profit margins demanded by wholesalers and retailers, and the
commission rates expected by sales agents also affect the attractiveness of
channel intermediaries. These costs need to be assessed in comparison with
those of a sales force.
The location and geographical concentration of customers also affects
channel selection. The more local and clustered the customer base, the more
likely it is direct distribution will be feasible. Direct distribution is also more
prevalent when buyers are few and buy large quantities. For products with
many small customers, using channel intermediaries may be the only
economical way of reaching them (hence supermarkets).
Producer factorspage 652
A constraint on the channel decision occurs when the producer lacks adequate
resources to perform the functions of the channel. Producers may lack the
financial and managerial resources to take on channel operations.
Lack of financial resources may mean a sales force cannot be
recruited, and sales agents and/or distributors are used instead. Producers may
feel they do not possess the customer-based skills to distribute their products
and prefer to rely on intermediaries.
The product mix offered by a producer may also affect channel strategy. A
wide mix of products may make direct distribution (and selling) cost-effective.
Narrow or single-product firms, on the other hand, may find the cost of direct
distribution prohibitive unless the product is extremely expensive.
The final product influence is the desired degree of control of channel
operations. The use of independent channel intermediaries reduces producer
control. For example, by distributing their products through supermarkets,
manufacturers lose total control of the price charged to consumers.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee new products will be stocked. Direct
distribution gives producers control over such issues.
Channel factors
Channel decision can be influenced by several factors: target customer and the
experience the supplier wishes to create; stage in the customer decision￾making process; and product type (Zhao and Deng 2020). Retailers are
integrating more channels into their distribution networks as online shopping is
on the increase. But this creates operational and logistical challenges,
especially for grocery retailers (Ellis-Chadwick 2011). A typical online grocery
order consists of 60–80 items across three temperature regimes, picking from a
total range of 10,000–25,000 products within 12–24 hours for delivery to
customers within one- to two-hour time slots. Supermarket retailers have made
significant investments in technology to manage the complexities associated
with receiving products from thousands of suppliers, then picking and
delivering millions of consumer orders. Online-only grocery retailer Ocado
makes extensive use of digital technology to enable its business to operate. To
manage its complex online operations, it has developed in-house software and
uses state-of-the-art gaming software to visualize and identify problems, with
the aim of streamlining operations in its automated warehouse and national
supply chain (Ocado 2018). Ocado’s IT team is pushing the boundaries inevery aspect of the business by developing online and mobile apps for all the
latest platforms (e.g. Android and iPad).
Digital channels have increased the number of touchpoints where a
customer can engage with a business (see Chapter 5 for details). The desire to
provide seamless customer service across all these touchpoints is at the heart
of the multichannel distribution system, so whether it is the point of purchase,
payment system, a customer service encounter, delivery or reverse logistics
(returning/recycling goods)–in fact, wherever a customer touches the brand–
the experience (i.e. the product offer, customer service and marketing message)
should be the same (Sharma and Parida 2018).
Offering seamless and streamlined retail services, and managing logistics
in multichannel relationships is increasingly done using technology, which has
transformed supply chains across the retail industry by using digital
technology to respond to the evolving needs of consumers (Grewal et al.
2017). The movement of goods and the flow of information between retailers
and their suppliers are critical to operational success, and whereas retailers
used to be ‘passive recipients of products, allocated to stores by manufacturers
in anticipation of demand’, now they are in control and manage supplies in
response to customer demand (Fernie et al. 2010). ASOS sells more than
20,000 branded and own-label products through its online e-commerce
operation. Digital systems and barcode technologies are enabling it to offer ‘a
much wider product range than its high-street competitors’. Lean and agile
supply chains that support large retail operations manage the purchasing,
processing and movement of vast quantities of products, so individual items
are in the right place at the right time to satisfy customer needs.
Multichannel and omnichannel retailing
The strategic development of multichannel and omnichannel operations is
important as channel switching (by consumers) becomes more prevalent,
especially with the use of mobile channels for ordering on the increase.
Multichannel retailers operate more than one channel, and each channel may
have independent operations and logistics.
Rigby introduced the term omnichannel retailing, envisioning shopping
journeys, which began with a videoconference with a personal style advisor,
then viewing chosen items on a personal avatar, reading customer reviews and
finally visiting the retailer’s e-commerce site. Having selected goods and
placed an order, items are then collected from a local store or delivered to thepage 653
customer’s home (Rigby 2011). Omnichannel retailing is defined as the
optimization of multiple sales channels to create seamless and
connected customer experiences. The difference between
multichannel and omnichannel retailing is that, in the latter, every stage of the
customer shopping journey is linked to create an information-rich shopping
experience, enabling customers to connect via social media, mobile apps and
more (de Borba et al. 2020). Reinartz and colleagues (2019) suggest the
increasing sophistication of e-commerce solutions, mobile shopping, smart
technologies (see Exhibit 16.4) and the rise of new online-only competitors is
eroding the value of traditional store-only retailing. They suggest five sources
of value creation, which create opportunities to create customer value (see
Figure 16.6).

Product factors
Large, complex products are often supplied directly to customers. The need for
close personal contact between producer and customer, and the high prices
charged, means direct distribution and selling are both necessary and feasible.
Perishable products such as frozen food, meat and bread require relatively
short channels to supply the customer with fresh stock. Bulky products, or
those that are difficult to handle, may require direct distribution, because
distributors may refuse to carry them if storage or display problems arise
(Rosenbloom 1987). The increase in online shopping has encouraged
retailers to explore increasingly innovative ways to get goods to their
customers and add collection points to the end of the distribution chain. See
Marketing in Action 16.3 to find out more.
Competitive factorsIf the competition controls traditional channels of distribution–for example,
through franchise or exclusive dealing arrangements–an innovative approach
to distribution may be required. Two alternatives are to recruit a sales force to
sell direct or to set up a producer-owned distribution network (see the section
on vertical marketing systems, under ‘Conventional marketing channels’,
below). Producers should not accept that the channels of distribution used by
competitors are the only ways to reach target customers. Direct marketing
provides opportunities to supply products in new ways. Traditional channels of
distribution for personal computers through high-street retailers, for example,
are being circumvented by direct marketers, who use direct-response
advertising to reach buyers. The emergence of the more computer-aware and
experienced buyer, and the higher reliability of these products as the market
reaches maturity, have meant a local source of supply (and advice) is less
important. Digitization of product not only changes the mode but also changes
timings, access and availability.
Technology factors
Widespread use of digital channels and the growth of online sales (especially
during the Covid-19 pandemic) have encouraged greater use of e-commerce
solutions, and many manufacturers have adopted web-based and mobile
solutions as new channels to market, two major benefits being lower
distribution costs and access to new markets (Palmatier et al. 2016). But digital
channels can create problems relating to territories and lead to less control over
access to customers. This friction can mean intensified competition between
distributors and wholesalers using digital channels (Lee et al. 2003;
Cunningham 2013). Technology has also improved transparency: every
transaction can be monitored, bringing greater transparency to channel
relationships. Retailers are using technology creatively to deliver additional
benefits; Majestic Wine and Ted Baker are two examples of firms that have
invested in developing highly responsive stock management systems, and can
move goods from (container) ship to store, speeding up and streamlining the
journey to the end customer. Sainsbury’s and Waitrose are picking in-store to
serve e-commerce orders. The Very Group has automated its warehousing,
with robots managing the dispatch and return of products, enabling the
dispatch of an order in less than 20 minutes (Dunsby et al. 2022).
Distribution intensitypage 655
The second channel strategy decision is the choice of distribution intensity,
which can be defined as level of availability given to particular products by the
manufacturer. The three broad options are intensive, selective and exclusive
distribution.
Intensive distribution
Intensive distribution aims to achieve saturation coverage of the market by
using all available outlets. With many mass-market products, such as soft
drinks, foods, toiletries, alcohol and newspapers, sales are a direct function of
the number of outlets penetrated. This is because consumers have a range of
acceptable brands from which they can choose. If a brand is not available in an
outlet, an alternative is bought. The convenience aspect of purchase is
paramount. New outlets may be sought that hitherto had not stocked the
products, such as petrol stations to sell confectionery and grocery items. In the
UK, this trend has also encouraged supermarkets to locate convenience stores
with a wide range of products at motorway service stations, for example Marks
& Spencer’s Simply Food stores in Moto service stations and Waitrose as the
food brand on offer in Welcome Break service stations (Motorway Services
Online 2015).
Selective distribution
Market coverage may also be achieved through selective distribution, in
which a producer uses a limited number of outlets in a geographical area to sell
its products. The advantages to the producer are the opportunity to select only
the best outlets on which to focus its efforts to build close working
relationships, to train distributor staff in fewer outlets than with
intensive distribution, and, if selling and distribution are direct, to
reduce costs. Luxury aspirational brands are often sold in carefully selected
outlets. Retail outlets and industrial distributors like this type of arrangement
since it reduces competition. Selective distribution is more likely to be used
when buyers are willing to shop around when choosing products. This means it
is not necessary for a firm to have its products available in all outlets–for
example, Jaguar Land Rover (vehicles), Louis Vuitton and Chanel (luxury
apparel), Moët Hennessy (fine champagne and cognac)–and brands can restrict
where their products can be sold.Within the EU, the European Commission is keen to maximize cross￾border trade to achieve the single-market objectives of freely flowing goods
around member countries. Competition laws on selective distribution state
firms should avoid agreements that might restrict trade. The approach has
implications for luxury brands as they should not enter into selective
agreements that contravene the law. Pierre Cardin became caught up in an
investigation suggesting the luxury brand was restricting the ability of its
licensees to sell its products cross-border. This case raises issues of grey
markets and parallel imports (Maxwell and Barker 2022).
Grey markets occur when a product is sold through an unauthorized
distribution channel. When this occurs in international marketing, the practice
is called parallel importing. Usually, a distributor buys goods in one country
(where prices are low) and sells them in another (where prices are high) at
below the going market price. This causes anger among members of the
authorized distribution channel, who see their prices being undercut.
Furthermore, the products may well be sold in mass-market outlets that
discredit the image of the product, or be sold cheaply online. Quality fashion
brands such as Burberry, Armani and Abercrombie & Fitch have experienced
the ‘grey market effect’ on their brands. Nevertheless, supporters of grey
markets argue they encourage price competition, increase consumer choice and
promote the lowering of price differentials between countries.
Exclusive distribution
Exclusive distribution is an extreme form of selective distribution in which
only one wholesaler, retailer or industrial distributor is used in a geographic
area and is given rights to exclusive territory. Cars are often sold on this basis,
with only one dealer operating in each town or city. This reduces a purchaser’s
power to negotiate prices for the same model between dealers, since to buy in
a neighbouring town may be inconvenient when servicing or repairs are
required. It also allows very close cooperation between producer and retailer
over servicing, pricing and promotion. Initially, Apple’s iPhone was subject to
exclusive distribution in the UK through mobile phone operator O2
 and retailer
Carphone Warehouse (Ritson 2008), but this was soon extended to include
other retailers. The right to exclusive distribution may be demanded by
distributors as a condition for stocking a manufacturer’s product line. Many
luxury brands use this approach. Similarly, producers may wish for exclusive
dealing, which is where the distributor agrees not to stock competing lines.page 656
Adidas even refused to supply Sports Direct with replica football shirts
because of the retailer’s ‘pile ’em high, sell ’em cheap’ approach to
merchandising (Joseph 2013). The selection of an exclusive set of distributors
can provide the basis for excellent customer service. For example, Caterpillar,
the tractor manufacturer, is renowned for the quality of its exclusive dealer
network. Dealers undergo rigorous selection procedures, but once accepted are
treated very well to make them feel part of the Caterpillar family. This is
because Caterpillar recognizes the importance of dealer service in backing up
its reputation for highly reliable machines (Caterpillar 2022).
Slotting allowances, exclusive dealing and restrictions to supply
Food is big business, and most products find the way to supermarket shelves
and the retail grocery business tends to be dominated by mega-brands, for
example Walmart, Carrefour and Tesco. The power shift from manufacturers to
retailers in this industry has meant slotting allowances are often demanded by
large retailers. A slotting allowance is a fee paid in exchange for an agreement
to place a product in a preferential space on the retailer’s shelves. Retailers say
they are simply charging rent for a valuable, scarce commodity: shelf space
(Stanton and Herbst 2006). Tesco got into a row over slotting allowances, and
the dispute was blamed for destabilizing the power it exerted over suppliers
(Meville 2014). Critics argue these charges represent an abuse of power and
work against small manufacturers who cannot afford to pay the fee. Research
in the grocery sector found nearly 40 per cent of manufacturers complained of
being asked to pay fees for a retailer to stock their produce (Butler 2015).
Another concern of small suppliers is that the power of large manufacturers
and retailers will mean they are squeezed out of the supply chain. In the UK,
farmers and small grocery suppliers have joined forces to demand better
treatment from large supermarket chains, which are forging exclusive deals
with major manufacturers. They claim the problem is made worse
by the growth of category management, where retailers appoint
‘category captains’ from their suppliers, who act to improve the standing of the
whole product category, such as breakfast cereals or confectionery. The small
suppliers believe this forces them out of the category altogether, as category
captains look after their own interests.
Channel integrationChannel integration can range from conventional marketing channels
comprising an independent producer and channel intermediaries, through a
franchise operation, to channel ownership by a producer. Producers need to
consider the strengths and weaknesses of each system when setting channel
strategies.
Conventional marketing channels
The independence of channel intermediaries means the producer has little or
no control over them. Arrangements such as exclusive dealing may provide a
degree of control, but separation of ownership means each party will look after
its own interests. Conventional marketing channels are characterized by hard
bargaining and, occasionally, conflict. For example, a retailer may believe
cutting the price of a brand is necessary to move stock, even though the
producer objects because of brand image considerations.
However, separation of ownership means each party can specialize in the
function in which it has strengths: manufacturers produce, intermediaries
distribute. Care needs to be taken by manufacturers to stay in touch with
customers and not abdicate this responsibility to retailers.
A manufacturer that dominates a market through its size and strong brands
may exercise considerable power over intermediaries, even though they are
independent. This power may result in an administered vertical marketing
system where the manufacturer can command considerable cooperation from
wholesalers and retailers. Major brand builders such as Procter & Gamble and
Unilever traditionally held great leverage over distribution but, more recently,
power has moved towards the large dominant supermarket chains through their
purchasing and market power. Marks & Spencer is a clear example of a retailer
controlling an administered vertical marketing system. Through its dominant
market position, it is capable of exerting considerable authority over its
suppliers.
Franchising
A franchise is a legal contract in which a producer and channel intermediaries
agree each member’s rights and obligations. Usually, the intermediary receives
marketing, managerial, technical and financial services in return for a fee.
Franchise organizations such as McDonald’s, Benetton, Hertz, The Body Shop
and Anytime Fitness combine the strengths of sophisticated marketing-page 657
orientated organization with the energy and motivation of a locally owned
outlet. Franchising is also commonplace in the car industry, where dealers
agree exclusive deals with manufacturers in return for marketing and financial
backing. Although a franchise operation gives a degree of producer control,
there are still areas of potential conflict. For example, the producer may be
dissatisfied with the standard of service provided by the outlet, or the
franchisee may believe the franchising organization provides inadequate
promotional support. Goal conflict can also arise. Also, compared with
ownership, the franchise organization lacks total control over franchisees.
A franchise agreement provides a contractual vertical marketing system
through the formal coordination and integration of marketing and distribution
activities. Some franchise organizations exert a considerable degree of control
over financial and marketing operations. For example, to become a KFC
franchisee, there is a licence fee of $45,000, a monthly royalty of 6 per cent, a
5 per cent contribution to advertising, plus the cost of buying and fitting out
the restaurant, which can be more than $250,000. Additional funding is
required for purchasing stock, paying for training, wages, utility bills and
insurance premiums (KFC 2022).
Despite the cost of setting up and running a franchise, there are compelling
reasons why a producer might choose franchising as a means of distribution.
Franchising allows the producer to overcome internal resource constraints by
providing access to the franchisee’s resources, as can be seen in the KFC
example. The franchisee not only pays a set-up fee but also makes an ongoing
contribution through regular royalty payments. Using this method, firms can
gain access to geographically dispersed areas. KFC dominates the fast-food
franchise market in China, beating McDonald’s to highly sought-after
locations in major Chinese cities. Read Marketing in Action 16.4 to find out
more about franchising through Yum! and its successful franchise operations.
MARKETING IN ACTION 16.4
Alone We’re Delicious, Together We’re Yum!Yum! Brands, Inc. (www.yum.com) is based in Louisville, Kentucky, in the US, and has four
highly successful brands in its portfolio: KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and The Habit Burger
Grill, which makes it one of the world’s largest restaurant firms, with more than 53,422
outlets in over 125 countries. China is a growing market for Yum!, where it now operates
8,400 KFC fast-food restaurants in 1,700 cities, 2,600 Pizza Hut restaurants in 600 cities
and 42 Taco Bell units, with KFC currently the most profitable. Also in this market, Little
Sheep is a Mongolian hot-pot restaurant franchise, with 200 units, and Huang Ji Huang a
casual Chinese-style dining restaurant with 600 units.

Initially, Yum! took care to recruit managers who understood the local area, and was also
careful to select the right joint venture partners: Beijing Corporation of Animal Production,
Processing, Industry and Commerce, and Beijing Travel and Tourism Corporation. The
reasons for not using the franchise model to expand in the early days were because of
stringent Chinese rules and legislation. Changing economic conditions, however, favour
franchising, and there is plenty of demand from the country’s 600-million-strong middle￾class.
Yum! aims to expand its number of outlets in this area to 20,000. The franchise approach
has enabled the firm to become the most successful foreign firm operating in China. The
business has been so successful because it has used local foods and management teams
to build partnerships and drive expansion. If you visit a KFC in China, you not only can buy
a bucket of fried chicken, but you also can have a bowl of rice porridge with pork, pickles,
mushrooms and preserved egg.
Yum! has also moved into Africa with its highly successful franchise approach. There is a
Pizza Hut in Johannesburg, South Africa.
During Covid-19–amid lockdowns, social distancing and other local restrictions–Yum! added
4,200 new restaurants to its portfolio, mainly in China. However, the conflict between Russia
and Ukraine led to Yum! making a strategic withdrawal from Russia, selling its KFC and
Pizza Hut franchises.

Regarding franchises, producers may value the notion of the owner￾manager who has a vested interest in the success of the business. Although
some control may still be necessary, the franchisee benefits directly from
increases in sales and profits, and so has a financial incentive to manage the
business well. Finally, franchising may be a way for a producer to access the
local knowledge of the franchisee; franchising may therefore be attractive
when a producer is expanding into new markets and where potential
franchisees have access to information that is important in penetrating such
markets.
The three most common levels where franchising is used in the distribution
chain are:
1. Manufacturer and retailer: the car industry is dominated by this
arrangement. The manufacturer gains retail outlets for its cars and repair
facilities without the capital outlay required by ownership.
2. Manufacturer and wholesaler: this is commonly used in the soft drinks
industry. Manufacturers such as Schweppes, Coca-Cola and Pepsi grant
wholesalers the right to make up and bottle their concentrate in line with
their instructions, and to distribute the products within a defined
geographical area.
3. Retailer and retailer: a frequently used method that often has its roots in a
successful retailing operation seeking to expand geographically by means of
a franchise operation, often with great success. Examples include
McDonald’s, Benetton, Pizza Hut and KFC.
See Table 16.1 for examples of some of the world’s top franchises.
TABLE 16.1 Examples of top franchises in terms of number of units worldwideSource: Franchise Worldwide (2022); www.franchisedirect.co.uk/top500
Channel ownership
Total control over distributor activities comes with channel ownership. This
establishes a corporate vertical marketing system. By purchasing retail
outlets, producers control their purchasing, production and marketing
activities. Control over purchasing means a captive outlet for the
manufacturer’s products. For example, channel ownership is common in the
clothing industry, with firms such as Inditex (Zara) and H&M owning their
own chains of retail outlets.
The advantages of control must be weighed against the high price of
acquisition and the danger the move into retailing will spread managerial
activities too widely.
Channel Management
Once the key channel strategy decisions have been made, effective
implementation is required. Specifically, several channel management issues
must be addressed (see Figure 16.7). These are the selection of suppliers and
channel members, motivation, training and evaluation, and managing conflict
between channel members.
FIGURE 16.7page 659
Channel management
Selection
For some producers, the distribution problem is not so much channel selection
as channel acceptance. The selection decision can vary depending on the size
of the producer; for example, very small firms face difficulties when trying to
persuade large retailers to stock their products (see the example of Kick Start
earlier in the chapter for how Lidl is helping to overcome this with some
producers). Selection, then, involves identifying candidates and developing
selection criteria:
Identifying sources–sources that can help identify candidates for selection
include trade sources, reseller enquiries, customers of distributors and the
field sales force. Trade sources include trade associations, exhibitions and
trade publications. Talking to trade associations can lead to the supply of
names of prospective distributors. Exhibitions provide a useful means of
meeting and talking to possible suppliers and distributors. Channel members
can contact a producer to express an interest in handling its products.
Customers of distributors are a useful source of information, since they can
comment on distributors’ merits and limitations. Finally, if a producer
already has a field sales force calling on intermediaries, salespeople are in a
good position to seek out possible new distributors in their own territory.
Developing selection criteria–selection criteria include market, product and
customer knowledge, market coverage, quality and size of the sales force (if
applicable), reputation among customers, financial standing, the extent towhich competitive and complementary products are carried, managerial
competence, and the degree of enthusiasm for handling the producer’s lines.
In practice, selection may be complex because large, well-established
distributors may carry many competing lines, whereas smaller distributors
may be more enthusiastic and hungrier for success, and therefore eager to
meet selection criteria. Criteria for selection of overseas distributors include
market and customer knowledge, enthusiasm and hunger for success, and
the fact the distributor does not carry competitors’ products.
Motivation
Once selected, channel members need to be motivated to agree to act as a
distributor, and allocate adequate commitment and resources to the producer’s
lines. The key to effective motivation is to understand the needs and problems
of distributors. For example, a distributor that values financial incentives may
respond more readily to high commission rates than one more concerned with
having an exclusive territory. Possible motivators include financial rewards,
territorial exclusivity, provision of resource support (e.g. sales training,
provision of marketing research information, advertising and promotion
support), and the development of strong work relationships (e.g. joint
planning, assurance of long-term commitment, appreciation of effort and
success, frequent exchange of views and arranging distributor conferences).
Producers should seek to develop strong long-term relationships with their
distributors, based on recognition of their performance, and integrated
planning and operations. Jointly determined sales targets can motivate
salespeople, who might receive a bonus on achievement. Targets are also
useful for monitoring performance.
Training
Training for channel members depends on their requirement and training
needs. Large supermarket chains tend to have in-house training and many need
only limited specialist input from a manufacturer. However, smaller
distributors may benefit from training packages, which enhance performance.
From the producer’s perspective, training can provide the necessary technical
knowledge about a supplier firm and its products, and help to build a spirit of
partnership and commitment. When training is provided, it usually takes the
form of product and firm knowledge, relationship management, servicepage 660
standards and a range of other key knowledge points. Sharing this knowledge
can help to build strong personal relationships and give distributors the
confidence to sell those products.
Evaluation
Evaluation of channel members has an important bearing on distributor
retention, training and motivation decisions. Evaluation provides the
information necessary to decide which channel members to retain and which to
drop. Shortfalls in distributor skills and competences may be identified
through evaluation, and appropriate training programmes organized
by producers. Where a lack of motivation is recognized as a problem,
producers can implement plans designed to deal with the root causes of
demotivation (e.g. financial incentives and/or fostering a partnership approach
to business).
Managing conflict
Conflict, in this context, has been defined as ‘the tension between two or more
social entities (large organizations, individuals or groups)’ (Sharma and Parida
2018) when they have different expectations, for example of financial,
behavioural and/or social outcomes. The intensity of conflict can range from
occasional minor disagreements that are quickly forgotten to major disputes
that fuel continuous bitter relationships. UK broadcaster Channel 4, for
example, lost £20 million a month in revenue, caused by the absence of
advertising on the TV channel by major brands such as EE, Barclays, Kuoni
and BSkyB, when it entered into a conflict with media investment company
GroupM over the cost of advertising (O’Reilly 2013).
It is important to be aware of various sources of conflict.
Sources of channel conflict
Sources of channel conflict are differences in goals, multiple distribution
channels, and inadequacies in performance.
Differences in goals: Most resellers attempt to maximize their own profit.
This can be accomplished by improving profit margins, reducing inventory
levels, increasing sales, lowering expenses and receiving greater allowancesfrom suppliers. In contrast, producers might benefit from lower margins,
greater channel inventories, higher promotional expenses and fewer
allowances given to channel members. These inherent conflicts of interest
mean there are many potential areas of disagreement between producers and
their channel members.
Multiple distribution channels: In trying to achieve market coverage, a
producer may use multiple distribution channels. For example, a producer
may decide to sell directly to key accounts, because their size warrants a key
account sales force, and use channel intermediaries to give wide market
coverage. Conflict can arise when a channel member is denied access to a
lucrative order from a key account because it is being serviced directly by
the producer. Disagreements can also occur when the producer owns retail
outlets that compete with independent retailers that also sell the producer’s
brands.
Inadequacies in performance: This is when parties in the supply chain do
not perform to expectations. For example, a channel member may
underperform in terms of sales, level of inventory carried, customer service,
standards of display, and salesperson effectiveness. Producers may give poor
delivery, inadequate promotional support, low profit margins, poor-quality
goods and incomplete shipments. Retailer Monsoon Accessorize is
potentially intensifying the number of opportunities for areas of conflict. Its
CEO Paul Allen says of a new delivery service, ‘Ship from store is a
transformational project for our business, an important milestone on the
road to becoming a fully integrated omnichannel retailer’ (Rigby 2018). To
ensure success, the retailer needs to have ways to resolve potential areas of
conflict, deal with channel members across the supply chain and the end
consumer when seeking to fulfil strategic aims based on channel
performance. Sharma and Parida (2018) suggest conflict is almost inevitable
in marketing channels and is largely due to interdependencies between
channel members, which are mediated by the balance of power, levels of
trust, and extent of loyalty and commitment–which, if positive, can
moderate causes of conflict but, if negative, can intensify them. Marketing
managers constantly try to avoid or resolve conflict.
Avoiding and resolving conflict
How can producers and channel members avoid and resolve conflict? There
are several ways to manage conflict:page 661
Developing a partnership approach: This calls for frequent interaction
between producer and resellers to develop a spirit of mutual understanding
and cooperation. Producers can help channel members with training,
financial help and promotional support. Distributors, in turn, may settle
mutually agreed sales targets and provide extra sales resources. The
objective is to build confidence in the manufacturer’s products and
relationships, based on trust. When conflicts arise, there is more chance they
will be resolved in a spirit of cooperation. Organizing staff exchange
programmes can be useful in allowing each party to understand the
problems and tensions of the other, to avoid giving rise to animosity.
Training in conflict handling: Staff who handle disputes need to be trained
in negotiation and communication skills. They need to be able to handle
high-pressure conflict situations without resorting to emotion and blaming
behaviour. Instead, they should be able to handle such situations calmly and
be able to handle concession analysis–the identification of win/win
situations. These are situations where both the producer and
reseller benefit from an agreement.
Market partitioning: To reduce or eliminate conflict from multiple
distribution channels, producers can try to partition markets on some logical
basis, such as customer size or type. This can work if channel members
accept the basis for the partitioning. Alternatively, different channels can be
supplied with different product lines.
Improving performance: Many conflicts occur for genuine reasons. For
example, poor delivery by manufacturers or inadequate sales effort by
distributors can provoke frustration and anger. Rather than attempt to
placate the aggrieved partner, the most effective solution is to improve
performance so the source of conflict disappears. This is the most effective
way of dealing with such problems.
Channel ownership: An effective but expensive way of resolving conflicting
goals is to buy the other party. Since producer and channel member are
under common ownership, the common objective is to maximize joint
profits. Conflicts can still occur, but the dominant partner is able to resolve
them quickly. Some producers in Europe have integrated with channel
intermediaries successfully.
Coercion: In some situations, conflict resolution may be dependent on
coercion, where one party induces compliance using force. For example,
producers can threaten to withdraw supply, deliver late or withdraw
financial support; channel members, on the other hand, can threaten to delistthe manufacturer’s products, promote competitive products and develop
own-label brands.
Retailing: Physical and Digital
Channels to Market
Up until now in this chapter, we have explored channel strategy, focusing on
the key areas of channel management decisions. In this section, we examine
multichannel distribution decisions and the implications for channel
management in a retail context.
Physical distribution
Physical distribution is defined as a set of activities concerned with the
physical flows of materials, components and finished goods from producer to
channel intermediaries and consumers. The combination of channels used by
retailers is becoming increasingly diverse as they try to provide customers with
non-stop access to goods and services. For retailers, the aim is to provide
customers with the right products, in the right quantities, in the right locations,
at the right time. Physical distribution activities have been the subject of
managerial attention for some time, because of the potential for cost savings
and improving customer service levels. Cost savings can be achieved by
reducing inventory levels, using cheaper forms of transport and shipping in
bulk rather than small quantities. Customer service levels can be improved by:
fast and reliable delivery, including just-in-time delivery; holding high
inventory levels, so customers have a wide choice and the chances of stockouts
are reduced; fast order processing; and ensuring products arrive in the right
quantities and quality. Now channel selection has become a means of adding
customer value.
In the clothing industry, fast-changing fashion demands mean firms such as
Shein, H&M and Zara use extremely short lead times to create a competitive
advantage over their slower, more cumbersome, rivals. Inditex (Zara) uses a
vertically integrated supply chain. Read Mini Case 16.1 to find out more.page 662
MINI CASE 16.1
Managing the Supply Chain the Zara Way: Direct From
Factory Floor to Shop Window
Zara, the Spanish clothing firm owned by Inditex, has revolutionized the fashion industry by
becoming the first global retailer to sell fashion lines designed especially for seasons in the
southern as well as the northern hemisphere. Zara has a successful business model that
has enabled the retail chain to expand to more than 3,000 outlets and stores in Europe,
South America, Oceania and Africa, which means developing ranges to suit the seasons is
an important part of its expansion strategy. Its key competitive advantage lies in its ability to
match fashion trends that change quickly. This, in turn, relies on an extremely fast and
responsive supply chain. While other retailers moved production to the Far
East to save money, Zara’s marketing team knew it could make its bestselling
clothes faster in Spain.

Zara uses its stores to discover consumer wants, which styles are selling, what colours are
in demand, and which items are hot sellers and which failures. The data are fed back to
Zara headquarters through a sophisticated marketing information system. At the end of
each day, Zara sales assistants report to the store manager using wireless headsets to
communicate inventory levels. The store managers then inform the Zara design and
distribution departments at HQ about what consumers are buying, asking for and avoiding.
Top-selling items are requested and low-selling items are withdrawn from shops within a
week. There is a big incentive for store managers to get this right, as up to 70 per cent of
their salary is based on commission.
Garments are made in small production runs to avoid overexposure, and no item stays in
the shops for more than four weeks, which encourages Zara shoppers to make repeat
visits. Whereas the average high-street store in Spain expects shoppers to visit on average
three times a year, Zara shoppers visit up to 17 times.
The firm’s designers use the feedback from stores when preparing new designs. The fabrics
are cut and dyed at Zara’s own highly automated manufacturing facilities, which gives it
control over this part of the supply chain. Seamstresses in 350 independently owned
workshops in Spain and Portugal stitch about half of the pre-cut pieces into garments; thepage 663
other half are stitched in-house. Only basic items such as T-shirts are bought from low-cost
regions such as eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. Although wages are higher in Spain, Zara
saves time and money on shipping.
The finished garments are sent back to Zara’s headquarters, with its state-of-the-art
logistics centre, where they are electronically tagged, quality checked and sorted into
distribution lots for shipping to their destinations. Although Zara supplies every market from
warehouses in Spain, it manages to get new merchandise to European stores within 24
hours and, by flying goods via commercial airlines, to stores in the Americas and Asia in 48
hours or less.
So efficient are Zara’s production and distribution systems the average turnaround time
from design to delivery is 10–15 days, with around 12,000 garment styles being marketed
each year. In this way, Zara stays on top of fashion trends rather than being outpaced by
the market. And, by producing smaller batches of clothing, it adds an air of exclusivity that
encourages customers to shop often. As a result, the chain does not have to slash prices by
50 per cent, as rivals often do, to move mass quantities of out-of-season stock. Since Zara
is more in tune with current looks, it can also charge slightly more than, for example, Gap,
which it has now overtaken to become the world’s largest clothing retailer.
Questions:
1. Discuss the implications of shorter product lifecycles for a clothing manufacturer like
Zara or H&M (also see Marketing in Action 16.1 on Shein).
2. Suggest why Zara does not just use the garment ranges developed in the winter for
the northern hemisphere and then sell them on in the southern hemisphere.
3. At the opposite end of the spectrum from fast fashion is the ‘slow fashion’ movement,
which advocates buying fewer clothes of better quality that will last longer and help to
save the environment. Do you think this growing trend will affect the demand for fast
fashion, and do fast-fashion brands appeal only to the young?
Based on: Economist (2002); Roux (2002); BBC (2003); Mitchell (2003); Capell (2008);
Johnson and Falstead (2011); Fahy and Jobber (2015)
Physical distribution management concerns balancing costs, logistics and
meeting customer service expectations. Trade-offs are often necessary. For
example, low inventory and slow, cheaper transportation methods reduce costs
but offer lower customer service levels and satisfaction. Determining this
balance is a key marketing decision, as physical distribution is a source of
competitive advantage. A useful approach is to analyse the market in terms of
customer service needs and price sensitivity. The result may be the discovery
of two segments:1. low service needs, high price sensitivity
2. high service needs, low price sensitivity.
Unipart was first to exploit segment 2 in the do-it-yourself car repair and
servicing market. It gave excellent customer service but charged a high price.
Unipart’s analysis, therefore, defined the market segment to target and the
appropriate marketing mix.
Alternatively, segments could be targeted with different marketing mixes.
In business-to-business markets, large firms may possess their own service
facilities, while smaller firms require producer or distributor service as part of
the product offering and are willing to pay a higher price.
Not only are there trade-offs between physical distribution costs and
customer service levels, but there are also possible conflicts between elements
of the physical distribution system itself. For example, an inventory manager
may favour low stocks to reduce costs, but if this leads to stockouts this may
raise costs elsewhere–the freight manager may have to accept higher costs
resulting from fast freight deliveries to guarantee the safety of the products. A
key role the physical distribution manager would perform would be to
reconcile the conflicts inherent in the system, so total costs are minimized
subject to required customer service levels.
Virtual distribution and the impact of e-commerce
E-commerce systems facilitate transactions, the flow of products, cash and
information, and reverse product logistics (returns), and can be used to meet
customers’ demands in terms of timing, location and speed of delivery. But
these demands place additional pressures on channel partners. The bringing
together of physical and digital channels to achieve shared goals raises extra
challenges for all channel members. Marketing managers need to plan and
prepare guidelines and training to avoid conflict. Those involved must also
ensure all efforts are pointing in the same direction. However, there is an
additional layer of complexity, as e-commerce systems can be both
marketplace and sales and inventory management systems. Trust plays an
important role and can either be confirmed or lost based on the performance of
these integrated channels (Sharma and Parida 2018).page 664
Retailing
Traditionally, retailing was considered a rather passive activity, with goods
passing from manufacturer to wholesaler then to retailer and, finally, to
individual customers. Then retailers discovered the importance of
understanding and satisfying customer needs, and this represented an
important landmark in the development and definition of modern connected
retailing (Ellis-Chadwick 2011). The implication of this shift towards a
customer-centric operation is at the heart of many of the channel management
decisions we have discussed so far in this chapter. In the remaining part of the
chapter, we consider retail marketing decisions and the retail mix, and online
and mobile retailing.
Retail marketing decisions
As with any modern business, retailers must understand the environment in
which they trade, and anticipate and adapt to changing environmental
circumstances. We shall now explore some of the key retailing decisions
necessary to prosper in today’s competitive climate. These decisions involve
retail positioning, store location, product assortment and services, price and
store atmosphere, and have to be taken against a background of rapid changes
in information technology. Retailers are no strangers to information technology
developments, with electronic point of sale (EPOS) systems allowing the
counting of products sold and money taken, and faster service at checkouts.
Barcodes, universal product codes (UPCs; used for tracking items in stores and
across the supply chain), scanners and associated technology have
revolutionized retail supply chains, stock management and retail operations.
Online shopping has pushed innovation further, with electronic payments,
shopping via mobile phone, augmented-reality displays, and more.
Retail positioning
As with all marketing decisions, retail positioning involves the choice of
target market and differential advantage. Targeting allows retailers to tailor
their marketing mix–which includes product assortment, service levels, store
location, prices and promotion–to the needs of their chosen customer
segment. Differentiation provides a reason to shop at one store ratherthan another. For some retailers (e.g. Aldi, Costco, Amazon), the low-cost
strategic option remains viable, while others (e.g. Waitrose, John Lewis
Partnership, Harrods) take the high-quality differentiated route. Many retailers,
however, find themselves stuck in the middle, falling between low cost and
high quality (Berman 2010). Often this occurs when retailers attempt to be all
things to all people. The outcome can be that the retailer needs to respond
rapidly if it is to survive. For example, in 2015, leading UK supermarket
retailer Tesco was facing falling profits and market share, and in response cut
its prices to compete with limited-range discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Many of the changes occurring in retail are as a result of the effect of the
internet on traditional models. Retailers are left facing challenging decisions
about which market positions to inhabit, which locations to utilize, how to
communicate with their customers, and the extent to which their products can
be augmented by additional services. Consequently, the way in which retailers
are using the marketing mix to differentiate their brands has changed (Verhoef
et al. 2015).
The rest of this section explores how retailers seek to differentiate their
offer.
Place: in-store location
Multichannel and omnichannel retailing occurs when retailers add new
channels to their existing offer, and integrate these into connected networks.
For example, traditional store-based retailers (e.g. John Lewis Partnership)
have introduced online and mobile digital stores. Alternatively, online-only
retailers (e.g. eBay and Amazon) have moved onto the physical high street.
As the journey customers take to purchase becomes more complex,
crossing over from the physical to the virtual, they may encounter many
touchpoints. For example, a shopper who likes a product they see in a
magazine may then go to the web to find out about the product, visit a store to
see what the product looks like, make a purchase online and finally go to a
social media site to review the product. The decision for the retailer ceases to
be which channels, but how to create a seamless journey for the customer.
The solution is to adopt a multichannel approach whereby regardless of
where they interact with a retailer the shopper’s experience is the same. This
means a retailer should ensure products, prices, customer service and
communication messages are consistent. The increasing use of digital, mobile
and social media channels, giving rise to new types of customer journey–forexample, reserve online, collect from store; order in-store, delivered to home;
buy online, return unwanted goods to store–should be addressed alongside
sales performance and marketing strategy. As channel decisions become more
complex, it is increasingly important to understand the target customers.
Product assortment and customer services
Retailers decide upon the breadth of their product assortment and its depth. A
supermarket, for example, may decide to widen its product assortment from
food, drink and toiletries to include clothes, electrical goods and toys; this is
called scrambled merchandising. Within each product line it can choose to
stock a deep or shallow product range. Some retailers (e.g. JD Sports, Adidas)
specialize their product ranges, whereas others offer a much broader range of
products, including toys, cosmetics, jewellery, clothes, electrical goods and
household accessories. The growth of large e-commerce firms like Amazon,
Alibaba and eBay have made this challenging for department store brands like
Debenhams, which have been forced to close their high-street operations.
Some retailers begin with one product line and gradually broaden their product
assortment to maximize revenue per customer. For example, petrol stations
broadened their product range to include motor accessories, confectionery,
drinks, flowers and newspapers. A by-product of this may be to reduce
customers’ price sensitivity, since selection of petrol station may be based on
ability to buy other products rather than lowest price. The choice of product
assortment will be dependent on the positioning strategy of the retailer,
customer expectations and, ultimately, the profitability of each product line.
Another product decision concerns own-label branding. Large retailers
may decide to sell a range of own-label products to complement national
brands. Often the purchasing power of large retail chains means prices can be
lower and yet profit margins higher than for competing national brands. This
makes the activity an attractive proposition for many retailers. Consumers also
find own-label brands attractive, with many of those in the grocery field being
regarded as at least equal to, if not better than, established manufacturer brands
(Burt 2000).
Finally, retailers need to consider the nature and degree of customer
service. Discount stores traditionally provided little service but, as price
differentials have narrowed, some have sought differentiation through service.
For example, many electrical goods retailers provide a comprehensive after-page 665
sales service package for their customers. Superior customer service may make
customers more tolerant of higher prices.
Price
For some market segments, price is a key factor in store choice. Consequently,
some retailers use price as their differential advantage. This requires vigilant
cost control and significant buying power. Where price is a key choice
criterion, retailers that lose price competitiveness can suffer. For example,
Carrefour, the world’s second-largest retailer after Walmart, lost its reputation
for low prices in France because of its focus on profit margins rather than
volume. Market share plummeted in the face of intense competition from its
domestic rivals E.Leclerc and Auchan, and discounters such as Germany’s Aldi
and Lidl (Economist 2005). The popular trend is towards the everyday low
prices favoured by retailers, rather than higher prices supplemented by
promotions supported by manufacturers. Retailers such as Aldi, Lidl and Asda
maintain customers prefer predictable low prices rather than occasional
money-off deals, three-for-two offers and free gifts. Supermarket chains are
also pressurizing suppliers to provide consistently low prices rather than
temporary promotions. This action is consistent with the desire to position
themselves on a low-price platform.
Store atmosphere
Atmosphere is created by the design, colour and layout of a store. Both
exterior and interior design affect atmosphere.
External factors include architectural design, signs, window displays and
use of colour, which together create an identity for a retailer and attract
customers. Retailers aim to create a welcoming rather than intimidating mood.
The image projected should be consonant with the ethos of the shop. The Body
Shop, for example, projects its environmentally caring image through the
green exterior of its shops and through window displays that feature
environmental issues, a look maintained when L’Oréal acquired the brand.
Interior design also has a major impact on atmosphere. Store lighting,
layout, and fixtures and fittings are important considerations. Supermarkets
that have narrow aisles, which contribute to congestion, can project a negativeimage, and poorly lit showrooms can feel intimidating. Colour, sound and
smell can affect mood. Sometimes red-toned lighting is used in areas of
impulse purchasing. For example, one stationery retailer uses red tones at the
front of its stores for impulse buys such as pens and stationery. Supermarkets
often use music to create a relaxed atmosphere, whereas some boutiques use
contemporary music to attract their target customers. Department stores often
place perfume counters near the entrance, and supermarkets may use the smell
of baking bread to attract customers.
Online retailing
Selling online is not new. In business-to-business markets, dedicated e￾commerce systems have facilitated trading between channel members across
the supply chain for nearly half a century. However, selling to consumers using
e-commerce systems is relatively new. While the first consumer sales online
took place in 1994, it was not until 2005 that online shopping really took hold
and became a significant retail marketplace (Ellis-Chadwick 2018). UK
shoppers are spending significant amounts of money online, representing
approximately 24.4 per cent of total retail sales (ONS 2022).
Buying and selling online (web or mobile) is potentially more complex
than physical retailing where goods and services are offered by the retailer to
the consumer. Online there are many new possibilities to trade, interact and
engage with online markets (Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick 2019). Consumers
can trade with consumers through online gateways like eBay (peer-to-peer
auction site) and Etsy (e-commerce site selling handmade and vintage items).
Social commerce is possible via social media networks like Facebook,
Pinterest and Instagram, and is creating opportunities for brands. Pinterest has
60 million ‘Buyable Pins’, which can be bought with one click; Facebook’s
marketplace is approaching 600 million users. Many young consumers prefer
to buy in social spaces. The expansion of this form of purchasing raises new
challenges for retailers, who must determine where their consumers spend
most of their time online (Brown 2018). Mobile commerce enables
communication and purchasing online via wireless telecoms networks using
mobile phones and other mobile devices. To succeed in this channel, retailers
must be prepared to adapt their websites so they translate accurately to the
screen of a mobile phone, and offer the shopping efficiency, price benefits and
transaction security shoppers expect (Chi 2018). In response to this
opportunity to reach and sell to consumers almost everywhere, many retailerspage 666
have developed apps–specially designed applications for mobile devices–to
enable shopping on the go. Shoppers are increasingly making use of apps, and
savvy retailers and service providers have developed solutions that are easy to
use.
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapter Detailed Review
1. The functions and types of channels of distribution
The functions are to reconcile the needs of producers and consumers, improve
efficiency, improve accessibility and provide specialist services.
Four types of consumer channel are: producer direct to consumer; producer to
retailer to consumer; producer to wholesaler to retailer to consumer; and producer
to agent to wholesaler to retailer to consumer.
Four types of industrial channels are: producer to industrial customer; producer to
agent to industrial customer; producer to distributor to industrial customer; and
producer to agent to distributor to industrial customer.page 667
Two types of service channel are: service provider to consumer or industrial
customer; and service provider to agent to consumer or industrial customer.
2. How to determine channel strategy
Channel strategy should be determined by making decisions
concerning the selection of the most effective distribution channel, the most
appropriate level of distribution intensity and the correct degree of channel
integration.
3. The three components of channel strategy: channel selection, intensity and
integration
Channel selection is influenced by market factors (buyer behaviour, ability to meet
buyer needs, the willingness of channel intermediaries to market a product, the
profit margins required by distributors and agents compared with the costs of
direct distribution, and the location and geographic concentration of customers),
producer factors (lack of resources, the width and depth of the product mix offered
by a producer, and the desired level of control of channel operations), product
factors (complexity, perishability, extent of bulkiness and difficulty of handling) and
competitive factors (need to choose innovative channels because traditional
channels are controlled by the competition or because a competitive advantage is
likely to result).
Channel intensity options are intensive distribution to achieve saturated coverage
of the market by using all available outlets, selective distribution, where a limited
number of outlets in a geographical area are used, and exclusive distribution,
which is an extreme form of selective distribution where only one wholesaler,
retailer or industrial distributor is used in a geographical area.
Channel integration can range from conventional marketing channels (where there
is separation of ownership between producer and distributor, although the
manufacturer power of channel intermediaries may result in an administered
vertical marketing system), franchising and channel ownership.
4. The five key channel management issues: member selection, motivation,
training, evaluation and conflict management
Selection of members involves identifying sources and establishing selection
criteria.
Motivation of distributors involves understanding the needs and problems of
distributors, and methods include financial rewards, territorial exclusivity, providing
resource support, and the development of strong work relationships.
Training may be provided where appropriate. It can provide the necessary
technical knowledge about a supplier company and its products, and help to build
a spirit of partnership and commitment.
Evaluation criteria include sales volume and value, profitability, level of stocks,
quality and position of display, new accounts opened, selling and marketing
capabilities, quality of service, market information feedback, willingness and ability
to meet commitments, attitudes and personal capability. Evaluation should be
based on mutually agreed objectives.
Conflict management sources are differences in goals, differences in desired
product lines, the use of multiple distribution channels by producers, and
inadequacies in performance. Conflict-handling approaches are developing apage 668
partnership approach, training in conflict handling, market partitioning, improving
performance, channel ownership and coercion.
5. Retailing: physical and digital channels to market
Physical distribution management concerns the balance between cost reduction
and meeting customer service requirements. An example of a trade-off is
incompatibility between low inventory and slow, cheaper transportation methods
that reduce costs, and the resulting lower customer service levels and satisfaction.
Virtual channels facilitate the flow of products, cash and information, but increase
the complexity of channel management.
Digital channels have encouraged businesses to adopt a multichannel approach to
distribution in pursuit of providing a seamless customer journey. The supply chain
has been transformed by digital technology, enabling increasingly sophisticated
marketing initiatives.
6. How to improve customer service standards in physical distribution
Customer service standards can be raised by improving product availability (e.g.
by increasing inventory levels), improving order cycle times (e.g. faster order
processing), raising information levels (e.g. information on order status) and
improving flexibility (e.g. fast reaction time to problems).
7. Retailing and retail marketing
Retailing fulfils an essential role in the supply chain by breaking bulk
and enabling goods manufactured in very large quantities to be supplied to
consumers in very small quantities. This process has many implications for
channel management. Furthermore, marketing mix decisions, positioning and
other marketing concepts have particular meaning when applied to retailing.
Retail positioning involves the choice of target marketing and use of the marketing
mix to develop differential advantage.
Store location decisions are made using a number of variables, from convenience
to the disposable income of a particular catchment area.
Product assortment decisions focus on the breadth and depth of range, which
enables retailers to tailor their product mix to suit particular audiences.
Pricing is important in retailing, and retailers need to ensure they manage cost
control and levels of pricing effectively.
Store atmosphere–internal and external design, colour and store layout can all
have an impact on consumer buying behaviour.
8. Online, social and mobile commerce
Selling online has become popular and accounts for around 10 per cent of retail
sales. Buying and selling online is more complex than physical retailing, and
retailers have to work out where best to engage with their customers: social media
networks, the web or mobile apps.

CASE 31ASOS AND ONLINE
FASHION
ASOS is the UK’s largest online-only fashion retailer, selling more than 850 brands and,
according to its 2022 annual report, targeting ‘fashion-loving 20-somethings around the world’.
Until recently, the firm had experienced phenomenal growth based on showing young shoppers
how to emulate the designer looks of celebrities, especially during the Covid pandemic, when
many people turned to buying online. However, post-pandemic the combination of global
uncertainty and financial recession has meant shoppers are spending less on fashion due to
the rising cost of living and economic pressures in many countries across Europe.

The outlook for this once promising online brand is now unclear as it has lost value and
experienced a lack of growth in international retail markets. This case examines the rise of
ASOS as a multichannel retailer and considers the challenges affecting its future as a flagship
UK online retailer.
Background
ASOS was founded in 2000 by Nick Robertson. In 1996, he set up a business called
Entertainment Marketing to place products in films and television programmes. By 2000,
Robertson was running a website called As Seen On Screen, showing and selling brands that
were used in films and on TV – from a pair of Oakley sunglasses worn by Tom Cruise in
Mission Impossible to a pestle and mortar used by TV chef Jamie Oliver. But it was fashion that
proved the biggest success, and Robertson decided to focus on that. ASOS was born.
The firm offers more than 85,000 branded and own-label product lines, including womenswear,
menswear, footwear, accessories, jewellery and beauty – a much wider range than offered by
other online rivals such as Nobody’s Child and New Look. Its key target market is women aged
18–34, with half of the online retailer’s customers aged under 25. They demand new items topage 673
choose from, and ASOS provides this. Stock turnover (the speed at which items are replaced)
is nine weeks, ensuring that visitors to the site are rewarded with new items on offer.
The firm has its own design team and has close links with suppliers. This means, from the
moment of spotting a celebrity wearing a new style of dress, ASOS designers and buyers are in
a position to have similar designs made and ready to sell in four weeks. Products are sold
under several brands: from own-label celebrity-lookalike items to its own luxury brand, ASOS
Design, ASOS Edition, Collusion and Reclaimed Vintage. It also sells third-party brands to bring
together a curated range of fashion brands including Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge with
well-established Nike, Levi’s, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and others.
A Digital Brand With Multiple Channels
A major anchor in the success of ASOS is its website, which attracts approaching 90 million
visitors a month. On the website at any one time there are thousands of styles of dresses, tops,
trousers, shoes, bags, lingerie, swimwear and jewellery, for both men and women. At ASOS
headquarters in north London, studios provide a runway where a pool of models bring the
clothes to life and transmit the excitement of the catwalk to the consumer.
As well as the website, the brand attracts customers through display advertising, search engine
marketing and customer referrals, which helps maintain customer numbers and keeps it in
touch with the 26.4 million active customers (those who have bought within the past 6 to 12
months), who place orders worth, on average, £70. Women’s fashion items make up the vast
majority of sales; menswear accounts for 20 per cent of sales; with beauty and cosmetics
representing a further 3 per cent.
ASOS also has more than 20 million social media followers. Search engine optimization and
pay-per-click advertising on women’s magazine sites such as Look and Grazia help to generate
traffic to ASOS’s site. Social networking also plays a part in raising awareness. ASOS has the
second-largest UK fan group of any fashion retailer on Facebook (behind H&M). When ASOS
first launched a Facebook application allowing customers to make purchases from the store
without leaving the social networking site, this was a boost to online sales. In the UK, half of
sales come from mobile devices, and ASOS has launched a mobile app that allows customers
to upload photos snapped from the pages of magazines or social media to search for similar
outfits on its website.
ASOS connects with its target market through email marketing and the creation of communities
on social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter, to keep customers aware of special
promotions and new products. Platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, Hulu
and Roku are also used to communicate with its customer base. Bu using digital channels
ASOS achieves 87 per cent brand awareness among its target consumers.
Challenges and Opportunities
Operational challengespage 674
One problem with buying online rather than in a traditional retail outlet is that returns are higher.
An average catalogue firm experiences about 40 per cent returns, but ASOS achieves the
much lower figure of 25 per cent. A key feature of ASOS’s marketing tactics is to offer free
delivery for orders over £35 and free returns in the UK. By giving free returns to customers in all
European countries where it operates ASOS offers customers the opportunity to try on items
before buying them. This means they do not have to claim a refund for items they return to
ASOS. Streamlining this aspect of online fashion shopping enabled the brand to grow its
competitive advantage.
Strategic partnerships and acquisitions
Working with partners has been part of ASOS’s long-standing strategy and has created
opportunities for innovative collaborations, which extend choice for end consumers and build
strong relationships with third-party brands. The innovative Partnership Fulfils programme,
which sees ASOS working with Reebok, Nike and Adidas, has enabled it to expand its
territories in Europe and increase customer satisfaction by reducing stock outages. This
expanded approach to collaboration means creating opportunities for independent boutiques to
thrive. In 2021 ASOS bought Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge from the collapsed Arcadia
empire, with the intention of marketing them as online-only brands. In addition, a deal was
made with US department store chain Nordstrom to sell Topshop clothing in its outlets.
International trade
A major source of sales and profit growth has been overseas expansion, with new websites
having been established in the US, Germany, France, Spain, Denmark, Italy and Australia. A
large European hub has been built in Germany, near Berlin, and in the US a dedicated £30
million warehouse in Atlanta was opened to supplement the one in Ohio. ASOS supplies goods
to countries around the globe and 60 per cent of its revenue is now generated from
international sales. ASOS is not alone in selling online fashion worldwide. For example,
boohoo.com dispatches to 100 countries and is differentiated from ASOS as all of its clothes
are own-brand and sell at lower price points. Its target market is 16 to 24 year olds who are
looking for inexpensive fashion items. In Europe ASOS faces intense competition from the
German group Zalando, which is an online retailer of fashion, shoes and beauty products, and
has around 49 million active customers in 25 European countries.
The Future
The marketing environment is impacting on retail performance globally as geopolitical events,
the physical environment and economic uncertainty create difficult trading conditions. But
ASOS intends to survive and thrive by focusing on improving operational
performance, increasing flexibility and capitalizing on core strengths. More
specifically, ASOS intends to revive its revenues by creating even greater product choice and
connecting more closely with local markets, while investing in marketing to drive growth.
Questionspage 675
1. Discuss how the marketing environment is impacting on online fashion retailers.
2. How is ASOS delivering value to its customers in Europe and across the globe?
3. Carry out desk research and perform a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats
(SWOT) analysis on ASOS to assess the brand’s future plans.
4. On the basis of your SWOT analysis, make strategic recommendations for ASOS and
suggest refinements to its strategy.

A LOOK INTO SEPHORA’S
OMNICHANNEL STRATEGY
Introduction
Sephora, owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH), is a French luxury retailer
selling beauty products, with various stores in 29 countries. It is currently expanding its
presence in the Asia Pacific region into countries such as Australia, China and India. The
retailer sells products from a wide range of categories, including skincare, make-up and
fragrance, from brands that are well known as well as emerging brands and its own private
label (Sephora 2022). Sephora has a history of innovation, being the first beauty retailer to
allow customers to try products before purchase (CB Insights 2018). With the creation of its
Innovation Lab, Sephora can find novel ways to improve its business, including testing store
layout or creating and testing digital experiences to enhance the customer shopping experience
(Nagy 2015). Innovation is a key focus within Sephora, so it is not surprising it was one of the
first beauty retailers to integrate an omnichannel approach. The retailer has collaborated with
Instagram to become one of the first beauty retailers to sell on the platform, integrate chatbots
into its customer service strategy and use augmented reality to help customers try products in a
virtual environment.

Sephora’s Vision
Sephora’s chief technology officer, Sree Sreedhararaj, says the retailer’s omnichannel strategy
is informed by a vision of seamless customer experiences (Abramovich 2021). To implement
this approach, Sephora first attempted to understand customer behaviour and found that
customers often make their first purchase in a physical store to become familiar with the brand
(Rao 2018). So the marketing strategy team determined in-store experiences as vital in creating
a long-lasting relationship with the customer. On becoming repeat customers, the customers
purchase from a mix of channels, both online and in-store, and show a preference for viewing
products online. Consequently, the alignment between physical and digital becomes more
important than ever. One way in which Sephora established this channel alignment was by
merging its digital and physical retail teams. This enabled Sephora to make better use of digital
analytics, such as to better understand its customers’ shopping habits, and to create enhanced
synergies between channels (Honingam 2022). Using digital analytics, Sephora was able to
establish customer frustration points that create barriers to purchase, for example not knowing
which products to buy or how to use products. Such insights allowed Sephora to adjust its
strategies across channels to ensure there are appropriate communications at each customer
touchpoint. Communications touchpoints range from offering in-store sales as purchase
incentives to educating customers as to the proper application of products, both online
(Honingam 2022) and in-store, with the help of beauty advisors, as well as allowing customers
to experiment with its products. Beauty advisors are equipped with mobile devices that enable
them to email customers after an in-store makeover. This helps Sephora reconnect with a
customer once they have left the store (Rao 2018).
Recreating an In-store Experience
A key focus of Sephora’s omnichannel strategy is on recreating an in-store experience on
digital platforms (Abramovich 2021), while ensuring the in-store and digital experience are
seamless and personalized to the customer (Rao 2018). Sephora recognized that
the in-store experience is still valued by its customers, especially after the Covid￾19 pandemic, when stores were closed for some time (Abramovich 2021). One experience
particularly valued by customers is the ability to speak to a member of the sales team when
browsing or making decisions. To mimic this, Sephora implemented the use of chatbots via
Facebook Messenger and Kik instant messaging app in 2016 (Wang 2021). It became one of
the first retailers to use chatbots (Parisi 2017). These chatbots support the customer service
efforts of Sephora by making the process more efficient and flexible for customers. Enquiries
can be answered 24 hours a day, so customers do not need to wait for opening hours.
Customers can make appointments using the chatbot and receive immediate confirmation, and
can read product reviews and recommendations. The chatbots use artificial intelligence (AI) to
simulate conversations and recognize products. For example, users can hold their phone
against a picture of a person and the chatbot can recognize the products needed to recreate
the look (Parisi 2017). Similarly, users can also experiment with different products to try
different looks using the chatbots (McKinnon 2018).
The chatbots are another touchpoint for customers and, importantly, one that is customer led:
customers can decide when and how to interact. This creates a more personalized experience
for the customer. Despite the advances in terms of AI, chatbots have their limitations and are
typically most effective when customers ask them fairly simple questions (Sellman 2021).
Nonetheless, the use of conversational interaction gives customers another channel that is
personalized and focused on a customer-led experience. These contactless interactions offer a
similar experience to putting questions to in-store sales staff.page 677
Other experiences customers valued were aspects such as being able to try products and
experiment. These were recreated through augmented reality (AR) with the chatbots and within
the Sephora app, in a feature called Sephora Virtual Artist. This AR technology allows users to
try different products on their face virtually, and lets them know which products were tested so
they can add these to their basket (Hartmens 2017). Sephora Virtual Artist was also integrated
into stores for customers to try products virtually while shopping in person (Abramovich 2021),
demonstrating how the retailer is bringing digital into its in-store experience. Customers can
access the app to view Sephora’s library of make-up tutorials, to recreate the looks tried on
Sephora Virtual Artist (Hartmens 2017). Kik users can access these tutorials through the
chatbot too (Wang 2021). This has the effect of encouraging customers to spend more time
interacting with the retailer and learning about its products, potentially increasing purchase
intention.
Along with AI chatbots and beauty advisors, Sephora makes use of social media (Twitter,
Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, Snapchat and TikTok). All of Sephora’s social media
serve as useful touchpoints to form a brand image – beneficial for new and potential customers
– and reinforce this. Effort is put into ensuring each platform is consistent with the brand image.
Separately, Sephora uses these social media channels for different functionalities. Facebook
can be used for booking appointments. Twitter and Instagram allow the retailer to resolve
customer complaints (Lukis 2020). TikTok platforms share promotion codes that take users
directly to the checkout page, making the transaction process as efficient as possible for the
potential purchaser (TikTok 2022). In the past, Sephora used Snapchat to create a game where
participants could win vouchers to use in the online store (Snapchat 2019).
Sephora recognizes that social connections are valued by its customers, both in terms of
connecting with Sephora, as customers would with their own social circle (Rao 2018), and with
other users of Sephora. As a result, Sephora’s marketing strategy places importance on
building and engaging with customers (Sonsev 2018). One of the ways Sephora encourages
customer-to-customer interaction is through its own social forum, Beauty Insider Community,
which is available only to members of Sephora’s loyalty programme (Beauty Insiders), giving a
feeling of exclusivity to the forum. A customer’s forum profile is linked to their loyalty
programme profile, which makes it easier for both customer and Sephora to retrieve or store
information. However, the appeal of the forum lies in its ability to allow customers to connect
and interact with one another. Posts from the Sephora customer services team and from
customers make up the bulk of forum activities, where customers can ask questions, read other
customers’ product reviews, and share or view make-up looks with instructions for recreating
them. Additionally, customers can access the Live Community Chat, which allows them to
interact in real time to seek advice and opinions (King 2017).
Changes in Customer Behaviour
These omnichannel approaches are especially important given the changes in customer
behaviour in recent years. Some changes occurred as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic
changing customer behaviour and expectations, such as increasing interest in engaging with
brands online and buying online (Gerstell et al. 2020). Other changes had been gradually
creeping into the sector anyway, due to technological developments and customer adoption,
such as mobile becoming central to customers’ behaviour (Rao 2018). One of the
reasons the omnichannel approaches used by Sephora have been successful is
because they aligned to these changing customer needs.
Mobile adoption has influenced the biggest change in customer behaviour within the beauty
sector, particularly affecting commerce (Rao 2018). Customers now expect businesses to be onthe platforms they spend time on, and to be able to connect with businesses as they would with
their social networks. Covid-19 further increased the rate at which customers interact with
businesses on digital platforms, and many appear to prefer digital channels, leading to an
expectation from customers that businesses will improve digital services (Murphy 2021).
Sephora recognized that digital and mobile technologies integrated into an omnichannel
marketing strategy can support the meeting of these customer expectations (Abramovich
2021). The use of chatbots, for example, satisfies the customer need to interact on digital
channels while being immediate and customer led.
In addition, chatbots satisfy a growing customer desire for personalized experiences (Rao
2018), which can also be seen in other aspects of the customer journey – for example, the
purchase stage, where customers now seek flexibility in terms of how and where they purchase
products, as well as how they obtain products. In response, Sephora has made it easier to
purchase products online, such as offering ‘reserve online pick up in-store’ options, offering
same-day delivery with its Instacart collaboration, and purchase through Instagram Checkout
(Abramovich 2021) or TikTok (TikTok 2022). Customers can pay for their purchases using
Klarna, a financial service that allows them to pay in instalments, further increasing the options
available to customers and enhancing Sephora’s attractiveness among the younger audience
who use this payment method (Abramovich 2021).
Sephora is increasingly aiming to target younger audiences, especially Gen Z (Wischhover
2019). This is an audience that tends to have different needs, such as being most comfortable
communicating through chat and social (Rao 2018). Chatbots and the social forum have
become strategic omnichannels for Sephora, as they provide touchpoints to encourage Gen Z
to continue to the different parts of the customer journey. This may be booking a make-up
appointment, followed by an email from a beauty advisor detailing the products used, and the
customer experimenting and sharing looks with the Beauty Insider Community. Furthermore,
Gen Z values authenticity (Wischhover 2019) and the social forum allows customers to connect
with other customers based on a similar interest in Sephora. Sephora understands the value to
be gained from customers interacting with one another; customers are using one of the official
touchpoints of Sephora, so are still engaging with the retailer, which helps build experiences
and develop trust. The social forum is a useful addition to other channels used by Sephora,
acting as another information point and product exploration opportunity, which supports the
customer journey.
Conclusion
The omnichannels used by Sephora go beyond offering customers different channels for
browsing or purchasing, and beyond a strategy for the retailer to learn more about its
customers’ behaviours and needs. The retailer aims to create a seamless interaction
experience for its customers (Abramovich 2021). This means recognizing that customers have
different needs at different stages of their journey, and omnichannel marketing allows
customers to use different channels and touchpoints at these different stages (Berman and
Thelen 2018). This could be a need for product information at the start of the journey (such as
the use of chatbots or beauty advisors in-store), product experimentation during decision￾making (for example, through the Beauty Insider Community) or having a variety of purchase
options (such as online, in-store or in-store pick-up options). Creating seamless engagement
also means recognizing that customers have different preferences and styles when interacting
with organizations, and an omnichannel approach enables customers to choose how and when
they wish to engage. This ties in with Sephora’s vision to provide a customer-led and
personalized experience (Rao 2018; Abramovich 2021).page 678

art 1 of this book explores the fundamentals of marketing, which inform
the development of a marketing plan; Part 2 considers how core elements
of marketing can be used to create value for customers; Part 3 studies how
to communicate and deliver customer value. In Part 4, our attention turns to
how to bring all these elements of marketing theory and practice together in a
cohesive and coherent manner. The focus is on managing, planning and
applying strategic thinking within the framework of marketing.This chapter explores the marketing planning framework and discusses
ways to develop a manageable approach towards implementing the marketing
concept (as discussed in Chapter 1). Chapter 18 focuses on specific strategic
notions – competitor analysis – and in doing so presents ways of creating
competitive advantage. Chapter 19 examines product strategy and looks at
ways in which products can be used for growth. Chapter 20 investigates what
is involved in developing global marketing strategies. Chapter 21 discusses
implementation, and many issues at the heart of the application of the
principles and practice of marketing.
Marketing planning and strategy comprises a complex and resource￾intensive set of processes that can deliver great rewards if fully embraced.
However, the marketing environment is in flux: digital technologies are
disrupting and reshaping the marketing landscape, and speeding up the rate of
change; in addition, political change, unrest in Europe and climate events are
impacting on the marketing environment. For marketing to function effectively
and efficiently across an organization, it should act as a guiding business
philosophy for improving performance in synergy with its marketing
environment. Therefore, to gain the potential advantages from marketing,
managers should communicate marketing planning decisions throughout the
organization, for example informing which customer groups to serve, how to
create value-added products and services, which technology to use and which
marketing strategies are most likely to deliver competitive advantages.
Managers should also consider the impact of the environment and determine
how to achieve the best strategic fit between their organization’s capabilities
and resources and the market opportunities.
This chapter presents the marketing planning framework, addressing
many of the key questions and decisions a manager might encounter, and
providing a straightforward, structured framework for handling all the
complexities that marketers must accommodate. We begin the chapter by
considering the marketing planning context. After that, we delve into the key
functions of marketing planning, before exploring the stages in the marketing
planning process. The chapter concludes by looking at the rewards and
problems of marketing planning.
Marketing Planning ContextMarketing planning is part of a broader concept of corporate strategic
planning, which involves all business functions: marketing, operations,
finance, human resources, information management, distribution and the
trading environment. The aim of corporate strategic planning is to provide
direction so that a firm can direct its activities to meet high-level corporate
objectives, for example being market leader or improving profitability.
Marketing links to this high level of strategic planning by managing the
interface between a firm and its environment, for instance a corporate
objective to be market leader will take account of the economic forces and
their impact on a market. For example, the marketing planning team carrying
out a marketing audit will produce sufficient knowledge to enable the
corporate management team to make long-term strategic decisions, thereby
creating a link between strategy and marketing planning.
The role of marketing planning in strategy development is complex and
can vary considerably in terms of what is involved. At the simplest level, a
firm may market only one product in one market. In this case, the role of
marketing planning is to ensure that the marketing plan for the product
matches its customers’ needs. Also, the firm can use all available resources to
achieve its marketing objectives (e.g. to sell more products). This should also
enable the marketing plan to feed in to the corporate objective of becoming
market leader. However, this is rarely the case, as companies tend to offer
many products and/or services to many different target markets. In this
situation, decisions should be made about the allocation of resources to each
product and/or service. This is far from a straightforward process, as resource
allocation is dependent on the attractiveness of the market for each product,
and the capabilities and resources of the firm. Read Hidden Gem 17.1 to find
out how Gymshark built a brand by working hard, being humble and
exploiting market opportunities.
HIDDEN GEM 17.1
Gymshark: Being Hard-working, Humble and
Disruptive DeliversSource: T. Schneider/Shutterstock
Gymshark is a brand built around a community of its stakeholders: customers, athletes,
employees, suppliers and followers. Started in Ben Francis’s garage in Birmingham, UK, in
2012, with a sewing machine, a screen printer and help from family, friends and specialist
training from his grandmother, who gave him the skills he needed to use the machine. This
firm has become a successful international brand within 10 years, giving it ‘unicorn’ status
for being a privately-owned firm, valued at over $1 billion and only the second UK company
to achieve such heights.
Mission and leadership vision
Originally the driving reason to build the brand was to create the clothes Ben and his friends
wanted to wear. Today the mission statement focuses on respect and staying humble. Steve
Hewitt, former CEO and now executive chair, believes everyone can work hard and needs
‘zero talent to stay humble’. With this underlying philosophy and respect for all, he believes
everyone can get things right and do well on this brand’s journey. Keeping things simple has
enabled Gymshark to build scale and develop capacity, which has resulted in its significant
growth.
The marketing environment
Consumer interest in fitness and well-being has been on the increase, and research
revealed nearly 80 per cent of respondents to a survey of 7,500 across six countries said
wellness is important and a lifestyle priority. Globally, the wellness market is estimated at
more than $1.5 trillion, opening huge opportunities for firms serving these markets. The
global pandemic focused attention on well-being and Gymshark, responding to these
marketplace trends, benefited. During the pandemic, the firm employed out-of-work
personal trainers to produce content for its workout app, which linked with millions of
shoppers in lockdown.
Strategy and objectivespage 683
Gymshark likes doing things differently and is constantly building in agility so the firm can
respond rapidly to emerging trends in the market environment. Its target market is specific:
its core customers are 18–25 year olds (Gen Z), focused on fitness and enjoying life. The
firm’s strategic thrust objectives revolve around maintaining market penetration, while
building capacity through product development.
Competitive advantage
Tuning in to its Gen Z target audience via social media gives Gymshark a competitive edge
as it instantly knows what the big topics of interest are, and can plan how to respond quickly
to emerging trends. Social media is the preferred communication channel for this generation
of shoppers and Gymshark uses it to good effect. Building community connections is critical
if Gymshark is to stay ahead of its key competitors (e.g. lululemon, Under Armour, Nike,
Adidas).
Mix decisions
Influencer marketing helped the brand become established with Gen Z. In the early days,
few firms used influencers, and this helped Ben and his team to gain detailed insights and
access to the target market, from which it built a community that currently has more than 10
million followers on social media. Partnering with successful YouTubers like Lex Griffin and
Nikki Blackketter early on, and high-profile Instagram influencer Steve Cook more recently,
has helped the brand build a stronger online community of social media influencers and
their followers.
Using macro- and micro-influencers: While YouTubers and Instagrammers with large
follower bases help to expose Gymshark, the brand also employs micro-influencers,
who can be more effective and less costly to use. Micro-influencers share opinions,
endorse products and stimulate conversations. And research suggests this has a
greater influence on consumer choice and purchase intentions (Kay et al. 2020).
Brand ambassadors and sponsorship of athletes also adds to the community, helps with
brand positioning and reputation, and builds long-term community relationships.
Distribution: Gymshark aims to get its products out quickly to customers, and to provide
an integrated and seamless customer experience. Investment into its IT and online
infrastructure has enabled links between the physical and digital world to appear
seamless and give a great customer experience – expanding into offline opening of
retail stores to expand the distribution network nationally (UK) and internationally (US,
Europe and Australasia).
The firm has built its corporate reputation trading online and now reaches customers in 230
countries via 14 online stores. This is a firm that has achieved recognition and corporate
success by keeping things simple, doing things well … and working hard to get there.

To add to the complexity, a firm may comprise several discrete but
connected divisions (or totally separate companies) each of which serves
distinct groups of customers and has a distinct set of competitors (Day 1984).
For example, the Virgin Group operates many firms in different activity
sectors: entertainment (Virgin Radio), travel (Virgin Atlantic Airways),
technology (Virgin Media, Virgin Mobile). Each business is strategically
autonomous and thus forms a strategic business unit (SBU). For example, the
Virgin Group is made up of a community of independently operating firms. A
major component of a strategic plan – at the corporate level – is allocation of
resources to each SBU. Strategic decisions at the corporate level are normally
concerned with acquisition, divestment and diversification (Weitz and Wensley
1988). In the Virgin Group example, each firm contributes to the overarching
aims of the group – that is, Virgin Media was created through mergers with
NTL, Telewest and Virgin Mobile. The decisions to add or release a business
are taken at the corporate and strategic planning level. Richard Branson,
founder of the Virgin empire, expanded the business’s reach by entering
diverse markets: finance and insurance (Virgin Money in Australia, South
Africa and the UK), health clubs (Virgin Active in the UK, Italy, South Africa
and Thailand), gaming (Virgin Casino in the US and UK). Marketing feeds in
to such corporate decision-making by identifying opportunities and threats in
the environment. Thus the opportunity to develop the travel arm of the Virgin
Group by adding Virgin Hotels is likely to have emerged from marketing
planning actions.
In summary, marketing planning is part of the overarching corporate
strategic planning process and provides a range of insights from the trading
environment to identify target markets and customer needs. There are two
other aspects of marketing planning to consider: the core functions and key
planning processes of marketing planning.
The Functions of Marketing PlanningArguably, the core function of a marketing plan is to answer the following four
questions:
1. Where are we now?
2. Where would we like to be?
3. How do we get there?
4. Are we on course?
For the marketing planning team at Virgin, answering these questions
means considering the points described below.
Where are we now? Looking at the current position of the business in terms
of its past performance, considering the effectiveness of previous marketing
plans and questioning what might happen if there were no changes in
current practice. In its annual financial statement, Virgin Atlantic reported
strong performance against its objectives, managing its resources effectively
through continuing tough economic conditions and against strong
competition in the airline industry (Virgin Atlantic 2018).
Where would we like to be? The future direction of the business is defined
by its marketing objectives. Virgin’s corporate objective is to ‘offer the best
business product in the air’, so the implications for the marketing planning
team are setting suitable objectives that ensure improved customer service in
terms of its business products.
How do we get there? This can be answered in the case of Virgin Atlantic by
looking at the needs of business travellers and considering their expectations
and experiences. Virgin has won industry awards for its Upper Class Suite,
which is designed to be a first-class product for a business-class fare. The
marketing planning team looked at this key target audience (business
travellers) and devised a marketing mix strategy it could implement to
achieve its marketing objectives.
Are we on course? This question is answered by looking at performance
measures. Like many companies, Virgin measures sales and profitability, but
it uses other measures too, such as increases in fuel efficiency and reduction
in carbon emissions, targeting the use of sustainable products and renewable
resources.
The core functions of marketing planning addressed by these questions link
into specific stages in the marketing planning process (see Table 17.1). ‘Where
are we now?’ is forecast by reference to the marketing audit and SWOT
(strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis. ‘Where would wepage 686
like to be?’ is determined by the setting of marketing objectives. ‘How do we
get there?’ refers to core strategy, marketing mix decisions, organization and
implementation. Finally, ‘Are we on course?’ is answered by the establishment
of a control system.

The next section discusses the process of marketing planning in detail.
The Process of Marketing Planning
Planning is rarely straightforward. Different people are involved at various
stages of the planning process. The main marketing planning process can
broadly be divided into two distinct areas:
1. the business unit level (e.g. Virgin Atlantic)
2. the product level (e.g. Virgin flights to America).
The process of marketing planning is outlined in Figure 17.1. This
overview of the framework provides a systematic way to aid understanding of
the analysis and decision-making processes involved in marketing planning.
Additionally, the framework shows how key elements of marketing –
discussed in subsequent chapters – relate to one another and fit in to the
planning process.FIGURE 17.1
The marketing planning processpage 687
Business mission: how to define a business
Simply answer this question: ‘What does a business do to make a living?’
(Vasconcellos e Sá 2011). The answer is not always straightforward. According
to Russell Ackoff, an American organizational theorist, a business mission is
‘A broadly defined, enduring statement of purpose that distinguishes
a business from others of its type’ (Ackoff 1987). This definition
captures essential ingredients of mission statements: they are enduring and
specific to the individual organization (Hooley et al. 1992), and set out ‘What
business are we in?’ and ‘What business do we want to be in?’ (Drucker 2007).
The answers define the scope and activities of the firm and the reason for its
existence, and focus on the present.
The mission statement should not be confused with a vision statement,
which looks to the future. For example, Samsung’s 2020 vision statement for
the coming decade is ‘Inspire the world, create the future’ (Samsung n.d.),
whereas Google’s mission statement is ‘to organize the world’s information
and make it universally accessible and useful’ (Google n.d.). The mission
statement defines the business, guides the setting of objectives and how these
will be achieved, and is the foundation on which to build. A vision statement is
more aspirational and should provide an overall direction for a firm that can
inspire confidence and optimism.
A mission statement can take many forms, but it should reflect the
customer groups being served (the market), refer to the customer needs being
satisfied and describe the process by which a customer need can be satisfied.
The inclusion of market and needs ensures that the business definition is
market focused rather than product based. Thus, the purpose of a firm such as
Apple is not to manufacture computers but to solve customers’ information
problems. While this advice has merit in advocating the avoidance of a narrow
business definition, management must be wary of a definition that is too wide.
Four key influences on shaping a business mission are described below.
First, Levitt (1960), a leading American economist, argued a mission
should focus on needs and that a business should be viewed as a customer￾satisfying process not a goods-producing process. The reason for ensuring a
business definition is market focused is that products are transient, but basic
needs such as transportation, entertainment and eating are lasting. Levitt
(1960) suggested that railway companies would have survived had they
defined their business as transportation and moved into the airline business.
But this is to ignore the limits of the business competence of the railways: didrailway companies possess the necessary skills and resources to run an airline?
However, by adopting a customer perspective, new opportunities are more
likely to be revealed. For example, Apple has streamlined its product ranges
and focused its innovations on customers’ needs, and in so doing has
overturned major consumer electronics product categories: its iPhone
transformed the smartphone market, the iPad made tablet computing more
mainstream, while the Apple Watch took technology closer to the human body,
freeing people from their phones (Pierce 2015).
A second influence on the mission is based on the work of Ansoff (1987),
who stressed the importance of the product (or service) offer, which defines
and differentiates a firm.
A third influence, proposed by Hanan (1974), argued the importance of the
client and suggested that a business should focus the mission statement around
the importance of the customer.
A fourth influence is global location (Vasconcellos e Sá 2011). The
location of a firm’s target markets can define the products and services it
offers, the distribution channels it uses and the extent of its trading operation.
Free-trade agreements, global communications and transportation systems
have widened horizons for all firms.
Ultimately, a firm’s mission should reflect all four influences, and should
also:
provide a solid understanding of the business and the forces acting on its
operations, which might change in the future. For example, PayPal is a
business with a clear mission: ‘to democratize financial services to ensure
that everyone, regardless of background or economic standing, has access to
affordable, convenient and secure products and services to take control of
their financial lives’ (PayPal 2022). Originally, Confinity Inc. created
PayPal as a service that would allow funds to be transferred between Palm
Pilots (handheld personal digital devices). But it was not long before the
firm signed an agreement with eBay to enable instantaneous payments for
its millions of auction transactions (Davis 2014). Then, mobile commerce
proved to be another tipping point for PayPal as it extended its offer beyond
eBay’s auction platform to offer a truly one-touch financial payment
solution (Hazan 2014). As digital finance evolves and PayPal’s competitors
increase, the brand continues to transform its operations to meet the needs of
consumers and merchants, introducing new and/or improved checkout and
payment processes, marketing tools and digital wallets (PayPal 2021).page 688
encapsulate the personal conviction and motivation of the leader, who can
make his or her ideas become contagious. For example, Walt Disney wrote
his firm’s mission statement, ‘To make people happy’, which is both
contagious and motivating for staff (Sanghera 2005). Jeff Bezos’s vision and
mission for Amazon was ‘to be the Earth’s most customer-centric
firm, to build a place where people can come to find and discover
anything they might want to buy online’ (Gapper and Jopson 2011). His
passion and commitment have led the firm through challenging times to
become the world’s leading consumer e-commerce firm. Turn to Chapter 21,

create strategic intent of winning throughout the organization. This helps to
build a sense of common purpose, and stresses the need to create
competitive advantages rather than settle for imitative moves.
enable success. Managers must believe they have the latitude to make
decisions about strategy without being second-guessed by top management.
In summary, the mission statement provides the framework within which
managers decide which opportunities and threats to address and which to
disregard. A well-defined mission statement is a key element in the marketing
planning process, as it defines boundaries within which new opportunities are
sought and motivates staff to succeed in the implementation of marketing
strategy. A vision statement describes where a firm wants to be in the future.

Marketing Audit
According to Brownlie (1993, 1996), the marketing audit is a systematic
examination of a business’s marketing environment, objectives, strategies and
activities, with a view to identifying key strategic issues, problem areas and
opportunities. It is also a means for evaluating marketing practices, for efficacy
and compliance, and not only detecting problems but also providing insights
for planning solutions (Wu et al. 2015). The marketing audit provides the basis
for developing and monitoring a plan of action to improve marketing
performance, should be done regularly, and should provide answers to the
questions ‘Where are we now?’, ‘How did we get here?’ and ‘Where are we
heading?’
Answers to these questions depend upon an analysis of the environment of
a business. This analysis benefits from a clear mission statement, since the
latter defines the boundaries of the environmental scan and helps decisions
regarding which strategic issues and opportunities are important.
The internal audit focuses on those areas under the control of marketing
management, whereas the external audit is concerned with those forces over
which management has no control. The results of the marketing audit are a key
determinant of the future direction of the business and may give rise to a
redefined business mission statement. Alongside the marketing audit, a
business may conduct audits of other functional areas, such as production,
finance and personnel. The coordination and integration of these audits
produces a composite business plan in which marketing issues play a central
role, since they concern decisions about which products to manufacture for
which markets. These decisions clearly have production, financial and
personnel implications, and successful implementation depends upon each
functional area acting in concert.
A checklist of issues is a useful and common approach to carrying out a
marketing audit (Wilson 1982) (Table 17.2 is a checklist for external marketing
and Table 17.3 for internal marketing). But in compiling a comprehensive list
that can be applied universally, marketers should recognize a firm’s operating
context should be factored in to an audit if the results are to deliver
performance improvements (Wu et al. 2015). Figure 17.2 shows an overviewof influences, position of and relationship between the influencing factors on
the marketing audit and performance.

Overview of influencing factors, marketing audit and performance
Source: based on Wu et al. (2015)
External and internal factorsExternal
The external (macroenvironment) climate can affect the marketing audit, and
business and marketing performance. Environmental dynamism (e.g. rate of
technology change, cultural shifts affecting society, predictability of
competition, global political events) is impacting on market planning in
sometimes dramatic and unexpected ways. For example, Covid-19, Brexit and
the conflict in Ukraine are major events that have brought about a climate of
instability and change, resulting in high inflation, supply shortages and a cost
of living crisis. Prior to this there had been a period of greater stability and
certainty, with over a decade of very low interest and inflation rates. The
importance of analysing environmental climate and dynamism lies in identify
emerging trends that have implications for exploitable opportunities and the
extent of turbulence in any given market (Wu et al. 2015). The better the
climate the greater the growth opportunities; conversely, in difficult and
turbulent climates, competition intensifies and profit margins are reduced
(Dickinson and Ramaseshan 2004). Business strategy influences the marketing
audit, providing strategic direction, and sets the context for the marketing
audit.
External factors are political/legal, economic, ecological/physical,
social/cultural and technological forces. The auditing of these issues is known
by the acronym PEEST analysis. Originally, Francis J. Aguilar alerted
managers to the importance of scanning the business environment, and he is
credited with inventing the acronym PEST, a structured method of analysis
that assisted an organization’s future planning (Aguilar 1967). Since then,
various acronyms have been used in management literature, such as STEP,
STEEP and PESTLE (Gillespie 2007). The key point to remember is that
scanning the business environment in a systematic manner is crucially
important for all organizations, as changes in the environment can have
dramatic effects on long-term success. Table 17.2 lists the external factors and
key topics for each area. Chapters 2 and 3 explore the marketing environment
in depth.
Internal
Internal (microenvironment) factors include the actors in the firm’s
immediate environment that affect its capability to operate effectively in its
chosen markets. The key actors are customers, distributors, suppliers and
competitors, and microenvironmental analysis will consist of an analysis ofpage 690
page 691
issues relating to these actors, and an overall analysis of market size,
growth rates and trends (see Table 17.2). Broadly,
microenvironmental analysis consists of:
customer analysis of buyer behaviour – how customers rate competitive
offerings, and how they segment
competitor analysis, which examines the nature of actual and potential
competitors, and their objectives and strategies. It also seeks to identify their
strengths and weaknesses, size, market share and profitability. Finally, entry
barrier analysis identifies the key financial and non-financial barriers that
protect the industry from competitor attack
distribution analysis, which covers an examination of the attractiveness of
different distribution channels, distributors, buyer behaviour, the strengths
and weaknesses of different distribution channels, movements in power
bases, and alternative methods of physical distribution
supplier analysis, which examines who suppliers are and where they are
located, their strengths and weaknesses, power changes and trends in the
supply chain.
The internal audit allows the performance and activities of the business to
be assessed in the light of environmental developments. Operating results form
a basis of assessment, through analysis of sales, market share, profit margins
and costs. Strategic issues analysis examines the suitability of marketing
objectives and segmentation bases in the light of changes in the marketplace.
Competitive advantages and the core competencies on which they are based
would be reassessed and the positioning of products in the market critically
reviewed. Core competencies are the principal distinctive capabilities
possessed by a firm, which define what it really is good at (e.g. leadership,
technological innovation and design, creativity, superior management skills).
An example of a firm that has invested in its core competencies is Zara,
which has utilized its supply-side competencies to build a global fashion
brand. VW’s core competencies include innovation and creativity, which
reinforce its brand image as a core business asset. When firms conduct a
market audit and identify opportunities, they should ensure alignment with
core competencies and the opportunity. Amazon’s move on to the high streets
with its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go stores may seem risky, as the globalpage 692
retailer has built its success online, but the brand’s core competencies (e.g.
omnichannel management, management vision of the future of retail), plus
extensive financial, logistics and infrastructure resources, are likely to ensure
success (Ritson 2021) (see Exhibit 17.2).

The marketing structure on which marketing activities are based should
be analysed. Marketing structure consists of the marketing organization,
training, and intra- and interdepartmental communication that takes place
within an organization. Marketing organization is reviewed to determine fit
with strategy and the market, and marketing training requirements are
examined. Finally, communications and the relationship within the marketing
department, and between marketing and other functions (e.g. R&D,
engineering, production), need to be appraised.
Marketing information systems are audited for effectiveness. These
marketing systems consist of the marketing information, planning and control
systems that support marketing activities. Shortfalls in information provision
are analysed, the marketing planning system is critically appraised for cost￾effectiveness, and the marketing control system is assessed in the
light of accuracy, timeliness (does it provide evaluations when
managers require them?) and coverage (does the system evaluate the key
variables affecting firm performance?).
Marketing systems can be vital assets. For example, marketing
information systems at British Airways, Qantas and Singapore Airlines providepage 693
knowledge regarding repeat passengers’ preferred seats, newspapers, food and
drinks, allowing customization of their offerings.
Marketing function audit (e.g. promotional effectiveness, sales force
capacity to achieve business objectives, pricing objectives, strategies and
product portfolios) should be analysed to determine future strategic
objectives, service mix elements, performance and objectives. Each element of
the marketing mix is reviewed in the light of changing customer requirements
and competitor activity. Table 17.3 lists the internal factors.
Marketing performance
Marketing performance is the third key area of interest when conducting a
marketing audit. Those firms that have an established marketing audit
methodology are found to outperform those that do not (Brownlie 1996; Wu et
al. 2015; Morgan et al. 2022). There are many considerations when auditing
performance; these can broadly be classified as financial–which includes
market share, sales and profitability–and non-financial–which includes
customer satisfaction, competitive advantage and innovation (see Table 17.4).

The marketing audit provides a basis for reviewing a firm’s past
performance against its future potential using topics in the checklist. However,
to give the same amount of attention and detailed analysis to every item wouldcause the audit to grind to a halt under a mass of data and issues. In practice,
the audit is critical in deciding the key items to focus upon. Those factors that
are considered of crucial importance to the firm’s performance will merit most
attention. For small businesses, setting priorities and carrying out the audit can
have added challenges, as owners/managers can be overstretched and time￾poor, and find it difficult to critique their own strengths and weaknesses. One
by-product of the marketing audit may be a realization that information about
key environmental issues is lacking.
The marketing audit should be an ongoing activity, not a desperate attempt
to turn around an ailing business. Some firms conduct audits each year as part
of their annual planning system; those operating in less turbulent
environmental climates may consider every two or three years to be adequate.
Others might consider the use of an outside consultant to coordinate activities
and provide an objective outside view to be beneficial, while some may
believe their own managers are best equipped to conduct the analyses. Clearly,
there is no set formula for deciding when and by whom the audit is conducted.
The decision ultimately rests on the preferences and situation facing the
management team.
SWOT analysis
A SWOT analysis is a structured approach to evaluating the strategic position
of a business by identifying its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats. It provides a simple method of synthesizing the results of the
marketing audit (Piercy and Giles 1989). Internal strengths and weaknesses are
summarized as they relate to external opportunities and threats (see Figure
17.3), and strategies can be based on a good fit. But the results of a SWOT
analysis should also fit in to the business context set out by the mission
statement, link to the marketing environment and fit with organizational
resources (Agarwal et al. 2012).
FIGURE 17.3
SWOT analysispage 694
When evaluating strengths and weaknesses, only those resources or
capabilities that would be valued by the customer should be included (Piercy
2008). Strengths such as ‘We are an old established firm’, ‘We are a large
supplier’ and ‘We are technologically advanced’ should be questioned for their
impact on customer satisfaction. It is conceivable that such bland
generalizations confer as many weaknesses as strengths. Also, opportunities
and threats should be listed as anticipated events or trends outside the business
that have implications for performance. Once a simple SWOT analysis has
been completed, thought can be given to how to turn weaknesses into strengths
and threats into opportunities. For example, a perceived weakness in customer
care might suggest the need for staff training to create a new strength. A threat
posed by a new entrant might call for a strategic alliance to combine the
strengths of both parties to exploit a new opportunity. Because these activities
are designed to convert weaknesses into strengths and threats into
opportunities, they are called conversion strategies (see Figure 17.4). Another
way to use a SWOT analysis is to match strengths with opportunities. An
example of a firm that has successfully matched strengths with opportunities is
Charles Tyrwhitt, the men’s clothing retailer, whose founder Nick Wheeler saw
an opportunity in the growing demand for online sales. One of the firm’s
strengths was experience running its own catalogue business for
more than a decade to service its existing home-shopping
operation. The result is Charles Tyrwhitt has remained in business through
difficult trading periods and created a highly profitable online business,
outselling its rivals online.
FIGURE 17.4SWOT analysis and strategy development
SWOT analysis is a strategic management tool generally applied when a
firm is looking to improve or develop a part of its business, but the simplicity
of the matrix belies the complexity involved in making the output of the
SWOT analysis useful. According to Pandya (2017), ‘Most SWOT exercises
end up being laundry lists of bullet points put together under each of the four
headings.’ Pandya suggests that to gain value out of a SWOT analysis, firms
should take a fresh look and use additional lenses to determine the outcomes of
their analysis, by finding ways to:
create a fit between strengths and opportunities to leverage advantages and
seize opportunities
reduce vulnerability by improving weaknesses, and ensuring acute and
current awareness of threats.
Remember, SWOT is a means of developing structured guidelines for
managerial actions; it does not provide strategic direction (Pandya 2017).
Marketing Objectives
The results of the marketing audit and SWOT analysis lead to the definition of
marketing objectives. These objectives also link through the business missionto corporate objectives. Imagine you are responsible for managing Danone’s
yoghurt portfolio, which includes the Activia, Shape and Actimel product
ranges. The corporate objective is to remain number one in the yoghurt
markets, staying ahead of Yakult, Chobani (US brand) and Nestlé. You will
need to develop a marketing plan that contributes to this corporate objective.
How you do this involves deciding on which markets to target with which
products and then setting specific objectives for individual products. There are
two levels of objective used in marketing planning:
1. First is strategic thrust objectives. These shape the direction of the plan and
involve deciding which markets to target and which products/services to
sell. So, in the Danone case, you might decide to target new customers
(yoghurt eaters of competing brands) with existing products (Activia fruit
yoghurts).
2. Second is strategic objectives. These set specific objectives for individual
products. So, to implement your plan, you will need to build market share
(of Activia fruit yoghurts).
We will now discuss these types of objective in more detail.
Strategic thrust objectives
Objectives should be set in terms of which products to sell in which markets
(McDonald 2007). This describes the strategic thrust of the business. The
strategic thrust defines the future direction and areas of potential growth for a
business. The alternatives (see Figure 17.5) comprise:
existing products in existing markets (market penetration or expansion)
new/related products for existing markets (product development)
existing products in new/related markets (market development)
new/related products for new/related markets (entry into new markets).
FIGURE 17.5
Strategic thrust alternativespage 695
Market penetration
This strategy is to take the existing product in the existing market and to
attempt increased penetration. Existing customers may become more brand
loyal (brand-switch less often) and/or new customers in the same market may
begin to buy the brand. Other tactics to increase penetration include
getting existing customers to use the brand more often (e.g. wash
their hair more frequently) and to use a greater quantity on each use occasion.
This tactic would also have the effect of expanding the market. For example,
Glasses Direct, the online reseller of spectacles and sunglasses, launched a
two-for-one offer, encouraging existing customers to buy several pairs of
glasses at a time (Glasses Direct n.d.). It also uses incentives to encourage
existing customers to introduce their friends, and seeks to encourage new
customers in the same market to switch to its brand (see Exhibit 17.3).
EXHIBIT 17.3
Glasses Direct: ‘share with a friend’Source: Glasses Direct
Product development
This strategy involves increasing sales by improving present products or
developing new products for current markets. New product replacements that
fail to provide additional benefits are unlikely to succeed. Google Glass, smart
glasses that linked to the internet and allowed wearers to take photos and
videos, were withdrawn as usability, privacy and safety issues created
problems for the product’s early adopters (Cellan-Jones 2015). Product
development may take the form of brand extensions (Cadbury’s Dairy Milk
Caramel bars and Caramel Nibbles, Cadbury’s Crunchie bars and Crunchie
Rocks) provide slightly modified features for target customers. Competing
sportswear brands Nike, Adidas and Puma regularly introduce new product
designs to their footwear and clothing ranges but also look to find emerging
trends where they can supply new products, for example the sports jacket
market is seeing significant growth and all three competitors are vying formarket share with new products. Valeo Foods Group owns many leading
brands (e.g. Rowse honey, Kettle crisps and Jacob’s biscuits) and recently
acquired It’s All Good Foods (IAG) to add Manomasa premium tortilla chips
to its product portfolio. This product has been reformulated to bring tortilla
chips back to the tables of existing snack eaters (Valeo Foods 2020). Read
Mini Case 17.1 to find out more about how jewellery maker Pandora has used
its products to develop markets.
MINI CASE 17.1
Pandora: Wherever Life Takes You, Take it With You
Pandora developed its markets from a single store in Copenhagen, Denmark, into the
world’s largest international jewellery brand, with more than 2,400 retail stores around the
globe. Having established a manufacturing base in Thailand, Per and Winnie Enevoldsen –
who founded the firm – concentrated on building their business through wholesale jewellery
markets. On the supply side, they focused on manufacturing products and introduced the
Pandora charm bracelet into Denmark, where it was a great success, and then moved on to
Germany, Austria and the US. The innovativeness of the product, positioned at affordable
prices, enabled Pandora to develop these markets quickly. More factories were opened in
Thailand, and a vertically integrated system – in-house designers, the firm’s own factories
and retail stores and franchises – was used to service the increased demand. The
manufacturing resources and capabilities facilitate agile manufacturing, so enabling rapid
response to changes in market demands and capacity to capitalize on new opportunities.
On the demand side, much attention has been given to the customer journey and ensuring
this is a seamless experience across multiple channels (in-store, online and mobile) and
communication platforms (broadcast, print, web, social media).
The firm continued to use its products to reinforce the brand’s market position. Its ‘Wherever
life takes you, take it with you’ campaign aimed to encourage loyalty from existing
customers, who were targeted to build up their collection of Pandora products as keepsakes
of the special moments in their lives.

The firm’s mission is ‘to inspire every woman to feel creative in her self-expression’, which
ties in to the future vision, which is to be the branded manufacturer that delivers the most
personal jewellery experience.
The strategic marketing plan involves continuing to position the brand as affordable,
innovative jewellery. New products are continually added in the form of charms, bracelets
and necklaces, but Pandora aims to develop the product portfolio beyond bracelets and
charms into rings, earrings and necklaces by adding culturally relevant and seasonal
ranges.
Questions:
1. Draw up a SWOT analysis for Pandora.
2. Suggest what Pandora should do in order to create a fit between strengths and
opportunities, and to reduce any vulnerabilities (weaknesses and threats).
3. Propose marketing objectives for products and markets that might enable Pandora to
achieve its strategic aim of delivering the most personal jewellery experience.
Based on: West (2014); Pandora Group (2022a, 2022b, 2022c)
Market development
This strategy is used when current products are sold in new markets. This may
involve moving into new geographical markets. Many consumer durable
brands, such as cars, consumer electronics and household appliance brands, are
sold in overseas markets with no or only very minor modifications to those
sold at home. An alternative market development strategy is to move into new
market segments. For example, Santander, one of the world’s largest banking
groups, has also developed markets for its existing financial products in both
Latin America and the UK (Economist 2010).
Entry into new markets
Developing new products for new markets is the riskiest strategy, but may be
necessary when a firm’s current products and markets offer few prospects for
future growth. When there is synergy between existing and new products, this
strategy is more likely to work. For example, Apple’s experience and
competencies in computer electronics provided the platform for designing apage 697
new product, the Apple Watch, targeting a different market: people who
wanted to move away from being tied to their mobile phones (new market with
radical new product). Firms in technology markets are constantly investing in
new developments and looking for markets for their offers.
Strategic objectives
Alongside objectives for product/market direction, strategic objectives for
each product need to be agreed. Simply, this begins the process of planning at
the product level. There are four basic options:
1. build
2. hold
3. harvest
4. divest.
For new products, the strategic objective will inevitably be to build sales
and market share. For existing products, the appropriate strategic objective will
depend on the particular situation associated with the product. This will be
determined in the marketing audit, SWOT analysis and evaluation of the
strategic options outlined earlier. The important point to remember at this stage
is that building sales and market share is not the only sensible strategic
objective for a product. As we shall see, holding sales and market share may
make commercial sense under certain conditions; harvesting, where sales and
market share can fall but profit margins are maximized, may also
be preferable to building; and finally, divestment, where the
product is dropped or sold, can be the logical outcome of the situation analysis.
Together, strategic thrust and strategic objectives define where the business
and its products intend to go in the future.
Core Marketing Strategy
Once objectives have been set, the next stage in the plan involves deciding
how to meet the objectives and answering the question ‘How do we get there?’
The core marketing strategy focuses on how objectives can be accomplished.
There are three key elements to consider: target markets, competitor targets
and establishing a competitive advantage. These elements are interlinked andtogether form the key aspects of competitive positioning (Hooley et al. 2012).
We will consider each of the three elements in turn.
Target markets
A central plank of core strategy is the choice of target market (or markets).
Marketing is not about chasing any customer at any price. Decisions should be
taken about which groups of customers (segments) are most attractive to the
business and best fit with its capabilities. Business publication The Economist
targets business professionals and students who wish to be regarded as well
informed about business matters. This periodical can ‘offer authoritative
insight and opinion on international news, politics, business, finance, science
and technology’. It can achieve high standards of journalism across a wide
range of subjects, as it attracts many writers who wish to work together to
produce thought-provoking articles. This clear target market linked with the
firms, capabilities and resources enables the production of a product that
satisfies the needs of its customers.
The choice of target market can emerge from the SWOT analysis and the
setting of marketing objectives (strategic thrust). For existing products,
marketing management should consider its current target markets and their
changing needs. Consequently, a firm should focus on customers’ needs across
its established product ranges. For example, smart televisions are constantly
evolving in response to technology innovations and changing customer needs,
so to retain its market share Samsung should make changes to its marketing
mix to adapt to new requirements. In other cases, current target markets may
have decreased in attractiveness, so products will need to be repositioned to
target different market segments. The process of market segmentation and
targeting is examined in depth in Chapter 7. See Marketing in Action 17.1 for a
discussion of how leading European frozen foods brand Birds Eye adapted its
target marketing strategy.
MARKETING IN ACTION 17.1
Birds Eye Looks Closely at Its Target Marketing
StrategyFrozen food manufacturer Birds Eye invests heavily in getting its products to the right
markets. Recently, the brand has enjoyed a period of growth as pandemic lockdowns
attracted existing and new customers to buy more frozen food. Previously, however, the
brand had suffered a decline and so invested heavily in marketing campaigns to reconnect
with its target markets. In 2017–18 a new marketing strategy aiming to double its market
share in Europe by 2020 cost £16 million (almost €19 million), while a rebranding campaign
cost a further £8 million (€9.5 million). Arguably, the reasoning driving these investments
was to reduce missed opportunities: when the brand assessed its marketing situation (in the
UK market), it found that, while more than 80 per cent of households were aware of and
used the brand, only 2 per cent used it at all mealtimes. In fact, its analysis revealed many
customers perceived Birds Eye as just a ‘teatime fish fingers and peas brand’. This was
also a cause for concern, as adults represented 65 per cent of customers, but fish fingers
were perceived as food for ‘kids’.

The marketing strategy across Europe used a marketing communications campaign
designed to reposition the brand in the minds of its customers. The aim was to get existing
customers to consider the brand as a ‘food’ rather than a frozen alternative, and to
penetrate the large market of customers who trust the brand in both the UK and the rest of
Europe, by encouraging them to change the way they use Birds Eye products.
The brand’s communication strategy focused on winning battles. Six areas were identified:
fish fingers, coated fish, chicken dippers, grills, peas and Inspirations, and marketing
campaigns were devised to reposition these foods, making them more attractive and
authentic, and in doing so overcoming target market consumers’ barriers to consumption.
For example, ‘With love from Birds Eye’ celebrated generations of farmers growing peas
and the benefits for the customer: lots of natural goodness in the product.
Campaigns used additional channels, such as video on demand and social media
advertising, to reach target customers. Even Captain Birds Eye had a makeover, returning
to a more rugged look to bring a more authentic appearance to the brand icon. The frozen
food manufacturer relaunched 57 of its products, with a new slogan: ‘The Birds Eye
difference’. The firm tied up sponsorship deals with mainstream TV channels to get access
to its core target market – families with children – when they are eating their evening meals.
The deal involved scheduling the advertising campaign during popular TV show The
Simpsons.page 698
The outcome of the 2018 campaign was strong growth and increased market share, but
then there was an unprecedented spurt in demand for frozen food, which allowed the firm to
meet its 2020 targets ahead of time: during the pandemic, consumers turned to
convenience prepared foods as restaurants and fast-food outlets were closed by
lockdowns. To capitalize on this boost in demand, Birds Eye launched the ‘What’s for tea’
campaign, featuring consumers living their lives in lockdown. The brand message tone was
just right for target market and the advert was created entirely remotely with marketing
teams working across Europe.
Post-pandemic, Birds Eye continues to focus on target markets, developing products for
existing and new markets, such as its gluten-free ranges, sweet potato waffles, katsu curry
sauce, fish finger burritos and pease buddha bowl.
It recently launched #PeasForBees, a campaign aiming to promote biodiversity and the
importance of sustainable food production, again focusing on the wider needs of its target
customers.

Competitor targets
Competitor targets are the organizations against which a firm chooses to
compete directly. For example, BMW competes directly with Mercedes-Benz,
Nissan, Honda and Audi in the quality car market, while Tesla has found its
competition with Ford Motor Company in the electric vehicle (EV) market.
While these are strong competing brands with huge resources, weak
competitors may be viewed as easy prey and resources channelled to attack
them. The importance of understanding competitors, and strategies for
attacking and defending against competitors are discussed in Chapter 18,
which examines in detail the areas of competitor analysis and competitive
strategy.
Competitive advantage
The link between target markets and competitor targets is the establishment of
a competitive advantage. A competitive advantage is the achievement of
superior performance through differentiation to provide superior customer
value, or by managing to achieve lowest delivered cost. For major success,
businesses need to achieve a clear performance differential over the
competition on factors that are important to target customers. The mostpage 699
successful methods are built upon some combination of three advantages (Day
1984):
1. Being better – providing superior quality or service (e.g. Netflix, UPS, Visa,
Starbucks, Singapore Airlines).
2. Being faster – anticipating or responding to customer needs faster than the
competition (e.g. Zara).
3. Being closer – establishing close long-term relationships with customers
(e.g. Amazon, Microsoft, LEGO).
Another route to competitive advantage is achieving the lowest relative
cost position of all competitors (Porter 1980). Lowest cost can be translated
into a competitive advantage through low prices or by producing standard
items at price parity when comparative success may be achieved through
higher profit margins than those of competitors. Achieving a
highly differentiated product is not incompatible with a low-cost
position, however (Phillips et al. 1983). Since high-quality products suffer
lower rejection rates through quality control and lower repair costs through
their warranty period, they may incur lower total costs than their inferior
rivals. Methods of achieving competitive advantages and their sources are
analysed in Chapter 18.
Tests of an effective core strategy
Figure 17.6 shows six key considerations that can be used to test a core
strategy. The six considerations are that the strategy should:
1. be based upon a clear definition of target customers and their needs
2. show understanding of competitors and be able to create competitive
advantage
3. incur acceptable risk; challenging a strong competitor with a weak
competitive advantage and a low resource base would not incur acceptable
risk
4. be resourced and managerially supportable; the strategy should match the
resources, capabilities and managerial competencies of the business
5. be derived from the product and marketing objectives established as part of
the planning process; extensive use of promotions that makes commerciallogic when following a build objective may make no sense when following
a harvesting objective
6. be internally consistent; each of the elements of the core strategy should be
consistent with the rest of the marketing plan.
FIGURE 17.6
Testing core strategy
Marketing mix decisions
At this stage in the planning process, managers consider the marketing mix.
The tools they use and the choices they make will be informed by the core
strategy. Decisions about use of each of the elements of the mix will vary
depending on whether the focus is on a product or service. Nevertheless,
decisions will consist of judgements about how to select and blend each of the
relevant elements of the mix. Such decisions will not be taken in isolation, as
marketing managers will also consider how their close competitors use the
mix. For example, major supermarkets Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and
Tesco constantly vie for market share. As there is limited growth in the overall
size of the grocery market, so each of these major players grows its share of
the market by attracting its competitors’ customers. This is achieved through
the marketing mix, and each of these supermarket brands uses the mix
differently. At a basic level, Asda creates its competitive advantage by focusingpage 700
on keeping prices very low. Sainsbury’s creates competitive advantage through
the quality of its products. Morrisons differentiates itself through the freshness
of its products and its store destinations, and Tesco positions its brand on
offering the greatest value across the widest product range.
As with all other stages of the marketing plan, there are many complex
choices involved in selecting an effective marketing mix. This book devotes
several chapters to exploring each of the elements of the mix in detail: product
(Chapters 8, 9 and 19), services (Chapter 11), price (Chapter 9), promotion
(Chapters 12, 13, 14, 15) and place (Chapter 16).
Organization and implementation
No marketing plan will succeed unless it ‘degenerates into work’ (Drucker
1993). Consequently, the business must design an organization that has the
capability of implementing the plan. Indeed, organizational weaknesses
discovered as part of the SWOT analysis may restrict the feasible range of
strategic options. Reorganization could mean the establishment of a new
marketing organization or department in the business. In the past, many
manufacturing organizations did not have a marketing department (Piercy
1986). In some cases, marketing was done by the chief executive, or the sales
department dealt with customer enquiries, so there was no further need for
other marketing input. In other situations, environmental change caused
strategy change and subsequent reorganization of marketing and sales business
functions. More recently, the growth of large corporate customers with
enormous buying power has resulted in businesses focusing their resources
more firmly on meeting their needs (strategy change), which in turn has led to
dedicated marketing and sales teams being organized to service these accounts
(reorganization). Implementation and organizational issues are explored in
Chapter 21.
Because strategy changes and reorganization affect the balance of power in
businesses and the daily life and workloads of people, resistance may occur.
Consequently, marketing personnel need to understand the barriers to change,
the process of change management and the techniques of persuasion that canbe used to effect the implementation of the marketing plan. These issues are
dealt with in Chapter 21.
Control
The final stage in the marketing planning process is control. The aim of
control systems is to evaluate the results of the marketing plan so that
corrective action can be taken if performance does not match objectives. Short￾term control systems can plot results against objectives on a weekly, monthly,
quarterly and/or annual basis. Measures include sales, profits, costs and cash
flow. There is a growing need for marketing managers to assess the pay-off
from their investments and justify them. This has resulted in the use of
marketing metrics, which are quantitative measures of the outcomes of
marketing activities and expenditures. There is coverage of marketing metrics
in Chapter 21. Strategic control systems are more long term. Managers need to
stand back from week-by-week and month-by-month results to reassess
critically whether their plans are in line with their capabilities and the
environment.
Lack of this long-term control perspective may result in the pursuit of
plans that have lost strategic credibility. New competition, changes in
technology and moving customer requirements may have rendered old plans
obsolete. This, of course, returns the planning process to the beginning, since
this kind of fundamental review is conducted in the marketing audit. It is the
activity of assessing internal capabilities and external opportunities and threats
that results in a SWOT analysis. This outcome may be a redefinition of the
business mission and, as we have seen, changes in marketing objectives and
strategies to realign the business with its environment.
So how do the stages of marketing planning relate to the fundamental
planning questions stated earlier in this chapter? Table 17.1 illustrates this
relationship. The question ‘Where are we now?’ is answered by the business
mission definition, the marketing audit and SWOT analysis.
Rewards of Marketing Planning
Many authors have suggested there is a positive relationship between market￾orientated business and performance (Jaworski and Kohli 1993; Kumar et al.page 701
1998; Narver and Slater 1998), and firms with a highly developed market
orientation tend to derive greater benefits from marketing planning (Pulendran
et al. 2003; Wu et al. 2015). Moreover, various authors have attributed the
following benefits to marketing planning (Greenley 1986; Leppard and
McDonald 1991):
1. Consistency – the plan provides a focal point for decisions and actions. By
reference to a common plan, management decisions should be more
consistent and actions better coordinated.
2. Encourages the monitoring of change – the planning process forces
managers to step away from day-to-day problems and review the impact of
change on the business from a strategic perspective.
3. Encourages organizational adaptation – the underlying premise of
planning is that the organization should adapt to match its
environment; marketing planning, therefore, promotes the necessity to
accept the inevitability of change. This is important, as the capability to
adapt has been linked to superior performance (Oktemgil and Greenley
1997).
4. Stimulates achievement – the planning process focuses on objectives,
strategies and results. It encourages people to ask, ‘What can we achieve
given our capabilities?’As such, it motivates people to set new horizons for
objectives when they otherwise might be content to accept much lower
standards of performance.
5. Resource allocation – the planning process asks fundamental questions
about resource allocation, for example which products should receive high
investment (build), which should be maintained (hold), which should have
resources withdrawn slowly (harvest) and which should have resources
withdrawn immediately (divest).
6. Competitive advantage – planning promotes the search for sources of
competitive advantage.
Strategic marketing planning – if implemented effectively – can deliver
positive results (Lee et al. 2013), but it is important to recognize that often
marketing plans are unstructured, complex and have many variables to
consider. Conducting a marketing audit may not contain all the required
information and important decisions may be taken that are only partially
informed. Marketing managers need to overcome implementation barriers if
their strategies are to succeed.At a more tactical level, incremental planning is more problem-focused in
that the process begins with the realization of a problem (for example, a fall￾off in orders) and continues with an attempt to identify a solution. As solutions
to problems form, so strategy emerges. However, little attempt is made to
consciously integrate the individual decisions that could possibly affect one
another. Strategy is viewed as a loosely linked group of decisions that are
handled individually. Nevertheless, the effect of incremental planning may be
to attune the business to its environment, through its problem-solving nature.
The drawback of incremental planning is the lack of a broad situation analysis
and strategy option generation, which renders the incremental approach less
comprehensive. For some companies, however, its inherent practicality may
support its use, rather than its rationality (O’Shaughnessy 1995).
Problems in Making Planning Work
Empirical work on marketing planning practices found firms did not practise
the kinds of systematic planning procedures described in this chapter and, of
those that did, many did not enjoy the rewards described in the previous
section (Greenley 1987). However, others have shown there is a relationship
between planning and commercial success – see, for example, Armstrong
(1982) and McDonald (1984) – the problem being that contextual difficulties
associated with the process of marketing planning are substantial and need to
be understood.
Political
Marketing planning is a resource allocation process. The outcome of the
process is an allocation of more funds to some products and departments, and
the same or less to others. Since power bases, career opportunities and salaries
are often tied to whether an area is fast or slow growing, it is not surprising
managers view planning as a highly political activity. One example is a
European bank, whose planning process resulted in the decision to insist its
retail branch managers divert certain types of loan application to the
industrial/merchant banking arm of the group, where the return was greater.
This was required because the plan was designed to optimize the return to the
group. However, the consequence was considerable friction between thepage 702
divisions concerned, because the decision lowered the performance of the
retail branches. In another European bank, the introduction of a series of
market-based products was blocked by managers of existing product￾orientated offerings, who feared the launch would lead to them losing their
jobs. These examples demonstrate how political factors can be a barrier to
marketing planning initiatives.
Opportunity cost
Some busy managers view marketing planning as a time-wasting ritual that
conflicts with the need to deal with day-to-day problems. They view the
opportunity cost of spending two or three days away at a hotel thrashing out
long-term plans as too high. This difficulty may be compounded by the fact
that people who are attracted to the hectic pace of managerial life may be of
the type who prefer to live that way (Mintzberg 1975) and hence may be ill at
ease with the thought of a long period of sedate contemplation.
Reward systems
The reward systems of many businesses are geared to the short term.
Incentives and bonuses may be linked to quarterly or annual results. Managers
may thus overweigh short-term issues and underweigh medium- and long-term
concerns if there is a conflict of time. Thus, marketing planning may be
viewed as of secondary importance.
Information
To function effectively, a systematic marketing planning system needs
informational inputs. Market share, size and growth rates are basic inputs into
the marketing audit but may be unavailable. More perversely, information may
be wilfully withheld by vested interests who, recognizing that knowledge is
power, distort the true situation to protect their position in the planning
process.
CultureThe establishment of a systematic marketing planning process may be at
variance with the culture of the organization. As has already been stated,
businesses may ‘plan’ by making incremental decisions. Hence, the strategic
planning system may challenge the status quo and be a threat. In other cases,
the values and beliefs of some managers may be hostile to a planning system
altogether.
Personalities
Marketing planning usually involves a discussion between managers about the
strategic choices facing the business and the likely outcomes. This can be a
highly charged affair where personality clashes and pent-up antagonisms can
surface. The result can be that the process degenerates into abusive argument
and sets up deep chasms within the management team.
Lack of knowledge and skills
Another problem that can arise when setting up a marketing planning system is
that the management team do not have the knowledge and skills to perform the
tasks adequately (McDonald 1989). Basic marketing knowledge about market
segmentation, competitive advantage and the nature of strategic objectives
may be lacking. Similarly, skills in analysing competitive situations and
defining core strategies may be inadequate.
How to Handle Marketing Planning
Problems
Some of the problems revealed during the market planning process may be
deep-seated managerial inadequacies rather than being intrinsic to the planning
process itself. As such, the attempt to establish the planning system may be
seen as a benefit to the business by revealing the nature of these problems.
However, various authors have proposed recommendations for minimizing the
impact of such problems (Abell and Hammond 1979; McDonald 1984):
Senior management support – top management must be committed to
planning and be seen by middle management to give it total support. This
should be ongoing support, not a short-term fad.page 703
Match the planning system to the culture of the business – how the
marketing planning process is managed should be consistent with the culture
of the organization. For example, in some organizations, the top￾down/bottom-up balance will move towards top-down; in other less
directive cultures, the balance will move towards a more bottom-up
planning style.
The reward system – this should reward the achievement of longer-term
objectives rather than focus exclusively on short-term results.
Depoliticize outcomes – less emphasis should be placed on rewarding
managers associated with build (growth) strategies. There should be
recognition of the skills involved in defending share and harvesting
products. At General Electric, for instance, managers are classified as
‘growers’, ‘caretakers’ and ‘undertakers’, and matched to products that are
being built, defended or harvested, in recognition of the fact that the skills
involved differ according to the strategic objective. No stigma is attached to
caretaking or undertaking; each role is acknowledged as contributing to the
success of the organization.
Clear communication – plans should be communicated to those charged
with implementation.
Training – marketing personnel should be trained in the necessary marketing
knowledge and skills to perform the planning job. Ideally, all members of
the management team should attend the same training course, so that they
share a common understanding of the concepts and tools involved, and can
communicate using the same terminology.
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapter Detailed Review
1. The role of marketing planning within business
Marketing planning is part of a broader concept known as strategic planning.
For one-product companies, the role of marketing planning is to ensure the
product continues to meet customers’ needs as well as seeking new opportunities.
For companies marketing a range of products in a number of markets, marketing
planning’s role is as above plus the allocation of resources to each product.
For companies comprising a number of businesses (strategic business units,
SBUs), marketing planning’s role is as above plus a contribution to the allocation
of resources to each business.page 704
2. The key planning questions
These are: ‘Where are we now?’, ‘How did we get there?’, ‘Where are we
heading?’, ‘Where would we like to be?’, ‘How do we get there?’ and ‘Are we on
course?’
3. The process of marketing planning
The steps in the process are: deciding the business mission,
conducting a marketing audit, producing a SWOT analysis, setting marketing
objectives (strategic thrust and strategic objectives), deciding core strategy (target
markets, competitive advantage and competitor targets), making marketing mix
decisions, organizing and implementing, and control.
4. The concept of the business mission
A business mission is a broadly defined, enduring statement of purpose that
distinguishes a business from others of its type.
A business mission should answer two questions: ‘What business are we in?’ and
‘What business do we want to be in?’
5. The nature of the marketing audit and SWOT analysis
The marketing audit is a systematic examination of a business’s marketing
environment, objectives, strategies and activities, with a view to identifying key
strategic issues, problem areas and opportunities.
The marketing audit consists of an examination of a firm’s external and internal
environments. The external environment is made up of the macroenvironment, the
market and competition. The internal environmental audit consists of operating
results, strategic issues analysis, marketing mix effectiveness, marketing
structures and systems.
A SWOT analysis provides a simple method of summarizing the results of the
marketing audit.
Internal issues are summarized under strengths and weaknesses, and external
issues are summarized under opportunities and threats.
6. The nature of marketing objectives
There are two types of marketing objective: strategic thrust, which defines the
future direction of the business in terms of which products to sell in which markets;
and strategic objectives, which are product-level objectives relating to the decision
to build, hold, harvest or divest products.
7. The components of core strategy and the criteria for testing its effectiveness
The components of core strategy are target markets, competitor targets and
competitive advantage.
The criteria for testing its effectiveness are that core strategy clearly defines target
customers and their needs, creates a competitive advantage, incurs acceptable
risk, is resource and managerially supportable, is derived to achieve product–
market objectives and is internally consistent. All elements are interlinked, and
together they form the core aspects of competitive positioning.
8. Where marketing mix decisions are placed within the marketing planning
processpage 705
Marketing mix decisions follow those of core strategy, as they are based on an
understanding of target customers’ needs and the competition, so that a
competitive advantage can be created.
9. The importance of organization, implementation and control within the
marketing planning process
Organization is needed to support the strategies decided upon. Strategies are
unlikely to be effective without attention to implementation issues. For example,
techniques to overcome resistance to change and the training of staff who are
required to implement strategic decisions are likely to be required.
Control systems are important, so that the results of the marketing plan can be
evaluated and corrective action taken if performance does not match objectives.
10. The rewards and problems associated with marketing planning
The rewards are consistency of decision-making, encouragement of the
monitoring of change, encouragement of organizational adaptation, stimulation of
achievement, aiding resource allocation, and promotion of the creation of a
competitive advantage.
The potential problems with marketing planning revolve around the context in
which it takes place; they are political, high opportunity cost, lack of reward
systems tied to longer-term results, lack of relevant information, cultural and
personality clashes, and lack of managerial knowledge and skills.
11. Recommendations for overcoming marketing planning problems
Recommendations for minimizing the impact of marketing planning
problems are attaining senior management support, matching the planning system
to the culture of the business, creating a reward system that is focused on longer￾term performance, depoliticizing outcomes, communicating clearly to those
responsible for implementation, and training in the necessary marketing
knowledge and skills to conduct marketing planning.

MARKS & SPENCER:
REVIVING A BRITISH ICON
Introduction
Marks & Spencer (M&S) was founded in 1884 when Michael Marks, a Polish refugee, opened a
market stall in Leeds. In 1894, Marks went into partnership with Thomas Spencer, a former
cashier from wholesale company Dewhirst, and in 1904 Marks & Spencer opened its first shop,
selling a range of general goods (Marks & Spencer 2022). Over more than 100 years, the M&S
name has grown and evolved, with M&S becoming a public company in 1936.

M&S is often viewed as a quintessentially British brand. As one the UK’s leading retailers, it
sells homeware, food and clothing to the masses. One of the elements that makes the retailer
so unique is that it has remained consistent with its corporate image while, at the same time,
continuously evolving. The retailer has always had a clear vision for the brand, which
concentrates on bringing quality to British consumers. Over the years, the retailer has had to
deal with many changes in its internal and external environment, which have impacted on its
business operations. The M&S customer has evolved, but M&S hasn’t always kept up with its
customers’ changing needs. Some would argue that the retailer has lost its competitive edge
and has failed to respond adequately to new entrants into the marketplace (Hodgson 2017).
The retailer has also survived recessions and has had to adapt to growing environmentalpage 710
concerns, social and cultural changes and technological advances. M&S responded to these
growing environmental and social concerns by launching ‘Plan A’ in 2007, which was its way of
helping to build a sustainable future by being a business that enables its customers to have a
positive impact on well-being, communities and the planet through everything it does (Calnan
2020). More recently, M&S has reset Plan A on its mission to become a net zero business
across their entire value chain by 2040. Through Plan A, M&S is working with its customers and
suppliers to combat climate change, reduce waste, use sustainable raw materials, trade
ethically and help customers to lead healthier lifestyles (Mace 2021). In terms of economic
factors, the UK’s decision to leave the EU has had an impact on the retailer’s European
business amid complex red tape, which has led to the axing of 11 French high-street stores
(Armitage 2021). This has left people wondering whether M&S will continue to be a formidable
presence on the high street in future years.
Changing the M&S Business Model
M&S’s fortunes have changed over the years. Its profits peaked in the financial year 1997/98,
when it became the first British retailer to make a pre-tax profit of over £1 billion. However, it
subsequently went into a sudden slump, which took the company and its shareholders, who
included hundreds of thousands of small investors, by surprise (Rose 2007). Even though the
retailer recovered somewhat from this, in the late 2010s it experienced financial decline. M&S
reported headline pre-tax profits of £613.8 million in 2017, but in 2018 this declined further to
£573 million. Shares in the retailer also almost halved in value, having peaked at 59p in 2015
(Business World 2018). While M&S had dominated the UK clothing market for decades, its
position as the clothes retailer with the largest market share was ‘perilously close to being lost
to Primark’ (Halliday 2018). Faced with these financial difficulties, in early 2016 Steve Rowe
took over the reins as the new CEO of the retail chain (Treanor 2016). Tasked with turning the
retailer’s fortunes around, in 2018 Rowe unveiled a new five-year turnaround plan to overcome
some of the challenges facing the retailer, and to revive the brand and make M&S special again
(Wadham 2022).
Rowe’s turnaround plan made ‘recovering and growing’ M&S clothing and home one of the top
priorities, while at the same time not losing the retailer’s focus on food. When it came to the
food side of its business, M&S had always done an excellent job of positioning its food as a
premium treat to aspire to, through attractive communication and clever activation. In 2018,
food sales were positive, with M&S’s food business accounting for around half of its revenue.
Maintaining this momentum was seen as a key to the retailer’s success, but this was no easy
task for the retailer given the fact that its food was viewed as too expensive by some, and as
the discounters such as Aldi and Lidl caught up (Tan 2016). However, M&S was very much a
divided business. While its food offering was seen as premium, British, high quality and
aspirational, its clothing and other merchandise failed to gain traction. Its clothing division had
been a perennial headache for M&S, with years of falling sales. Customers had been steadily
losing interest in this side of the retailer’s business, and it had been trying to rework this. On his
initiation of the turnaround plan, Rowe announced the retailer’s intentions to slash prices, make
clearer who its clothing product lines were for, and simply be more in tune with who the M&S
customer was, in an attempt to re-establish its price position in the market (Tan 2016).
M&S’s turnaround plan also included attempts to transform the retailer’s UK store estate. Critics
argued that the retailer simply had too many shops and that its store portfolio needed to bepage 711
reduced. In May 2018, M&S announced the radical decision to close more than 100 of its stores
by 2022, with these closures affecting its clothing and home stores, which had underperformed
for several years. Through store closures, it hoped to better deal with its deteriorating financial
performance (McMillan Woods 2017). In addition, M&S’s turnaround plan also focused on its
desire to become a digital-first retailer. The retailer had suffered due to its slow-moving and
unimpressive approach to e-commerce. It had struggled to adapt to this changing retail
environment, and its slow response to develop the online side of its business left it playing
catch-up with savvier retailers like ASOS and Zara (Rigby 2017).
‘Never the Same Again’
When the pandemic hit in 2020, Marks & Spencer was already in the middle of its turnaround
plan aimed at improving its fortunes. As with most retailers, the pandemic had a huge impact on
M&S’s business, with the group recording a loss of £201.2 million during the period. However,
the British retailer believed that the coronavirus crisis would indelibly change its business and
that it would accelerate its turnaround (Davey 2020). Seeing the shift to online shopping being
driven by the pandemic, M&S announced its ‘Never the Same Again’ strategy. The plan was an
effort to fast-track several initiatives it had in the pipeline and bring them to the market at a
reduced time frame. Those initiatives involved streamlining its management structure,
introducing third-party brands to its product offering, and reshuffling its store portfolio and online
presence (Anonymous 2022).
In September 2020, M&S teamed up with online supermarket Ocado to sell M&S food products
online (Machin 2020). The full M&S food range of 6,000 products was made available on the
platform, as well as 800 M&S everyday clothing and home lines. In addition to the Ocado
partnership, the ‘Never the Same Again’ strategy included a shift towards prioritizing the brand’s
value perception, broadening the appeal of its ranges and further investing in its online and
digital capacity. To broaden the appeal of its food business with families, M&S launched an
affordable ‘Remarksable Value’ food range in 2019 (Jefferson 2021). The aim was to roll out
grocery staples at affordable prices and, by doing so, engage with customers on its trusted
value and quality, and encourage them to do fuller, more regular purchases at M&S (European
Supermarket Magazine 2020).
M&S also expanded its online capability. In 2021, the retailer began to offer third-party brands
through its stores and online platforms for the first time (Jefferson 2021). M&S now sells
products from a host of other labels, such as Hobbs, Jack & Jones, Phase Eight, Triumph and
many more. This M&S move to start selling clothing from competitors was designed to pull in
more customers and turbocharge online sales (Valentine 2021). In July 2020, M&S relaunched
its Sparks loyalty scheme, shifting from a points-based plan delivered through a physical card
to a more customer friendly app-based, digital-first service. According to M&S, this shift now
allows the retailer to create a more personalized relationship with members (Jefferson 2021).
Conclusion
M&S is an organization that has undergone substantial change in recent years. For many
years, the business was drifting, but as a result of its five-year turnaround plan, it is now going
through a crucial period of transition – growing its online business, and revitalizing its business
model and market positioning. The retailer reported a profit of £523 million for the year to April
2022, representing a £120 million leap from the previous year. In addition, sales
rose 7 per cent to £10.8 billion (English 2022). Although things are looking positive
for the retailer, chief executive Steve Rowe stated that he wouldn’t be claiming victory too soon‘given the history of M&S’ (Pratley 2022). In the short term, the retailer expects sales to slow
due to rising costs and increased pressure on customer budgets. The company is facing
increased food costs, driven by global supply issues and labour shortages, while factory,
transport and freight costs, along with continued supply issues in China, are putting pressure on
its clothing and home business. It was also expected that M&S profits would fall in 2022 due to
a £31 million hit from scrapping its Russian business due to the conflict in Ukraine (Shapland
2022). Added to this, many consumers are choosing to economize as household budgets are
being squeezed by rising food, energy and fuel bills, with inflation at its highest level in 40 years
(Morton 2022). In May 2022, Steve Rowe announced he was stepping down as the CEO of
M&S. He spent six years overseeing the beginnings of a turnaround in the retailer’s fortunes,
after years in the doldrums. Rowe is being replaced by M&S’s head of food Stuart Mache and
co-chief executive Kate Bickerstaffe, its head of clothing and online sales. Alongside finance
boss Eoin Tonge, the trio will continue the M&S transformation (Butler 2022). Under this new
leadership, and as the M&S turnaround advances, it is hoped that M&S will continue to revive
its fortunes and have a strong future.

CASE 34
ANTHON BERG TRAVELS
THE WORLD WITH LUXURY
CHOCOLATES MADE IN
SCANDINAVIA
Background
Anthon Berg is one of the confectionery brands of Toms Gruppen A/S, headquartered in
Ballerup, Denmark. Founded in 1884, Anthon Berg manufactures high-quality chocolates. It is
popular for its marzipan and liquorice, and sells these in Denmark as well as in the Nordic
regions.Source: Helen89/Shutterstock
Anthon Berg is appointed by the Royal Danish Court. This honorary title is given to companies
that are well managed, economically sound, supply quality products and uphold good moral
standards.
In 1922, its liqueur-filled chocolate without a sugar crust was invented, using a unique
production method, and remains renowned today for its iconic miniature liqueur bottle shaped
chocolates.
The chocolatier uses the finest ingredients, such as premium dark chocolate, for its chocolate
liqueurs and collaborates with famous spirits brands like Remy Martin, Cointreau, Jim Beam
and Camus Cognac. Among its offer are liqueurs, cocktails, coffee liqueurs, single malt whisky
and Cognac selections.
Anthon Berg is a well-established brand in Europe, especially in Scandinavia, where it is sold
through wholesale and retail channels, and is a substantial player in these markets. It is a
relatively small player in the Asian market, however, which represents a potential growth
opportunity.
When entering a marketing planning phase, firms conduct a marketing audit and SWOT
analysis. Figure C34.1 presents the SWOT analysis for Anthon Berg.
FIGURE C34.1 SWOT analysis for Anthon Berg
Strengths Weaknesses
Strong brand heritage, producing liqueur￾filled chocolates since 1922
The liqueur-filled chocolates are without
sugar crusts, thus giving the original taste
of the spirits (most liqueur-filled chocolates
are produced with a sugar crust to prevent
the alcohol from evaporating, but Anthon
Berg’s unique production method means it
will not evaporate even without the sugar
crust)
There are no added alcohol flavourings
Unique production method, with distinctive
miniature liqueur bottle shaped chocolate
Premium dark chocolate is used (most
chocolate liqueurs are made with milk
chocolates)
Pairs well with coffee and/or tea or as a
dessert
Ideal for both gifting and self-consumption
Can be used to make a toast in (alcohol)
chocolates
Lack of brand awareness in Asia
Niche brand
Limited non-alcohol chocolate
selection, mostly with marzipan and
liquorice, which are not to Asian tastes
Anthon Berg has a very small
organization in Asia, primarily a sales
team, with distribution handled by an
external wholesale partner
Marketing support is limited to in-store
activities and sales promotion
Opportunities Threatspage 714
Few direct competitors, as most chocolate
liqueurs are liqueur-pralines (liqueur mixed
into chocolate) and not liqueur filled
Not many liqueur-filled chocolates in the
market
Liquor speciality shops
Religion sensitive, i.e. restrictions in
Muslim countries and not for Muslim
customers
Perception that chocolates are mostly
for children, where chocolate liqueurs
are not appropriate
Restrictions in countries like Korea and
Thailand where chocolate liqueurs are
not allowed for sale in the
supermarkets; in Malaysia only certain
supermarkets are allowed to sell
chocolate liqueurs or they have to be
displayed in the liquor section
Fierce competition and threat of new
entrants
‘Me-too’ liqueur-filled chocolates
The Market Challenge
The SWOT analysis reveals several challenges. Further areas for consideration include:
Product seasonality: confectionery/chocolates are seasonal/occasion gifting products in
Asia. For instance at New Year, Chinese New Year, Valentine’s Day, White Day, Easter,
Mother’s Day, Hari Raya and Christmas.
Climate: this type of confectionery is not a summer-season product–with high temperatures
likely to melt chocolates – however, entering the southern hemisphere could help counter
the weather factor and open opportunities there when it is hot in Europe.
Aggressive competition: confectionery and chocolate brands are fiercely competitive, but
the structure of the competition suggests market development opportunities exist:
Few direct competitors (chocolate filled with liqueur) – Abtey chocolate liqueurs (France),
Duc d’O (Belgium) and Goldkenn (Switzerland), but all with sugar crust.
Indirect competitors: competition from chocolates in the mass categories –
unlike Anthon Berg, multinational groups like Mondelez (Toblerone,
Cadbury, Milka), Mars (M&M’s, Snickers, Twix) and Nestlé (KitKat, Smarties, After Eight)
do not offer premium-quality ranges.
Competition in the mid-range: Ferrero Rocher and Kinder (Italy), Hershey’s (US) and
Lindt (Switzerland), and boutique brands like Godiva (Belgium), La Maison du Chocolat
and Valrhona (France), Teuscher (Switzerland), Neuhaus and Leonidas (Belgium), and
others.
The outcome of the SWOT analysis was to support opportunities, but also to manage

Present Further Challengespage 715
The arrival of Covid-19 in early 2020 suddenly exposed a new weakness for Anthon Berg in its
channel strategy: the brand’s reliance on airport distribution.
During the pandemic, airports across Asia, as in the rest of the world, were operating at very
low capacity, and travel restrictions around the world meant Anthon Berg’s sales came to a
complete stop. Anthon Berg had begun expanding into non-airport high-street and shopping
mall retail locations, but this new distribution strategy was still in its infancy, so non-airport sales
were weak.
The conditions that need to be met in order to be listed and stocked by chocolate stores and
supermarkets are rigorous, and profit margins slim. For this reason, Anthon Berg contemplated
opening own-brand retail stores in selected cities, similar to luxury chocolatier Godiva, which
has a store in Suntec City mall, Singapore. However, the fixed costs involved (e.g.
store rental, staff and day-to-day running expenses) are substantial, so Anthon
Berg took the strategic decision not to follow this approach.
Marketing Objectives Emerging From Covid-19:
Market Development
To achieve its objectives, the firm needs to allocate the resources needed to support market
developments in Asia. Anthon Berg’s strategic marketing team at its HQ in Denmark
understands that Asian business culture is different and has stated the importance of building
long-term partnerships, which it sees as critical for success in Asia. In these markets it can take
a long time to deliver profits, and it is of paramount importance to understand and appreciate
this.
In Asia and Australasia, the brand is traditionally sold in duty-free confectionery shops at
airports, for example in China, India, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore
and Australia. In 2020, Anthon Berg began to expand into domestic market channels.
As part of the brand’s marketing plan, a strategic decision made in early 2020: no matter what –
and despite a dramatic fall in sales – the company would remain in Asia. Of course, nobody at
the time knew the pandemic would still be around two years later, but the firm decided to stay
put and be ready for the recovery.
The key reason for this is that, if you pull out – even for a short while – from the duty-free airport
sales channels in Asia, it is extremely difficult to get back in, even when travellers return to air
travel. The sales channels in Asia value loyalty extremely highly, taking the view that you are
partners in good times as well as bad.
While waiting for airport sales to pick up again to pre-Covid-19 levels, the brand has managed
to diversify its sales to new channels and is now listed as part of the duty-free offer on Korean
Air flights. It also has a partnership with a Chinese firm by the name of Fenjiu. So, there is a
possibility of improving fortunes for the firm.
Events in the competitive market environment might also help to unexpectedly improve Anthon
Berg’s performance in Asian markets, as key European competitors have now pulled out of
Asia. Switzerland’s Goldkenn, for example, decided to exit these markets. It was a direct key
competitor for Anthon Berg in Asia, with its liqueur-filled chocolate collection. Anthon Berg is
staying in Asia to fulfil its relationship promises and strategic objectives, despite having been
through a challenging period 2020–21.page 716
Questions
1. In spring 2020 – given the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on sales – would you have
made the same decision as Anthon Berg to accept losses in the short term to remain in
Asia, not knowing for how long the company would have to endure these losses?
2. Not knowing how long the pandemic would last, what would have been your business
considerations in deciding how long Anthon Berg should remain in Asia? And, given that
airport sales is the brand’s key sales channel, which metrics would you include in your
considerations (e.g. business, financial, strategic)?
3. Besides airport sales, which other distribution channels would you consider relevant and
potentially profitable? Consider, for example, joint ventures, opening up own stores,
supermarkets, speciality stores.
4. Given that Anthon Berg’s chocolate liqueurs contain alcohol, which markets would you
prioritize and why?

atisfying customers is central to the marketing concept, but it is not enough
to guarantee success. The real question is whether a firm can satisfy
customers better than the competition. For example, many car
manufacturers market vehicles that give customer satisfaction in terms of
appearance, reliability and performance; they meet the basic requirements
necessary to compete. Customer choice, however, will depend on creatingmore value than the competition. Extra value is brought about by establishing
a competitive advantage – a topic that will be examined later in this chapter.
Since corporate performance depends on both customer satisfaction and
creating greater value than the competition, firms need to understand their
competitors as well as their customers. By understanding its competitors, a
firm can better predict their reactions to any marketing initiative it might make
and exploit any weaknesses. Competitor analysis is thus crucial to the
successful implementation of marketing strategy. Our discussion of
competitors in this chapter begins by examining competitive industry structure,
explains how to create competitive and differential advantage, and then
explains cost leadership. Finally, we explore the key elements associated with
developing a competitive marketing strategy.
Analysing Competitive Industry
Structure
An industry is a group of firms that market products that are close substitutes
for one another. There is more to understanding an industry and how it works
than the core product or service being sold. Commonly, we refer to the oil,
computer or retail industry. Some industries are more profitable than others. In
the past, the car, steel, coal and textile industries have been highly profitable;
in more recent years, however, they have had less profitable records compared
with high-tech and creative industries (e.g. software as a service, cloud
computing, publishing, web development), while pharmaceuticals and soft
drinks industries have recently enjoyed high profits. Not all of this difference
can be explained by the fact that one industry provides better customer
satisfaction than another. Other determinants of industry attractiveness and
long-run profitability shape the rules of competition. These are the threat of
entry of new competitors, the threat of substitutes, the bargaining power of
buyers and suppliers, and the rivalry between the existing competitors (Porter
1980). The intensity of these forces shapes an industry and its levels of
performance. Their influence is shown diagrammatically in Figure 18.1, which
shows what is known as the Porter model of competitive industry structure.
FIGURE 18.1The Porter model of competitive industry structure
Each of the five forces, in turn, comprises a number of elements that,
together, combine to determine the strength of each force and its effect on the
degree of competition. Each force is discussed below.
The threat of new entrantsNew entrants can raise the level of competition in an industry, which may
ultimately reduce its attractiveness. For example, Nestlé owns Nespresso, a
brand that sells more than 14 billion coffee capsules a year in 84 countries
(Cumming 2020). The brand made significant investment in building the
market for its capsules and coffee machines, using an extensive advertising
campaign fronted by Hollywood actor George Clooney and, more recently,
coffee producers, to add a more natural and organic feel. It also built an
extensive database of information about customers who bought into the
Nespresso ‘club’, which it uses to develop and expand sales. The market for
the product grew as consumers could easily make their favourite espresso
coffee using a Nespresso machine. The brand’s high levels of profitability
attracted many new entrants, including Starbucks, Tassimo, Senseo, Jacobs
Douwe Egberts, Green Mountain, Côte d’Or and Kenco (see Exhibit 18.1), to
the market Nestlé had basically created. The capsule market grew faster than
coffee as a whole, with new entrants offering different varieties and, cheaper
and recyclable capsules as a way of gaining market share (Cumming 2020).
EXHIBIT 18.1

The threat of new entrants depends on the barriers to entry. High entry
barriers exist in some industries (e.g. pharmaceutical manufacturing), whereas
other industries and sectors are much easier to enter (e.g. online retailing –
setting up an e-commerce website is less resource intensive than building a
vehicle manufacturing plant). Key entry barriers include:
economies of scalepage 719
page 720
capital requirements
switching costs
access to distribution
expected retaliation.
For present competitors, industry attractiveness can be increased by raising
entry barriers. High promotional and research and development (R&D)
expenditures are some methods of raising barriers, as in the situation with the
Nespresso coffee pods. Nestlé continues to make a significant investment in
these areas and, to further protect its market, has struck a deal worth billions of
dollars with its competitor Starbucks. Both brands benefit from wider
distribution networks and greater access to new markets (BBC 2018). Other
ways of raising barriers are by taking out patents and developing strong
relationships/partnerships with suppliers and/or distributors.

The bargaining power of suppliers
The cost of raw materials, components and intellectual skills can have a major
bearing on a firm’s profitability. The higher the bargaining power of suppliers,
the higher the cost of the goods. For example, the bargaining power of
suppliers will be high when:
there are many buyers and few dominant suppliers
there are differentiated highly valued products
suppliers threaten to integrate forwards into the industry
buyers do not threaten to integrate backwards into supply
the industry is not a key customer group to the suppliers.

Mowgli and the Rise of Street FoodThe market
While fast food includes burgers, hot dogs, fish and chips, sandwiches, pizza and food to
eat in the street, ‘street food’ has taken on a different guise with many international
influences on the flavours of this type of food. It is growing increasingly popular and
beginning to represent serious competition for more traditional food outlets. The street food
market in the UK is forecast to grow to more than £1.2 billion (€1.42 billion), with foodie
delicacies from India, Uganda, The Philippines, Mexico, China and beyond. Supermarkets
are also picking up on this new approach to food: frozen food chain Iceland introduced its
own range of Mumbai street food; Sainsbury’s has introduced a range of Caribbean street
food, Irie Eats, with spicy jerk chicken and traditional curry.

The new entrant
Mowgli Street Food is an emergent street-food restaurant chain in the UK, which is offering
a different dining event: a chaotic, lively atmosphere designed to recreate an authentic
experience. Mowgli was founded in 2014 by Nisha Katona, who wanted to create a very
different impression of Indian food. Nisha, a former barrister, is a food writer and YouTuber,
and she is passionate about sharing the fresh flavours and health benefits of Indian food.
Between 2014 and 2022, Nisha opened 18 Mowgli restaurants.
The differentiated experience
When you arrive at a Mowgli (in Leeds, say) you may need to squeeze in the doorway and
wait, or enjoy sitting on the swing seat and soak up the atmosphere, illuminated by twinkling
lights. When you arrive at your table, you’ll find a menu full of delights, from alcohol-free
cocktails to delicious bites of Monkey Wrap (tandoori chicken seasoned with tamarind) and
Himalayan Cheese on Toast. Main dishes are served in tiffins (lunch boxes) of various
sizes. Tiffin culture is very popular in India, for workers and on the streets of Mumbai, as a
way to carry home cooked food or to take it on long journeys.

A firm can reduce the bargaining power of suppliers by seeking new sources of
supply, threatening to integrate backwards into supply and designing
standardized components so that many suppliers can produce them.
Backwards integration means a buyer purchases the supplier and a form of
vertical integration takes place. Vehicle manufacturers (e.g. VW, Mercedes,
Toyota and Tesla) use vertically integrated in-house manufacturing systems.
The bargaining power of buyers
The concentration of buyers can lower manufacturers’ bargaining power. For
example, Apple Inc. ended its long-term relationship with Intel processors,
replacing the chip with the M1 processor manufactured by Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) so it could build more innovative
and exciting computers and have better integration with its hardware and
software (Knight 2021).
The bargaining power of buyers is greater when:
there are few dominant buyers and many sellers
products are standardized
buyers threaten to integrate backwards into the industry
suppliers do not threaten to integrate forwards into the buyer’s industry
the industry is not a key supplying group for buyers.
Manufacturing firms in the industry can attempt to reduce buyer power by
increasing the number of buyers they sell to, threatening to integrate forwards
into the buyer’s industry and producing highly valued, differentiated products.
Apple is a leading IT product manufacturer and retailer around the world, with
its dedicated high-tech Apple product stores, and as one of the world’s most
valuable brands has significant buying power (see Exhibit 18.2).

Threat of substitutes
The presence of substitute products can lower industry attractiveness and
profitability, because these put a constraint on price levels. For example, tea
and coffee are close substitutes in many European countries. Raising the price
of coffee, therefore, would make tea more attractive. The threat of substitute
products depends on:
buyers’ willingness to substitute
the relative price and performance of substitutes
the costs of switching to substitutes.
The threat of substitute products can be lowered by building up switching costs
or, for example, by creating a strong, distinctive brand and maintaining a price
differential in line with perceived customer values. If these tactics fail to deter
a rival from launching a substitute product, the incumbent is faced with the
following options: copy the substitute and build in a differential advantage
(e.g. discount retailer Aldi sells Nordpak butter, which is strikingly similar to –
but cheaper than – the Danish brand Lurpak); form a strategic alliance with the
rival (such as the aforementioned example of Nestlé and Starbucks coffee);
buy the rival (LVMH took control of Christian Dior in a €12 billion deal); or
move to a new market (Amazon is always on the lookout for new market
opportunities, so its move into streaming, to challenge other similar services
such as Apple TV+ and Netflix, and its move to digital advertising, to
challenge Google and Facebook, comes as no surprise). During the global
Covid pandemic Zoom emerged as a substitute and key competitor for
Microsoft Teams in the videoconferencing market.page 722
Industry competitors
The intensity of rivalry between competitors in an industry will depend on the
following factors:
Structure of the competition: There is more intense rivalry when there are
many small competitors or a few equally balanced competitors, and less
rivalry when a clear market leader exists with a large cost advantage.
Software markets are intense, highly dynamic and competitive, especially in
analysis software; Microsoft, Oracle, IBM and SAP vie for market share at
the top of the market, but there are hundreds of firms around the world in
this market.
Structure of costs: High fixed costs encourage price-cutting to fill
capacity. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch manufacturer of Dove soap
and Magnum ice cream, has seen sales fall, especially in US markets. Its
response has been to lower its prices to maintain demand for production
outputs (Chaudhuri 2018). The FMCG manufacturer has also invested £10
million (€11.8 million) in a rebrand of Magnum, to ‘reinforce the range’s
position as a timeless classic’ (Woolfson 2022).
Degree of differentiation: Basic commodity products encourage rivalry,
while highly differentiated products that are hard to copy are associated with
less intense rivalry. T-Mobile, for instance, stood out in mobile phone
market as an innovator in the industry – transparent and customer friendly,
with an unlimited price plan that at one time made it the only operator to
offer a national unlimited 4G data plan (Trefis Team 2017). However, rivals
EE, O2
, Virgin, Vodafone and other competitors now vie with it for the best
unlimited pricing plans, and have added new services such as branded
handsets and different pricing plans to differentiate from competitors.
Switching costs: Rivalry is reduced when switching costs are high because
the product is specialized, the customer has invested a lot of resources in
learning how to use the product and there are strong relational ties. In
Europe, cooperative banks have a large market share in retail and corporate
banking sectors. However, research indicates that cooperative banks like
Crédit Agricole (France), DZ Bank (Germany) and Banche Popolari (Italy)
have lower switching costs than commercial banks, suggesting high
switching costs do not necessarily offer robust protection from rivals
(Egarius and Weill 2016). Many banks offer incentives for customers to
switch accounts, such as monetary offers and added account benefits.Strategic objectives: When competitors are pursuing build strategies,
competition is likely to be more intense than when following hold
objectives or harvest objectives.
Exit barriers: When barriers to leaving an industry are high due to such
factors as lack of opportunities elsewhere, high vertical integration,
emotional barriers or the high cost of closing down plant, rivalry will be
more intense than when exit barriers are low.
A firm needs to balance its own position against the well-being of the industry
so as not to spoil a situation of competitive stability. For example, an intense
price, promotional or brand territory confrontation may gain a firm a few
percentage points in market share but lead to an overall fall in long-run
industry profitability as competitors respond to these moves. It is sometimes
better to protect industry structure than follow short-term self-interest.
Revenue in investment banking is in decline, and a price war could intensify
and increase competition, leading to lost revenue and profits for all the major
players, such as Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley (Noonan 2018).
A major threat to favourable industry structure is the use of a no-frills low￾price strategy by a minor player seeking positional advantage. For example,
the launch of generic products in the pharmaceutical and airline industries has
lowered overall profitability. But low-cost operators face many challenges to
maintain their position once established. Ryanair staff showed their
dissatisfaction by going on strike, and many thousands of travellers were left
stranded. The low-cost airline operator is faced with aggrieved flight crews
because of poor pay and working conditions. This leaves the airline facing
challenges, as increases to pay and conditions would hurt profits and create
opportunities for competitors (Davies 2018).
An intensive competitive environment means the value created by firms in
satisfying customer needs is given away to buyers through lower prices,
dissipated through costly marketing battles (e.g. advertising) or passed on to
powerful suppliers through higher prices for raw materials and components.

MARKETING IN ACTION 18.1
Hotel Chocolat Takes On the Competition and Wins by
Making Chocolate Exciting
Consumers enjoy chocolate, and there is increasing demand for premium chocs, organic
and sugar-free products. Despite a fall in demand during Covid-19 due to supply issues,
and government restrictions on the movement of goods, the global market is predicted to
recover and grow to sales of more than $172 billion by 2026. Chocolate
markets are geographically segmented (e.g. Asia Pacific, North and South
America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa). Each region has its own favourites, and
competition is intense for consumer spending. In Europe, consumers are willing to pay for
high-quality, handmade, organic and dark chocolate (with less sugar content). Leading
manufacturers (e.g. Nestlé and Mars) regularly launch new products to enhance their
portfolios, to meet consumer demand. Ferrero Group expanded its range through the
acquisition of UK speciality chocolate manufacturer and retailer Thorntons plc. Most large
manufacturers sell their brands through wholesale markets to retail brands, but some
smaller firms have grown by spotting gaps in this highly competitive market.

Hotel Chocolat began its challenge for market share online in 1993, and then, in 2004,
opened its first shop in London. By 2022, it had 126 stores and a thriving online operation.
Founders of Hotel Chocolat, Angus Thirlwell and Peter Harris, went about taking over the
market by producing fresh premium chocolates from their own cacao farms and establishing
direct links with growers to ensure authenticity. To stand out and differentiate the brand they
focused on:
originality – innovations to traditional products, such as Easter eggs with thick shells
(the industry makes thin shells) and giant slabs of chocolate; they also developed a
vegan milk alternative and many other innovative product offers not available elsewhere
authenticity – growing its own beans at the Rabot Estate in St Lucia and reducing sugar
content by using more cocoa (40–50 per cent, which is above the industry average)page 724
ethics – fairness to farmers; in 2021, Hotel Chocolat introduced a pioneering approach,
giving a certified living income in return for growers ensuring sustainability goals are
achieved.
When Hotel Chocolat launched its first store, Thorntons was the incumbent dominant
chocolate retailer, with around 300 shops across the UK. But the challenger brand had a
special aim, ‘to make chocolate exciting again’, and it succeeded in overtaking the
competition, with Thorntons selling its brand to Ferrero in 2015, and by 2020 its stores had
completely disappeared from UK high streets.

Competitor Analysis
The analysis of how industry structure affects long-run profitability has shown
the need to understand and monitor competitors. The actions of competitors
can spoil an otherwise attractive industry, their weaknesses can be a target for
exploitation and their response to a firm’s marketing initiatives can have a
major impact on that firm’s success. Indeed, firms that focus on competitors’
actions have been found to achieve better business performance than those that
pay less attention to their competitors (Noble et al. 2002). Competitive
information and intelligence can be obtained from many sources. Managing
information is vital to a firm’s success and long-term survival. Advances in
technology have led to a proliferation of customer and competitor data, so
firms need to develop integrated approaches to ensure they can turn
fragmented and complex data sets into useable market intelligence (Klaas
Jagersma 2011). Competitive intelligence from digital sources is dynamic,
global and often instantaneous, and web-based systems are used to organize
and disseminate information. Firms use digital information sources when
entering new markets, developing new products, developing strategic
initiatives, restructuring business units and carrying out a whole range of
activities that can help them beat the competition. Competitive intelligence
enables firms to make better strategic decisions, enhance their market
knowledge and improve dynamic capabilities (Markovich et al. 2022). Today’s
dynamic market intelligence can also act as an early-warning system,
highlighting new competitive moves and threats to a firm (Schoemaker et al.
2018).When beginning to conduct competitor analysis, it is important to consider
five key questions:
1. Who are our competitors?
2. What are their strengths and weaknesses?
3. What are their strategic objectives and thrust?
4. What are their strategies?
5. What are their response patterns?
These issues are summarized in Figure 18.2.
FIGURE 18.2
Competitor analysisWho are our competitors?
We need to take a wide view of the potential competition. If only those firms
producing technically similar products are the competition (e.g. paint firms), it
is possible to miss other sources of competition, for example ignoring firms
that produce substitute products that perform a similar function (e.g. firms
producing polyurethane varnish), and those that solve a problem or eliminate it
in a dissimilar way (e.g. PVC double-glazing firms). The actions of all types of
competitors can affect the performance of a firm and should be monitored;
their responses also need to be assessed, as they will determine the outcome of
any competitive move that the competing firms may wish to make. All
competing firms face loss of market share or being made irrelevant if they do
not understand the competitive landscape. Making the competition irrelevant is
a strategic option discussed later in this chapter.
The marketing environment needs to be scanned for potential entrants into
the industry. Entrants can take two forms: those with technically similar
products and those invading the market with substitute products. Firms with
similar core competences to those of the present incumbents may pose the
threat of entering with technically similar products. For example, Apple’s skills
in computer electronics provided the springboard for it to become market
leader in several key technology markets, such as the portable music player
market with its iPod, tablet computers with its iPad, and mobile phones with
its iPhone and Apple Watch. The source of firms entering with substitute
products may be more difficult to locate, however. A technological
breakthrough may transform an industry by rendering the old product obsolete,
for example voice-activated speakers such as Amazon Echo replacing radios
and alarm clocks. In such instances, it is difficult to locate the source of the
substitute product well in advance. Figure 18.3 illustrates this competitive
arena.
FIGURE 18.3
Competitor identificationpage 725
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used to support or even
replace human decision-making in managerial settings. AI is used to predict
outcomes of strategic decisions and anticipate how competitive advantage may
change over time. The deployment of AI is still relatively modest, but
applications are increasing and becoming more widespread (Krakowski et al.
2021).
What are competitors’ strengths and weaknesses?
Having identified our competitors, the next stage is to complete a competitor
audit to assess their relative strengths and weaknesses. Understanding
competitor strengths and weaknesses is an important prerequisite for
developing a competitor strategy and identifying a competitor’s vulnerabilities.
The process of assessing competitors’ strengths and weaknesses may take
place as part of a marketing audit (see Chapter 17). As much internal, marketand customer information should be gathered as possible, and ideally made
accessible through dynamic web-based information systems (e.g. financial data
concerning profitability, profit margins, sales and investment levels; market
data relating to price levels, market share and distribution channels used; and
customer data concerning awareness of brand names, perceptions of brand and
firm image, product and service quality and selling ability).
Not all information will be easily accessible. Management needs to decide
the extent to which each element of information is worth pursuing. For
example, a decision is required regarding how much expenditure is to be
allocated to measuring customer awareness and perceptions through marketing
research.
This process of data gathering needs to be managed so that information is
available to compare the firm with its competitors on the key factors for
success in the industry. A three-stage process can then be used:
1. Identify key factors for success in the industry: Factors may be functional
(such as financial strength or flexible production) or generic (for example,
the ability to respond quickly to customer needs, innovativeness or the
capability to provide other sales services). Since these factors are critical for
success, they should be used to compare the firm with its competitors.
2. Rate the firm and competitors on each key success factor using a rating
scale: Each firm is given a score on each success factor, using a rating
device such as a scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). The
ratings result in a set of firm capability profiles. An example is given in
Figure 18.4. In this example, the firm is rated alongside two competitors on
six key success factors. Compared with the firm, competitor 1 is relatively
strong regarding technical assistance to customers and access to
international distribution channels, but relatively weak on product quality.
Competitor 2 is relatively strong on international distribution channels but
relatively weak on innovativeness, financial strength and having a well￾qualified workforce.
3. Consider the implications for competitive strategy: The competitive profile
analysis helps to identify possible competitive strategies. The analysis in our
example suggests that the firm should consider taking steps to improve
technical assistance to customers, to match or exceed competitor 1’s
capability on this factor. Currently, the firm enjoys a differential advantage
over competitor 1 on product quality. The firm’s strength in innovativenesspage 726
should be used to maintain this differential advantage, and competitor 1’s
moves to improve product quality should be monitored carefully.
FIGURE 18.4
Firm capability profiles
What are competitors’ strategic objectives and
thrust?
The third part of competitor analysis is to infer competitors’ strategic
objectives. In Chapter 17, we discussed how firms might determine their
broader strategic aims by deciding which products they need to sell into
particular markets. Likewise, knowing the strategic thrust of competitors can
help with strategic marketing planning decision-making and also set the
overall direction that defines the target market (Varadarajan 2010). Equally, it
is useful to know which strategic objectives are being pursued by competitors,
because competitors’ response patterns and marketing strategies may depend
upon their objectives. Knowing whether a competitor is planning to build,
hold, harvest or divest products and/or strategic business units is also
important for planning.Determining a competitor’s objectives can be difficult, as information of a
strategic nature can be hard to come by. However, by studying market
conditions, it is possible to garner insight into what objectives a competitor
might be seeking to achieve and then infer the possible implementation actions
it might pursue to succeed. Table 18.1 summarizes the market conditions and
implementation actions that might occur when a competitor starts to pursue a
strategic marketing objective.

What are competitors’ strategies?
At the product and/or service level, competitor analysis will attempt to deduce
positioning strategy. This involves assessing a competitor’s target market and
the differential advantage of its product and/or service. The marketing mix
strategies (e.g. price levels, media used for promotion, distribution channels)
may indicate the target market, and marketing research into customer
perceptions can be used to assess relative differential advantages.
Competitors should be monitored continuously for changes in positioning
strategy. For example, Volvo’s traditional positioning strategy, based on safety,
has been modified to give more emphasis to performance and style, enabling
the firm to compete with other high-performance cars.
Strategies can also be defined in terms of competitive scope. For example,
are competitors attempting to service the whole market or a few segments of a
niche? If a competitor is a niche player, is it likely it will be content to stay in
that segment or will it use the niche as a beachhead from which to move into
other segments in the future? Japanese firms are renowned for their use of
small niche markets as springboards for market segment expansion (e.g. the
small car segments in the US and Europe).
Competitors may use cost leadership, focusing on cost-reducing measures
rather than expensive product development and promotional strategies. (Cost
leadership will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.) If competitorsare following this strategy, it is more likely that they will be focusing R&D
expenditure on process rather than product development in a bid to reduce
manufacturing costs.
What are competitors’ response patterns?
A key consideration in making a strategic or tactical move is the likely
response of competitors. Indeed, it is a major objective of competitor analysis
to be able to predict competitor response to market and competitive changes. A
competitor’s past behaviour is also a guide to what they might do in the future.
Market leaders often try to control competitor response by retaliatory action.
These are called retaliatory competitors because they can be relied on to
respond aggressively to competitive challenges. For example, Amazon
acquired LoveFilm, a video-streaming and DVD rental service, in a
competitive move against US rival Netflix. LoveFilm was eventually sidelined
as demand for DVDs declined and the competitive intensity in video-streaming
markets increased. Amazon Prime now offers live video streaming and video￾on-demand services.
By punishing competitor moves, market leaders can condition competitors
to behave in predicted ways, for example by not taking advantage of a price
rise by the leader. It is not only market leaders that retaliate aggressively.
Where management is known to be assertive and a move is likely to have a
major impact on performance, a strong response is usual.
The history, traditions and managerial personalities of competitors also
have an influence on competitive response. Some markets are characterized by
years of competitive stability with little serious strategic challenge to any of
the incumbents. This can breed complacency, with predictably slow reaction
times to new challenges. For example, innovation that offers superior customer
value may be dismissed as a fad and unworthy of serious attention.
Another situation where competitors are unlikely to respond is where their
previous strategies have restricted their scope for retaliation. An example of
one such hemmed-in competitor was a major manufacturer of car number
plates that were sold to car dealerships. A new firm was started by an ex￾employee, who focused on one geographical area, supplying the same quality
product but with an extra discount. The national supplier could not respond,
since to give a discount in that region would have meant granting the discount
nationwide.page 728
A fourth type of competitor may respond selectively. Because of tradition,
or beliefs about the relative effectiveness of marketing instruments, a
competitor may respond to some competitive moves but not others. For
example, extra sales promotion expenditures may be matched but advertising
increases to, say, build brand awareness may be ignored. Another reason for
selective response is the varying degree of visibility of marketing actions. For
example, giving extra price discounts may be highly visible, but providing
distributors with extra support (e.g. training, sales literature, loans) may be less
discernible.
A final type of competitor is totally unpredictable in its response pattern.
Sometimes there is a response while, at other times, there is none. Some moves
are countered aggressively, while with others reaction is weak. No factors
explain these differences adequately – they appear to be at the whim of
management.
Competitive Advantage
The key is to understand a firm’s superior performance and how to gain and
hold this to create a sustainable competitive advantage. This concept was
initially explored by Powell (1992), who focused on how it underpins strategy
formulation. Our understanding of competitive advantage has evolved since;
Porter (1985) suggested it was generated when value was created for
customers. His value chain model was a useful way of locating superior skills
and resources across a firm’s value chain. By looking at the primary activities
carried out by a firm (e.g. manufacturing operations, sales and marketing, and
services) and support activities (e.g. procurement, technology development,
firm infrastructure and HR), managers could identify value-creating areas that
could be further enhanced to create competitive advantage. Hamel and
Prahalad (1989) advocated that, when seeking value-creating opportunities,
firms must find how they can use resources and internal skills to develop core
competences that enable them to respond and be agile in terms of changing
customer needs and wants (Prahalad and Hamel 2006). Throughout the early
part of the twenty-first century, technology has played an increasingly
important role in how firms create and sustain competitive advantage (Bilgihanand Wang 2016). Wherever sources of competitive advantage are found it is
seen as central to strategic marketing management, and it is critical to business
survival (Cenamor 2021). Figure 18.5 shows sources of competitive
advantage.
FIGURE 18.5
Sources of competitive advantage
Firms can gain a competitive advantage through differentiation of their
product and service offering by providing, utilizing or cultivating superior
sources of competitive advantage. Alternatively, customer value can be created
by managing a firm’s operation for lowest delivered cost. How firms are using
digital technologies and social media is becoming increasingly fundamental to
remaining competitive. See Marketing in Action 18.2 to find out more.

Adidas teamed up with Beyoncé and leisure and clothing brand Ivy Park, to introduced the
Super Sleek sports shoe, a redesign of the Stan Smith brand first launched in the 1970s.
The Ivytopia collection follows on from five previous collaborations between these two firms.
With its gender-neutral sizing and designs themed around finding a personal nirvana, this
collection aims to stand out and grab attention online.
Many brands aim to bring an added dimension of authenticity to capture the attention of
users of Twitter, Facebook and social media platforms. H&M introduced a new brand
ambassador, British comedian Munya Chawawa, on Instagram with the hashtag #HMMAN.
Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka teamed up with Levi’s to produce a limited-edition
range of vintage upcycled denim wear, bringing her own unique style, determination and
passion for her generation to the brand.
Creating digital advantage, brands like Adidas, H&M and Levi’s are becoming highly skilled
at using social media to create a buzz around their products and build a loyal customer
base. Brands need to adapt and learn how to create competitive advantage in the digital as
well as the physical world. Standing out online is a challenge. Successful brands should
ensure they are true to their brand values and promises, as well as being visually and
aesthetically pleasing. In the digital landscape, there are opportunities to connect to a tribe
of followers, who extend beyond a traditional target segment, and to foster long-term
customer loyalty. Successful digital brands cultivate loyal customers through building
emotional ties and optimizing their customers’ lifetime value. Digital communications can
increase the visibility of a brand but also make more strategically important connections.
In the future, brands are likely to be competing for measurable digital KPIs (key
performance indicators), such as number of ‘likes’ and unique visitors per month, as well as
revenue.Based on: Joseph (2014); Interbrand (2018); McCarthy (2018); Hammond (2021); Adidas
(2022)
To create a differentiated or lowest cost position, a firm needs to
understand the nature and location of the potential sources of competitive
advantage and develop a dynamic competitive strategy.
Competitive strategies
Combining competitive advantage with the competitive scope of activities
(broad versus narrow) results in four generic strategies: differentiation, cost
leadership, differentiation focus and cost focus. The differentiation and cost
leadership strategies seek competitive advantage in a broad range of market or
industry segments, whereas differentiation focus and cost focus strategies are
confined to a narrow segment (Porter 1980).
Differentiation
Differentiation strategy involves the selection of one or more choice criteria
that are used by many buyers in an industry. The firm then uniquely positions
itself to meet these criteria. Differentiation strategies are usually associated
with a premium price and higher-than-average costs for the industry, as the
extra value to customers (e.g. higher performance) often raises costs. The aim
is to differentiate in a way that leads to a price premium in excess of the cost of
differentiating. Differentiation gives customers a reason to prefer one product
over another, and thus is central to strategic marketing thinking.
Here are some examples of brands that have achieved success using a
differentiation strategy:
Nissan produced the Leaf, a battery electric car, which met the needs of
customers looking for a greener solution. The innovations incorporated into
the car enabled it to become the bestselling electronic vehicle in Europe.
Toyota has built its success and reputation by targeting a broad market with
highly reliable, high build quality, stylish and environmentally friendly cars.
The vehicle manufacturer operates with a lean approach to manufacturing,
which enables a keen focus on customer requirements and being able to
respond swiftly to changing customer demands. Hybrid cars, electric
vehicles and electric lift trucks used in warehouses around the world are justpage 730
some of the innovative developments that have enabled Toyota to
differentiate from competitors such as GM, Ford and Fiat (Toyota 2022).
Dyson differentiated its vacuum cleaners by inventing a bagless version that
outperformed its rivals by providing greater suction and convenience and
eliminated the need to buy and install dust bags. Its vacuum cleaners are
also differentiated from other brands by their distinctive design.
Google created a differential advantage over its search engine rivals by
enabling the most relevant websites to be ranked at the top of listings.
Cost leadership
This strategy involves the achievement of the lowest cost position in an
industry. Many segments in the industry are served, and great importance is
attached to minimizing costs throughout the business. As long as the price
achievable for its products is around the industry average, cost
leadership should result in superior performance. Thus cost leaders
often market standard products believed to be acceptable to customers (e.g.
Heinz, United Biscuits, P&G and Unilever), the strategy being to market
acceptable products at reasonable prices, which means their low costs result in
above-average profits. Walmart is also a cost leader, which allows the firm the
option of charging lower prices than its rivals to achieve higher sales and yet
achieve comparable profit margins, or to match competitors’ prices and attain
higher profit margins. Zara, owned by Inditex, has an extremely efficient
supply chain that not only enables the brand to produce very low-cost fashion
garments, but also to get products to market faster than its competitors.
However, according to research by Kelly et al. (2018) the model of
continual grow through achieving a low-cost position is being challenged, with
mass-market FMCGs in household products and food experiencing low growth
of 1–2 per cent, and the benefits of economies of scale are not as profitable as
in the past. Disruptive trends are starting to reshape consumer goods markets.
For example:
The millennial effect – 35 and younger, these consumers research what they
buy online, will avoid FMCG goods and are more likely to pay more for
special items that fit their chosen lifestyles.
Digital intimacy – consumers are more informed by using digital sources to
find information on products before they buy. Competing firms’ websites,
friends on social media and customer feedback are all sources of
information used to inform purchasing decisions.New business formats – smaller innovative firms and large e-commerce
brands alike are changing what and how people buy.
FMCG manufacturers are aware of these disruptive challenges and how they
are affecting consumer demands. They are adapting their business models to be
more responsive and agile, finding ways to maintain a cost-focused approach
but at the same time becoming more transparent and innovative so they do not
miss niche market opportunities. This may mean FMCGs are able to challenge
firms that follow a differentiation focus strategy.
Differentiation focus
With this strategy, a firm aims to differentiate within one or a small number of
target market segments. The special needs of the segment mean there is an
opportunity to differentiate the product offering from that of the competition,
which may be targeting a broader group of customers. For example, some
small speciality chemical firms thrive on taking orders that are too small or
specialized to be of interest to their larger competitors. Differentiation focusers
must be clear that the needs of their target group differ from those of the
broader market (otherwise there will be no basis for differentiation) and that
existing competitors are underperforming.
Examples of brands with a differentiation focus are Burberry, Mercedes
and Ferrari, each of which markets differentiated products to one or a small
number of target market segments.
Cost focus
With this strategy, a firm seeks a cost advantage with one or a small number of
target market segments. By dedicating itself to the segment, the cost focuser
can seek economies that may be ignored or missed by broadly targeted
competitors. In some instances, the competition, by trying to achieve wide
market acceptance, may be over-performing (for example, by providing
unwanted services) to one segment of customers. By providing a basic product
offering, a cost advantage will be gained that may exceed the price discount
necessary to sell it. Examples of cost focusers are easyJet and Ryanair, which
focus on short-haul flights with a basic product trimmed to reduce costs. Lidl
is also a cost focuser, targeting price-sensitive consumers with a narrow
product line (around 1,500 items in stock), but with large buying power. Ibis,page 731
the no-frills hotel brand in the Accor Hotels portfolio, is another example, with
its focus on one market segment: price-conscious consumers.
Choosing a competitive strategy
The essence of corporate success is to choose a generic strategy and pursue it
with passion. Below-average performance is associated with the failure to
achieve any of these generic strategies. The result is no competitive advantage:
a stuck-in-the-middle position that results in lower performance than that of the
cost leaders, differentiators or focusers in any market segment. An example of
a firm that made the mistake of moving to a stuck-in-the-middle position is
Fiat. The Fiat 500 was sold in the US through a stand-alone dealership
network. Dealers were required to make a heavy investment in creating an
‘Italian feel’ in their showrooms. This was in preference to launching the car
through the 500-strong Chrysler dealers (Chrysler acquired a stake in Fiat in
2009). The advantages of the first option were an image of
exclusivity, but heavy investment was required (e.g. $3 million for
the showroom makeover). In the second option, leveraging advantage from
Chrysler could have meant making use of existing sales and service
infrastructures (Wunker 2012). One of the downsides was that the Fiat 500 had
a higher ticket price than similar-performing cars like the Nissan Versa and
Toyota Yaris, and being sold in the same location could have had a negative
impact on sales. So the Fiat 500 was, arguably, stuck in the middle, and its
strategy did not lead to the coverage needed to establish the brand as rapidly as
it would have liked. Sales in the US have continued to be challenging, as the
car has a relatively high price, less functionality and does not offer similar
value to competing brands (McIntyre 2018).
Firms need to understand the generic basis for their success and resist the
temptation to blur strategy by making inconsistent moves. For example, a no￾frills cost leader or focuser should beware the pitfalls of moving to a higher
cost base (perhaps by adding expensive services). A focus strategy involves
limiting sales volume. Once domination of the target segment has been
achieved, there may be a temptation to move into other segments to achieve
growth with the same competitive advantage. This can be a mistake if the new
segments do not value the firm’s competitive advantage in the same way.
In most situations, differentiation and cost leadership strategies are
incompatible: differentiation is achieved through higher costs. However, there
are circumstances when both can be achieved simultaneously. For example, adifferentiation strategy may lead to market share domination, which lowers
costs through economies of scale and learning effects; or a highly
differentiated firm may pioneer a major process innovation that significantly
reduces manufacturing costs, leading to a cost-leadership position. When
differentiation and cost leadership coincide, performance is exceptional since a
premium price can be charged for a low-cost product.
Sources of competitive advantage
Management can benefit by analysing the superior skills and resources
contributing to, or that could potentially contribute to, a marketing strategy for
creating sustainable competitive advantage. Sources of competitive advantage
include:
Superior skills: These are the distinctive management and staff capabilities
that set firms apart. The benefit of identifying and nurturing superior skills is
the ability to perform functions more effectively than competitors. For
example, Sergey Brin and Larry Page worked together to produce a search
engine that outperformed its rivals. Their technical know-how enabled them
to use their superior skills not only to create Google, but also to lead the
firm to become the world’s most influential digital search tool and global
digital brand.
Superior resources: These are the tangible requirements for advantage that
enable a firm to exercise its skills. Barney (1991) suggested a firm’s
resources are firm attributes, advertising and communications assets,
distribution infrastructure, R&D, scale of and type of production facilities,
financial resources, information and knowledge. He identified four
conditions that could be leveraged to create competitive advantage: value,
rareness, inability to be imitated and non-substitutable (VRIN). L’Oréal is
deploying its resources to develop a technology-first business. Its products,
communications, R&D, information and infrastructure are leveraging
advantage by developing valuable and rare firm attributes, which are
difficult to imitate and also are not easy to substitute.
Core competences: A firm’s distinctive skills and resources make up its core
competences. For example, Google can use its technical skills and vast
resources to enable the firm to operate a global search engine. Google
holding company Alphabet’s operation has grown in part due to its
responsiveness to change, innovative use of technology, its skills and thepage 732
deployment of data centres in the US, Northern Europe and Asia, making it
the dominant market leader in search engines globally.
Technology capabilities: These have become increasingly important.
Hoffman (2000) examined competitive advantage in relation to the internet.
Bhatt and Grover (2005) identified specific types of IT capabilities
contributing to competitive advantage: IT infrastructure, IT business
experience, digital relationships and organizational learning. Huang et al.
(2015) highlighted if a firm can create a strong market position it is able to
maintain, then this can lead to sustained competitive advantage – something
the big technology brands ‘FAANG’ (Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Apple,
Netflix and Google/Alphabet) have succeed in achieving.
Corporate culture: Firms do not operate in a vacuum but must respond to
the market environment and societal norms if they are to succeed (Nayak et
al. 2022). This means it is important to identify factors that contribute to
competitive advantage, such as reputation, knowledge resources, service
processes, management policies and procedures (Bharadwaj et al. 1993).
Jayashankar et al. (2020) also discovered the importance of
integrating the development of individuals and creating social
competitive advantage, giving firms scope to look inwards at employees and
outwards towards changing societal values. The involvement of individuals
is also becoming increasingly important (Porter and Kramer 2019).
Dynamic capabilities: Zhou and Li (2010) focused on the need to adopt a
strategic orientation to bring together a firm’s capabilities in a planning
framework that could respond to the dynamics of the marketing
environment. Figure 18.5 shows sources of competitive advantage and the
following section explores strategic approaches.
Creating a Differential Advantage
Although skills and resources are the sources of competitive advantage, they
are translated into a differential advantage only when the customer perceives
that the firm is providing value above that of the competition. (For methods of
calculating value in organizational markets, see Anderson and Narus (1998).)
The creation of a differential advantage comes from linking skills and
resources with the key attributes (choice criteria) that customers are looking
for in a product offering. However, it should be recognized that thedistinguishing competing attributes in a market are not always the most
important ones. For example, if customers were asked to rank safety,
punctuality and on-board service in order of importance when flying, safety
would undoubtedly be ranked at the top. Nevertheless, when choosing an
airline, safety would rank low because most airlines are assumed to be safe.
Therefore, airlines look to less important ways of differentiating their offerings
(e.g. giving superior on-board service).
A differential advantage can be created with any aspect of the marketing
and service mix (see Chapter 11 for more detailed discussion of services and
potential sources of differential advantage). Product, distribution, promotion
and price are all capable of creating added customer value (see Figure 18.6 and
Table 18.2).

The key to knowing whether improving an aspect of marketing is
worthwhile is to know whether the potential benefit provides value to the
customer. Table 18.2 lists ways of creating differential advantages and their
potential impact on customer value.
Product
Product performance can be enhanced by, say, raising speed, comfort and
safety levels, capacity and ease of use, or improving taste or smell. For
example, improving comfort levels (e.g. of a car), taste (e.g. of food) or smell
(e.g. of cosmetics) can give added pleasure to consumption. There are many
ways to enhance performance. For example, Apple enhanced the performance
of its iPhone with the creation of its App Store, allowing users to access
software applications from independent developers. This created additional
functions the iPhone can carry out. However, Google Play now has its own app
store to compete with Apple’s so this is no longer a source of differential
advantage. Foursquare City Guide allows users to find the location, price range
and reviews of restaurants nearby. For further discussion of marketing apps,
see Marketing in Action 18.1.
Exclusive designs and style are another way in which products can be used
to differentiate a brand. Manufacturers Bang & Olufsen and Audi are two firms
that have used style to compete in highly competitive markets. Bang &
Olufsen has long been regarded as the style leader in audio and television
equipment, and Audi has become one of the car industry’s most successful
luxury brands, producing some of the world’s most coveted and copied cars.
Apple Inc. has become a world-leading brand by continually introducing
innovative products, the latest being the Apple Watch. Many variations are
available, and design performance is constantly upgraded to ensure the product
retains its high-status market position. The Series 7 has added functions and
health features, faster charging and a larger screen, which create extra benefits
for customers.
The durability of a product has a bearing on costs, since greater durability
means a longer operating life. Improving product reliability (i.e. lowering
malfunctions or defects) can lower maintenance and production costs, raisepage 734
revenues through reduced downtime and lessen the hassle of using the product.
Product styling can also give customers value through the improved looks that
good styling brings. This can confer status to the buyer and allow the supplier
to charge premium prices, for example tyre manufacturers Bridgestone
(Japanese), Michelin (French) and Pirelli (Italian). The Apple MacBook Pro
and MacBook Air laptops demonstrate how style can be used to create a
differential advantage.
The capacity to upgrade a product (to take advantage of technological
advances) or to meet changing needs (e.g. extra storage space in a computer)
can lower costs and confer prestige by maintaining state-of-the-art features.
Products can be augmented by the provision of guarantees that give
customers peace of mind and lower costs should the product need repair, as
well as giving technical assistance to customers, so they are
provided with better-quality products. Both parties benefit from
closer relationships and from the provision of product installation, which
means customers do not incur problems in properly installing a complex piece
of equipment.
Distribution
Wide distribution coverage and/or careful selection of distributor locations can
provide convenient purchasing for customers. Quick and/or reliable delivery
can lower buyer costs by reducing production downtime and lowering
inventory levels. Reliable delivery reduces the frustration of waiting for late
deliveries. Providing distributors with support in the form of training and
financial help can bring about more effective selling and marketing, and it
offers both parties the advantage of closer relationships. Working with
organizational customers to introduce digital replenishment systems can lower
their costs, reduce their workload and increase the cost for them of switching
to other suppliers.
Third-party logistics firm DHL made a game-changing adjustment to its
logistical operations to help retailers get large appliances and items of heavy
furniture to customers’ homes. It introduced two-person delivery services,
which not only helped to streamline processes but also improved levels of
service and customer satisfaction (Hartshorne 2017).
PromotionA differential advantage can be generated by the creative use of advertising.
For example, spending more on advertising can also aid differentiation by
engendering a stronger brand personality than that of competitive brands. For
example, Amazon Prime, which provides preferential delivery and video￾streaming services to paying members, uses online and TV advertising to
differentiate the brand. Linked to its annual promotional events, such as
Amazon Prime Day, Digital Day and Black Friday, Prime also uses sales
promotions, direct marketing and other forms of digital marketing
communications techniques to drive sales and brand awareness.
Similarly, using more creative sales promotional methods or simply
spending more on sales incentives can give direct added value to customers.
By engaging in cooperative promotions with distributors, producers can lower
their costs and build goodwill. The sales force can also offer a means of
creating a differential advantage. Particularly when products are similar, a
well-trained sales force can provide superior problem-solving skills for
customers.
Price
Using low price as a means of gaining differential advantage can fail unless the
firm enjoys a cost advantage and has the resources to fight a price war. For
example, budget airlines such as Ryanair and easyJet have challenged more
traditional airlines by charging low prices based on low costs. Discount
retailers Aldi and Lidl have successfully used price to gain market share from
leading supermarket brands. A less obvious means of lowering the effective
price to the customer is to offer credit facilities or low-interest loans. Both
serve to lower the cost of purchase and improve cash flow for customers.
Finally, a high price can be used as part of a premium positioning strategy
to support brand image. Where a brand has distinct product, promotional or
distributional advantages, a premium price provides consistency within the
marketing mix. Louis Vuitton maintains high prices across its ranges to give a
consistent message of the value and quality of its products and designs. The
pricing policies of luxury brands seek to achieve a balance between
accessibility and exclusivity. Bulgari and Hermès maintain high-level entry
prices, targeting customers with very high levels of disposable income. Chanel,
Dior, Burberry, Tiffany and Vera Wang have a slightly different approach,
having slightly lower entry price products to enable wider diffusion of the
brands (Wealth-X 2018).page 735
This analysis of how the marketing mix can be used to develop a
differential advantage has focused on how each action can be translated into
value to the customer. Remember, however, that for a differential advantage to
be realized, a firm needs to provide not only customer value but also value that
is superior to that offered by the competition. If all firms provide distributor
support in equal measure, for example, distributors may gain value, but no
differential advantage will have been achieved.
In addition to using the marketing mix to create a differential advantage,
many firms are recognizing the need to create fast reaction times to changes in
marketing trends. For example, H&M and Zara have developed fast-reaction
systems so new designs can be delivered to stores within three weeks, top￾selling items are requested and poor sellers are withdrawn from shops within a
week. This is made possible by sophisticated marketing information systems
that feed data from stores to headquarters every day.
Firms can also create a differential advantage when the scale of their
operations creates value for their customers. For example, eBay has built a
sustainable differential advantage by building a large participant base. As the
customer value of an auction site is directly related to the size of the
participant base, once eBay gained a large user-base advantage it became
extremely difficult for any competitor to duplicate the value it offers (Nagle
and Hogan 2006).
Sustaining a differential advantage
When searching for ways to achieve a differential advantage, management
should pay close attention to factors that cannot easily be copied by the
competition, in a similar manner to when creating competitive advantage.
Competing on low price can often be copied by competitors, meaning the
advantage is short-lived. The key to achieving a long-term advantage is to
focus on areas that the competition finds impossible or, at the very least, very
difficult to copy, including:
patent-protected products
strong brand personality
close relationships with customershigh service levels achieved by well-trained personnel
innovative product upgrading
high entry barriers (e.g. R&D or promotional expenditures)
strong and distinctive internal processes that deliver the above and are
difficult to copy
scale (where the scale of operations provides value to the customer, e.g.
eBay) (De Chernatony et al. 2000).
Creating Cost Leadership
Creating a cost-leadership position requires an understanding of the factors
that affect costs. Porter has identified 10 major cost drivers that determine the
behaviour of costs in the value chain (see Figure 18.7) (Porter 1985).
FIGURE 18.7
Cost drivers
Economies of scalepage 736
Scale economies can arise from the use of more efficient methods of
production at higher volumes. For example, United Biscuits benefits from
more efficient machinery that can produce biscuits more cheaply than that used
by Fox’s Biscuits, which operates at much lower volume. Scale economies
also arise from the less-than-proportional increase in overheads as production
volume increases. For example, a factory with twice the floor area of another
factory costs less than twice the price to build. A third scale economy results
from the capacity to spread the cost of R&D and promotion over a greater
sales volume. Such scale economies mean that firms such as Coca-Cola,
General Electric, Intel, Microsoft and Walmart have a huge advantage over
their competitors. However, economies of scale do not proceed indefinitely. At
some point, diseconomies of scale are likely to arise as size gives rise to over￾complexity and, possibly, personnel difficulties.
Learning
Costs can also fall because of the effects of learning. For example, people learn
how to assemble more quickly, pack more efficiently, design products that are
easier to manufacture, lay out warehouses more effectively, cut
driving time and reduce inventories. The combined effect of
economies of scale and learning as cumulative output increases has been
termed the experience curve. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has
estimated that costs are reduced by approximately 15–20 per cent on average
each time cumulative output doubles. This suggests firms with greater market
share will have a cost advantage through the experience curve effect, assuming
all firms are operating on the same curve. However, a move towards a new
manufacturing technology can lower the experience curve for adopting firms,
allowing them to leapfrog more traditional firms and thereby gain a cost
advantage even though cumulative output may be lower.
Capacity utilization
Since fixed costs must be paid whether a plant is manufacturing at full or zero
capacity, underutilization incurs costs. The effect is to push up the cost per unit
for production. The impact of capacity utilization on profitability was
established by the PIMS (profit impact of marketing strategy) studies, which
have shown a positive association between utilization and return on investment
(Buzzell and Gale 1987). Changes in capacity utilization can also raise costs(e.g. through the extra costs of hiring and laying off workers). Careful
production planning is required for seasonal products, such as ice cream and
fireworks, to smooth output.
Linkages
These describe how the costs of activities are affected by how other activities
are performed. For example, improving quality-assurance activities can reduce
after-sales service costs. In the car industry, a reduction in the number of faults
on a new car decreases warranty costs. The activities of suppliers and
distributors also link to affect the costs of a firm. For example, the introduction
of a just-in-time delivery system by a supplier reduces the inventory costs of a
firm. Distributors can influence a firm’s physical distribution costs through
their warehouse location decision. To exploit such linkages, though, the firm
may need considerable bargaining power. In some instances, it can pay a firm
to increase distributor margins or pay a fee in order to exploit linkages.
Interrelationships
Sharing costs with other business units is another potential cost driver. Sharing
the costs of R&D, transportation, marketing and purchasing means lower
costs. Know-how can also be shared to reduce costs by improving the
efficiency of an activity. Car manufacturers share engineering platforms and
components to reduce costs. For example, Volkswagen does this across its VW,
Škoda, SEAT and Audi cars. Care must be taken that the cars appearing under
different brand names do not appear too similar, however, or this may detract
from the appeal of the more expensive marques (MacKintosh 2005).
Integration
Both integration and forms of integration can affect costs. For example,
owning the means of physical distribution rather than using outside contractors
could lower costs. Ownership may allow a producer to avoid suppliers or
customers with sizeable bargaining power. De-integration can lower costs and
raise flexibility. For example, by using many small clothing suppliers, Inditex
brand Zara is in a powerful position to keep costs low while maintaining a high
degree of production flexibility through its integrated supply network of
factories in Europe, Africa and Asia.page 737
Timing
Both first movers and late entrants have potential opportunities for lowering
costs. First movers in a market can gain cost advantages: it is usually cheaper
to establish a brand name in the minds of customers if there is no competition.
Also, they have prime access to cheap or high-quality raw materials and
locations. However, late entrants to a market can buy the latest technology and
avoid high market development costs.
Policy decisions
Firms have a wide range of discretionary policy decisions that affect costs.
Product width, level of service, channel decisions (e.g. small number of large
dealers versus large number of small dealers), sales force decisions
(e.g. in-firm sales force versus sales agents) and wage levels are
some of the decision areas that have a direct impact on costs. Southwest
Airlines, for example, cuts costs by refusing to waste time assigning seats and
does not wait for late arrivals. The overriding concern is to get the plane in and
out of the gate quickly, so it is in the air earning money. Southwest flies only
one kind of aircraft, the Boeing 737 MAX, which means it can focus its
training efforts and in doing so maintain a low-cost base (Southwest 2021).
Firms can also collaborate to reduce costs. For example, Vodafone has
teamed up with O2
 to share mobile network infrastructure (e.g. masts,
equipment and power supply) in a billion-pound deal to speed up network roll￾out and keep up with competitor British Telecom (Williams 2018).
Ryanair accepts bookings via digital channels, eliminating the need for an
inbound telemarketing team, and uses digital e-ticketing to further reduce
costs. Other sectors, such as insurance, rail, banking, package holidays and
hotels, encourage transactions over the internet to reduce costs. Care must be
taken, however, not to reduce costs around activities that have a major bearing
on customer value. For example, moving from a firm-employed sales force to
sales agents may not only cut costs but at the same time also destroy supplier–
customer relationships.
Supply and distributionWith global supply chain networks, the movement of goods around the world
is much faster and easily scalable. Fast time to market is very important in the
digital age, and goods can be transported on an on-demand basis, but there are
high costs to consider. It is important to ensure manufacturing processes and
resources are streamlined so goods are available when required, which
involves detailed forecasting of product demand. Galfeter supplies speciality
paper and engineering products on a global basis, and it cut the time to market
by 25 per cent by using digital decision-making systems. This, in turn, enabled
the firm to get ahead of its competitors (Sopheon 2018). Being close to the
point of consumption can also bring benefits. Coca-Cola’s bottled water brand,
Dasani, is bottled in close proximity to consumer markets, giving cost
advantages from its logistical operations. Locating near customers can lower
outbound distributional costs, while locating near suppliers reduces inbound
distributional costs.
Institutional factors
Institutional factors include government regulations, tariffs and local content
rules. For example, regulations regarding the maximum size of lorries affect
distribution costs. Businesses based in the UK are facing complex tariff
barriers on the movement of goods since leaving the EU and new trade rules
imposed since Brexit.
Firms employing a cost leadership strategy will be vigilant in pruning
costs. This analysis of cost drivers provides a framework for searching out new
avenues for cost reduction.
Once a firm has identified a strategic direction and developed an
understanding of the nature of the competition and how it might compete, it
must then decide on developing a competitive marketing strategy.
Competitive Marketing Strategy
When developing a marketing strategy, firms need to be aware of their own
strengths and weaknesses, customer needs and the competition. This three￾pronged approach to strategy development has been termed the ‘strategic
triangle’ and is shown in Figure 18.8. This framework recognizes that to bepage 738
successful it is no longer enough to be good at satisfying customers’ needs;
firms need to be better than the competition.
FIGURE 18.8
The strategic triangle
So far, we have considered creating and sustaining competitive advantage;
now we explore the development of marketing strategies in the face of
competitive activity and challenges by looking at alternative modes of
competitive behaviour, and then we examine when and how to achieve
strategic marketing objectives.
Competitive Behaviour
Rivalry between firms does not always lead to conflict and aggressive
marketing battles. Competitive behaviour can take five forms: conflict,
competition, coexistence, cooperation and collusion (Easton and Araujo 1986).
Conflict
Conflict is characterized by aggressive competition, where the objective is to
drive competitors out of the marketplace. The retail industry is highly
competitive. Compounded by the global economic recession, many businesseshave been forced to close because of competitive conflict, or to devise ways of
strengthening their market position.
Competition
The objective of competition is not to eliminate competitors from the
marketplace but to perform better than them. This may take the form of trying
to achieve faster sales and/or profit growth, larger size or higher market share.
Competitor reaction will be an important consideration when setting strategy
and one should also consider the level of aggression with which the competitor
will respond. Players will avoid spoiling the underlying industry structure,
which is an important influence on overall profitability. For example, price
wars will be avoided if competitors believe their long-term effect will be to
reduce industry profitability.
Coexistence
Three types of coexistence can occur. First, coexistence may arise because
firms do not recognize their competitors, owing to difficulties in defining
market boundaries. For example, Waterman and Montblanc, makers of fine￾quality and luxury writing instruments, fountain pens and propelling pencils,
may ignore competition from jewellery firms, since their definition may be
product-based rather than market-centred (i.e. the gift market). Second, firms
may not recognize other firms they believe are operating in a separate market
segment. For example, Montblanc and Waterman are likely to ignore the
actions of Mitsubishi Pencil Firm, which manufactures Uniball rollerball pens,
as the firms are operating in different market segments. Third, firms may
choose to acknowledge the territories of their competitors (for example,
geography, brand personality, market segment or product technology) to avoid
harmful head-to-head competition.
Cooperation
This involves the pooling of the skills and resources of two or more firms to
overcome problems and take advantage of new opportunities. A growing trend
is towards strategic alliances, where firms join through a joint venture,
licensing agreement, long-term purchasing and supply arrangements, or a joint
R&D contract to build a long-term competitive advantage. For example, Shellpage 739
International Petroleum, Rolls-Royce and Airbus have worked in collaboration
to develop alternative fuels for the A380, which has led to the use of cleaner
aviation fuels. In today’s global marketplace, where size is a key source of
advantage, cooperation is a major type of competitive behaviour (Airbus
2012). Read Mini Case 18.1 to find out more about the Diageo way of growing
markets.
Collusion
The final form of competitive behaviour is collusion, whereby firms come to
some arrangement that inhibits competition in a market. Collusion is more
likely where there are a small number of suppliers in each national market, the
price of the product is a small proportion of buyer costs, cross-national trade is
restricted by tariff barriers or prohibitive transportation costs, and buyers can
pass on high prices to their customers. For example, Apple joined forces with
five major book publishers (Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins, Penguin,
Simon & Schuster and Macmillan) to raise the price of e-books. The US
Justice Department and the European Commission decided that Apple’s
decision to side with the publishers was tantamount to collusion and an
example of anticompetitive behaviour. The publishers settled, but Apple went
to trial and was found guilty of price fixing and collusion (Hughes 2014).
MINI CASE 18.1
Growing Markets the Diageo WaySource: erdemlis/Shutterstock
Diageo is a firm that owns more than a quarter of the world’s leading brands of spirits, for
example Smirnoff vodka, Johnnie Walker whisky and Guinness, which is a leading global
beer brand. In addition, Diageo also owns local brands, which are used to broaden market
penetration in parts of the world. For Diageo, growth opportunities are in new markets in
Asia Pacific, Latin America and Africa, and the firm is making acquisitions of strong local
brands that appeal to its target customers.
Diageo’s strategies for winning market share make use of the firm’s marketing knowledge
and expertise. Elements of the marketing mix are used innovatively to differentiate its
brands, for example the global Johnnie Walker ‘Keep walking’ marketing communications
campaign, which has increased sales and market share for over a decade. This creative
idea has grown and been reinvented for a new generation of digital consumers. Products
also undergo regular reinvention, and new flavours, packaging and formats are introduced
to ensure the interest of new and existing customers, for example the ‘From the bar’
premixed drinks range using Gordon’s, Pimm’s and Smirnoff.
Collaboration with partners is another method used by Diageo to build market share. The
firm’s ‘Diageo way of selling’ programme aims to help retailers and other trade partners
achieve high levels of sales through education and sharing best practices, which creates
value for all involved in the collaboration. Diageo has made a significant investment in
facilitating partnerships. Its European Customer Collaboration Centre provides a state-of￾the-art facility for Diageo to bring together customers, retailers, trade partners and
distributors to aid brand development, integrated planning and R&D for new products and
services. This investment not only helps Diageo show support to its business partners and
customers, but also to foster constant brand development and innovation, which ultimately
increases sales and growth of market share.
Recently, Diageo acquired Belsazar, a German aperitif, through its Distill Ventures
programme, which aims to accelerate business growth, support entrepreneurs and build
global brands from the ground up. Diageo provides the funding and business support; the
entrepreneurs do the rest.page 740

1. Explain the actions Diageo has used to build market share.
2. Discuss the difference between strategic thrust and strategic objectives, using
examples from Diageo.
3. Discuss the importance of setting marketing objectives as part of the marketing
planning process.

Developing Competitive Marketing
Strategies
Researchers Ries and Trout (2005) and Kotler and Singh (1981) have drawn
attention to the relationship between military and marketing ‘warfare’. Their
work has stressed the need to develop strategies that are more than customer
based. They placed the emphasis on attacking and defending against the
competition and used military analogies to guide strategic thinking. They saw
competition as the enemy and thus recognized the relevance to business of the
principles of military warfare as put forward by such writers as Sun Tzu (1963)
and von Clausewitz (2007). As von Clausewitz wrote:
[Military warfare] is a conflict of great interests which is settled by
bloodshed, and only in that is it different from others. It would be
better, instead of comparing it with any Art, to liken it to business
competition, which is also a conflict of human interests and activities.
Earlier in the chapter we discussed analysing competitors and their
marketing objectives, which shape their direction in terms of products and
markets and, more specifically, objectives for individual products and services.
We now consider the marketing strategies that firms might apply when
pursuing strategic marketing objectives.Attack and defence strategies
Attack strategies
If a market cannot be expanded, a build strategy implies gaining marketing
success at the expense of the competition. Winning market share is an
important goal, as market share has been found in many studies to be related to
profitability (see Chapter 11). There are several reasons why this should be.
Market leaders are often high-price brands (e.g. Coca-Cola, Kellogg’s, Heinz,
Nestlé and Nike). They are also in a stronger position to resist distributor
demands for trade discounts. Because of economies of scale and experience
curve effects, market leaders’ costs are likely to be lower than those of their
smaller-volume rivals. Therefore, market leaders’ profit margins should be
greater than those of their competitors. Since they are market leaders, the unit
sales volume is higher and consequently their overall profits (profit margin ×
sales volume) should be higher than those of their rivals. Therefore, firms such
as GE, Unilever, Procter & Gamble and Heinz are willing to compete only in
those markets where they can reach number one or two position. Although, as
markets become more dynamic and consumer tastes change, FMCG
manufacturers can also extend brand portfolios through acquisition of smaller
potential competitors. For example, L’Oréal acquired Byredo, a luxury
fragrance brand founded in Sweden (Ahssen 2022).
Firms seek to win market share through product, distribution, promotional
innovation and penetration pricing. Kotler and Singh (1981) have identified
five competitor confrontation strategies designed to win sales and market share
(see Table 18.3).
TABLE 18.3 Competitor confrontation strategies designed to win sales and market shareFrontal attack A frontal attack involves the market challenger taking
on the defender head-on.
The challenger should have a clear and sustainable
competitive advantage. If the advantage is based on
cost leadership, this will support a low-price strategy to
fight the market leader. Success is more likely if there is
some restriction on the leader’s ability to retaliate, for
example through patent protection, which can make it
difficult for the market leader. However, the challenger
needs adequate resources to withstand any battle that
occurs should the leader decide to retaliate. See Table
18.4 for examples of brands involved in major marketing
head-on battles.
Flanking Involves attacking unguarded or weakly guarded ground
– in marketing terms, attacking geographical areas or
market segments where the defender is poorly
represented. The advantage of a flanking attack is that
it does not provoke the same kind of response as a
head-on confrontation.
Since the defender is not challenged in its main market
segments, there is more chance that it will ignore the
challenger’s initial successes. If the defender dallies too
long, the flank segment can be used as a beachhead
from which to attack the defender in its major markets.
Encirclement Encirclement involves attacking the defender from all
sides. Every market segment is hit with every
combination of product features to completely encircle
the defender. Seiko produces 2,000-plus watch designs
for the worldwide market. Its range includes watches
with quartz, kinetic, solar and mechanical movements in
a very wide range of styles to suit every customer taste.
A variant on the encirclement attack approach is to cut
off supplies to the defender. This could be achieved by
the acquisition of major supply firms.
Bypass Circumvents the defender’s position. This type of attack
changes the rules of the game, usually through
technological leapfrogging. A bypass attack can also be
accomplished through diversification. An attacker can
bypass a defender by seeking growth in new markets
with new products.Guerrilla Hurts the defender with pin pricks rather than blows.
Unpredictable price discounts, sales promotions or
heavy advertising in a few television regions are some of
the tactics attackers can use to cause problems for
defenders. Guerrilla attack tactics may be the only
feasible option for a small firm facing a larger competitor.
Such tactics allow the small firm to make its presence
felt without the dangers of a full-frontal attack. By being
unpredictable, guerrilla activity is difficult to defend
against. Nevertheless, the defender may choose to
retaliate with a full-frontal attack if sufficiently provoked.
BarkBox, an innovative digital subscription service for
dog foods and toys, entered the highly lucrative pet
product industry in the US, which is dominated by Mars
Petcare, with a service designed to make dogs happier.
Linked with social media, the brand has a highly creative
social media team, more than 6 million followers on
Facebook and in excess of 500,000 subscribers, and
has seen sales increase to turnover in excess of $100
million (Berthene 2018).

competitive confrontation.

Defence strategies
In circumstances where there is rivalry among competitors, strategic action
may be required to defend sales and market share from aggressive challenges.The principles of defensive warfare provide a framework for identifying
strategic alternatives that can be used in this situation. Table 18.5 illustrates six
methods of defence derived from military strategy.
TABLE 18.5 Defence strategies
Position Position defence involves building a fortification around a
firm’s existing territory, reflecting the philosophy that the
firm has good products and all that is needed is to price
them competitively and promote them effectively. This is
more likely to work if the products have differential
advantages that are not easily copied, for example
through patent protection. Marketing assets such as brand
names and reputation may also provide a strong defence
against aggressors.
Flanking Flanking defence is characterized by the defence of a
hitherto unprotected market segment.
The danger is that if the segment is left unprotected, it will
provide a beachhead for new entrants to gain experience
in the market and attack the main market later. This means
if it helps to avoid or slow down competitive inroads, it can
make sense to a defender to compete in a segment that,
in short-term profitability terms, looks unattractive.
Mobile When a firm’s major market is under threat, a mobile
defence may make strategic sense. The two options are
diversification and market broadening. FMCG brands
protect their key markets. For example, Unilever produces
Hellman’s Mayonnaise, but has recognized the demand
for plant-based products, so has diversified by adding
vegan and vegetarian options, and has also acquired The
Vegetarian Butcher to broaden its markets (Unilever
2022).
Counter￾offensive
A defender can choose from three options when
considering a counter-offensive defence. It can embark
on a head-on counter-attack, hit the attacker’s cash cow or
encircle the attacker. With a head-on counter-attack, a
defender matches or exceeds what the attacker has done.
This may involve heavy price-cutting or promotion
expenditure, for example. This can be a costly operation
but may be justified to deter a persistent attacker. This
strategy was used by Smirnoff vodka when the brand was
attacked by German vodka brand Wolfschmidt in the US.
Smirnoff owner Heublein Inc. did not want to enter a price
war so counter-attacked by releasing Popov, a cheaper
equivalent. Wolfschmidt was attacked on both sides
(Thomas 2019).page 741
page 742
Preemptive Preemptive defence follows the philosophy that the best
form of defence is to attack first. This may involve
continuous innovation and new product development. For
example, Apple Inc. invests heavily in design and
innovation. Failure to maintain the ability to lead the
market could result in loss of market share and eventual
collapse of the brand.
Strategic
withdrawal
Strategic withdrawal is when a market exit strategy
requires a firm to define its strengths and weaknesses and
then to hold on to its strengths while divesting its
weaknesses. This results in the firm concentrating on its
core business. An example is Diageo, which withdrew
from the fast-food business by selling Burger King and
from food by selling Pillsbury to concentrate on premium
drinks.
Source: based on Kotler and Singh (1981); Varadarajan (2010)
Working together in competitive markets
When firms are trading in intensely competitive markets, there is a likelihood
they will interact through attacking and defending market territories. However,
in increasingly turbulent and changing markets, collaboration and cooperation
often occur. Marketing managers can find themselves considering whether to
compete or cooperate with firms that operate in similar market territories.
Collaborative networks of competing firms can develop based on shared
interests, with the aim of solving common problems (Meng and Layton 2011).
For example, Nissan, BMW and Tesla are rivals in the electronic car market,
but they have agreed to collaborate and share patents to speed up the
development of electric cars. Growth in this relatively new industry has been
slow, so by cooperating there is potential for all partners to benefit.
Adidas has joined with Parley for the Oceans (a movement raising
awareness of the plight of the oceans; visit www.parley.tv/#fortheoceans for
further details). This savvy partnership brings additional credibility for the
sportswear manufacturer’s new range of trainers made from reused plastic
waste gathered from the sea. Another collaboration sees McDonald’s offering
home delivery through its relationship with Uber Eats in the UK and US
(Hammett 2018).page 743
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapter Detailed Review
1. The determinants of industry attractiveness
Industry attractiveness is determined by the degree of rivalry between competitors,
the threat of new entrants, the bargaining power of suppliers and buyers, and the
threat of substitute products.page 744
2. How to analyse competitors
Competitor analysis should identify competitors (products from competitors,
product substitutes, generic competitors and potential new entrants); audit their
capabilities; analyse their objectives, strategic thrust and strategies; and estimate
competitor response patterns.
3. The difference between differentiation and cost leadership
strategies
Differentiation strategy involves the selection of one or more choice criteria used
by buyers to select suppliers/brands and uniquely positioning the supplier/brand to
meet those criteria better than the competition.
Cost leadership involves the achievement of the lowest cost position in an industry.
4. The sources of competitive advantage
Competitive advantage can be achieved by creating a differential advantage or
achieving the lowest cost position.
Its sources are superior skills, superior resources and core competences. A useful
method of locating superior skills and resources is value chain analysis.
5. The value chain
The value chain categorizes the value-creating activities of a firm. The value chain
divides these into primary and support activities. Primary activities are inbound
physical distribution, operations, outbound physical distribution, marketing and
service. Support activities are found within all of these primary activities and
consist of purchased inputs, technology, human resource management and the
firm’s infrastructure.
By examining each value-creating activity, management can search for the skills
and resources (and linkages) that may form the basis for low cost or differentiated
positions.
6. How to create and maintain a differential advantage
A differential advantage is created when the customer perceives that the firm is
providing value above that of the competition.
A differential advantage can be created using any element in the marketing mix:
superior product, more effective distribution, better promotion and better value for
money by lower prices, and value-added services. A differential advantage can
also be created by developing fast reaction times to changes in marketing trends.
A differential advantage can be maintained (sustained) through the use of patent
protection, strong brand personality, close relationships with customers, high
service levels based on well-trained staff, innovative product upgrading, the
creation of high entry barriers (e.g. R&D or promotional expenditures) and strong
and distinctive internal processes that deliver the earlier points and are difficult to
copy.
7. How to create and maintain a cost leadership position
Cost leadership can be created and maintained by managing cost drivers. These
cost drivers are economies of scale, learning effects, capacity utilization, linkages
(e.g. improvements in quality assurance can reduce after-sales service costs),
interrelationships (e.g. sharing costs), integration (e.g. owning the means ofpage 745
distribution), timing (both first movers and late entrants can have low costs), policy
decisions (e.g. controlling labour costs), location and institutional factors (e.g.
government regulations).
8. The nature of competitive behaviour
Competitive behaviour can take five forms: conflict, competition, coexistence,
cooperation and collusion.
9. Competitive marketing strategy can appear as a military initiative
Military analogies have been used in the past to guide strategic thinking, because
of the need to attack and defend against competition. While the underlying thinking
remains important, the language of war appears less in modern business-speak.
Attack strategies are the frontal attack, the flanking attack, encirclement, the
bypass attack and the guerrilla attack.
Defence strategies are the position defence, the flanking defence, the preemptive
defence, the counter-offensive defence, the mobile defence and strategic
withdrawal.

CASE 35
MASTERCARD’S SONIC
BRAND IDENTITY: A
SOUND STRATEGY
Mastercard dropped its name from its logo in 2019. The iconic red and yellow intersecting
circles of Mastercard now represent one of the world’s most recognized brands, joining a small
number of symbol brands that can rely on people recognizing their brand without the name
being written. The decision to drop the name from the logo was aimed squarely at devices such
as smartphones that have much smaller real estate, making colour and recognizable symbols
increasingly important.

The same year, Mastercard revealed its multi-layered sonic brand identity. As part of its brand
evolution, it will now brand with sound. The sonic identity is presented in the form of a unique
30-second melody, which is a piece of owned music made for, and owned by, the Mastercard
brand. The distinct and memorable Mastercard melody is described as the sonic DNA1 of the
brand and is the foundation of the company’s sound architecture. This melody will extend topage 750
many assets, and will be used in musical scores, as the background music in ads, as well as in
sponsorship activities and as hold music in call centres (Dooley 2021). The sonic logo
(Mastercard Engagement Bureau a), sonic signature or mnemonic is three seconds long and
will play whenever customers interact and engage with the Mastercard brand across the globe,
whether that is in physical, digital or voice environments. It is available as a ringtone if
customers wish to download it. The point-of-sale acceptance sound (Mastercard Engagement
Bureau b) is a ‘mogo’, or musical logo, that lasts for 1.3 seconds and will be used in situations
such as point-of-sale, both online and in-store. The Mastercard sonic identity has been
described as the sound equivalent of the company’s red and yellow circles. The sonic brand
architecture aims to keep ahead of consumer moves to devices such as voice assistants and
smart speakers, where there is no visual real estate available to the Mastercard brand.
Development and Activation
Mastercard conducted two years of research into how its brand might be translated into the
audio realm, working with artists, composers, musicologists and agencies. The sonic identity
has been designed to make the brand clearly recognizable at all consumer touchpoints, while
still offering the highest degree of flexibility when creating new music and sound assets
(Mastercard News 2019). The resulting melody can be adapted to work across genres and
cultures, facilitating regionally modified styles, while maintaining consistency in Mastercard’s
brand voice globally. A regionally modified version of the melody was launched in both Bogota
and Mumbai to appeal to local market aesthetics. Extensions to the original acceptance sound
that resonates at the point of sale have included sounds like paying for a taxi. There are also
contextually relevant executions such as cinematic and operatic versions.
The new sound identity first launched in the US at the start of February 2019 (Vizard 2019)
through a collaboration with singer Camila Cabello (Pop Data 2019) to coincide with the
Grammy Awards, which Mastercard sponsors. It was introduced to markets including Italy,
Germany and Spain, before it was brought to the UK for the 2019 Brit Awards, which
Mastercard also sponsors. Stretching the basic anthem into a content play, the financial
services enterprise used the 2020 Grammy Awards to introduce ‘Merry Go Round’, the first
song on a music album by Swedish artist Nadine Randle (Mastercard News 2020). That same
year, Mastercard urged soccer fans to join in a virtual version of a stadium wave on TikTok as
teams competed in the Mastercard-sponsored UEFA Champions League. When
TikTok users created a video while raising their arms from the bottom of a
smartphone screen to the top, digital confetti shaped like soccer balls and trophies fell across
the screen, integrating the sonic brand identity of Mastercard. Star players Fernando Torres and
Marcel Desailly also appeared in videos to urge others to participate in the challenge. In 2021,
viewers of the football competition Copa América were targeted with advertising using a custom
soundtrack integrating the Mastercard payment sound (Tidmarsh 2021).
The sonic logo was also integrated into a song featuring Jennifer Hudson (Mastercard 2021), to
celebrate businesses owned by black women as part of the brand’s $500 million pledge to help
close the racial wealth and opportunity gap for black communities and businesses across the
US. Mastercard released its first music album in June 2022. Priceless, available on Spotify,
features original songs by 10 artists from around the globe that incorporate the melody of
Mastercard’s brand sound. For the Priceless album, Mastercard collaborated with producer
Niclas Molinder (Szymkowski 2022) to find artists that span cultures, languages and genres
who could turn the chirps of Mastercard’s melody into songs. The album features artists from
the UK, Lebanon, Sweden, Colombia, Algeria, India, Australia, Slovenia and the US, giving it a
wide reach (Kelly 2022).Benefits of a Sound Strategy
Mastercard CMO Raja Rajamannar has championed the idea that ‘sounds add a powerful new
dimension to our brand identity and a critical component to how people recognize Mastercard
today and in the future. It is a powerful way for us to reach consumers through the passions
that connect us all’ (Mastercard News 2019; Minnock 2020). As a comprehensive sound
architecture with a distinct melody, the Mastercard sound identity aims to provide simple and
seamless familiarity for customers across physical, digital and voice payments (Linehan 2019).
Mastercard believes that this effective sonic branding can help to enhance brand attributes
such as differentiation, image and identity (Warc.com 2020). Strategic use of sonic messaging
can create emotional connectivity with consumers and strengthen their sense of belonging with
the brand (Warc.com 2020).
Greg Boosin, executive vice president, global business-to-business and product marketing at
Mastercard, suggests that ‘sonic brands appeal directly to your subconscious and they do that
through logos, music tracks, live music events, phone sounds and computer sounds … creating
brand recall’ (Warc.com 2020), and giving Mastercard instant brand recognition. Familiarity,
recognition and emotional connection are key outcomes for Mastercard, as Rajamannar notes:
‘the melody has to be simple, likeable, memorable because that’s how recognition happens,
and memorability happens when a melody is hummable by normal people, not classically￾trained musicians’ (Vizard 2019).
Mastercard is also keen to lean on its technological heritage – Apple is not a fruit, Amazon is
not a river and Mastercard is not a credit card company, one internal maxim goes – and it is
important to keep up this innovation. As a technology company, continuous innovation is critical
to Mastercard maintaining a strong brand. An innovative sonic identity strategy is a core tenet of
the brand’s identity and personality (Bourne 2019).
In June 2021, Mastercard held the number-one spot in sonic branding agency amp’s index of
the best audio brands (amp 2022). Visa was at number 39, HSBC at number 52 and American
Express at number 69 on the list (Tidmarsh 2021). Mastercard was ranked first by the agency
due to the brand’s unique holistic and DNA-based sonic identity, and its performance and
efficiency against a range of criteria including trust, recognition, efficiency and engagement.
Rajamannar suggests that Mastercard’s sonic identity stood out on the list compared with other
brands, ‘as it is one of the broadest, most comprehensive approaches to sonic branding that
there is today’ (Tidmarsh 2021).
The highest-climbing brand sector on the amp index was financial services, where HSBC,
American Express and J.P.Morgan all increased their rankings significantly. The report explains
that this was due largely to an increase in the use of customized audio by firms, and for HSBC
the full roll-out of its sonic identity, created in 2019, impacted its ranking significantly.
Mastercard’s sonic brand strategy is also an attempt to keep ahead of the move by consumers
to devices such as voice assistants and smart speakers, where there is no visual real estate for
the brand. Strong growth in app-based and contactless digital interactions has been evidenced
(Warc.com 2020), while consumption of on-demand audio content, including streamed music
and podcasts, is also increasing (Williams 2020). Voice shopping using Alexa, Google, Siri or
other assistants is set to become big business and is predicted to be worth £3.5 billion in the
UK alone by 2022 (Bourne 2019).
Payment security is another key reason for implementing the Mastercard sonic brand identity
(Bourne 2019). Normally when making an e-commerce payment the brand is visible, giving
customers a feeling of security. Once customers move to voice shopping, although they don’t
actually see what the device is doing, they still want that feeling of security. With Mastercard’s
sonic logo, customers know they are paying with Mastercard, they can hear it even if they can’tsee it (Bourne 2019). This desire for security was heightened during the period of page 751
the Covid-19 pandemic, with industry experts suggesting that circumstances
accelerated the importance of sound and voice as vital elements of the brand identity within the
customer experience toolbox (Warc.com 2020).
A Sound Future
The journey to make its sonic identity as recognizable as its visual identity, which 80 per cent of
consumers worldwide recognize, will be a long-term process. Operating in 210 countries,
dealing with approximately 50 million merchants and with a customer base of 1.8 billion around
the globe, it will take time for Mastercard’s sonic branding identity to become ubiquitous. As Raj
Rajamannar has stated, ‘this is a long-haul journey, it is not going to happen overnight. And we
are up to it’ (Vizard 2019).

CASE 36
COCA-COLA: CAN AN
ICONIC AMERICAN BRANDADAPT ITSELF TO THE
INDIAN MARKET?
While Coca-Cola is often thought of as being as American as baseball and apple pie, it is, in
reality, an international brand, immediately recognizable the world over. One of its most
important markets is India, where Coca-Cola is the largest producer of beverages, with a
reported 40 per cent market share in the branded beverage sector. Coca-Cola believes that the
Indian market is vital to the future success of the company, and hopes to make the country one
of the top three places where Coca-Cola does business (India is currently Coca-Cola’s fifth￾largest market). The company appears to be off to a good start. For the June quarter of 2022,
Coca-Cola announced it had its best results ever in India, with ‘1 billion incremental
transactions in the quarter’, which were mainly led by ‘affordable single serve packs’.

The Indian market for non-alcoholic beverages is one of the fastest growing on the planet.
Estimated to be worth US$8.69 billion in 2021, it is expected to reach a value of US$13.7 billion
by 2027, thanks to a forecast average annual growth rate of 8.10 per cent. It is believed much
of this growth will be driven by improving per capita incomes and changing consumer
behaviour.
But India has a relatively short cola history compared with the US. And, unlike in the United
States, where soda is often seen as an alternative to water, carbonated drinks are considered
to be somewhat of a luxury product in India, to be consumed only occasionally. It is in terms of
marketing, however, that the opportunity exists for companies to build a strong brand image
that consumers can identify with – that is, if they have the capacity to compete effectively in this
highly competitive and culturally diverse marketplace.
Today, India is seen as an attractive emerging market with a high potential for success, but that
was not always the case. In the 1970s, the country saw severe political upheaval, with a state
of emergency existing from 1975 to 1977. Turmoil, and a disadvantageous legal environment
for foreign multinationals, caused many large companies to leave India during this period,
Coca-Cola being one of them. The company would not have the courage to re-enter the Indian
beverage market again until 1993, after a 17-year absence.page 753
In terms of products, Coca-Cola offers a variety of drinks to quench the thirst of Indian
consumers: sparkling, hydration, fruit juices, tea and coffee, as well as sports drinks. The
company says its vision is to ‘craft products that people love, to refresh them in body and spirit’.
But the future of the non-alcoholic beverage market in India is expected to be dominated by
juices, with an anticipated drop-off in the importance of carbonated beverages. In 2021,
according to a report published by management consulting firm Technopak in association with
NASSCOM (India’s National Association of Software and Services Companies), the market for
packaged juices in India was worth US$200 million, with an annualized growth rate projected to
be 15 per cent over the next two years. The shift in market demand from carbonated drinks is
due to several factors – one is the increase in health consciousness on the part of many Indian
consumers (in part due to Covid-19) and another is the general increase in the affordability of
juices.
This trend is a cause of concern for Coca-Cola. Simply selling more fizzy drinks to thirsty Indian
consumers doesn’t seem to be a realistic option. Even more troubling, global tastes look as if
they are changing as well, putting pressure on Coca-Cola’s revenue. Since about
2002, carbonated drinks, as a percentage of revenue, have gone from 90 per cent
to approximately 70 per cent, and it is believed that by 2030 soda could make up only 50 per
cent of Coca-Cola’s sales. The company needs new products and new markets if it hopes to
survive, let alone thrive.
Competition is another serious problem facing Coca-Cola in India. Not only does the company
have to deal with its arch-nemesis Pepsi, it is also being seriously challenged by a relatively
new Indian start-up called Hector Beverages. In an ironic twist of fate, Hector Beverages was
founded in 2010 by a former Coca-Cola executive, Neeraj Kakkar.
An Indian David Takes on an Atlanta Giant
While its first product was an energy drink, Hector Beverages’ flagship brand is its Paper Boat
line of ‘ethnic’, or traditional, drinks. This segment, according to Wazir Advisors, a consultancy,
is estimated to be worth as much as US$250 million, and Paper Boat is already the market
leader, with a broad array of different flavours for people to choose from. Mr Kakkar is
passionate about the ethnic drinks market, saying, ‘At Hector Beverages, we believe that if we
don’t do something now, these recipes will disappear in the next 20 to 30 years.’
Historically speaking, the ethnic beverage market in India was highly unorganized, primarily
being the domain of street vendors; in addition, people prepared such drinks at home. The
genius of Hector Beverages was to come up with a pre-packaged and ready-to-drink format for
beloved traditional drinks. Furthermore, Hector Beverages has been able to readily penetrate
urban markets and increase production as demand has increased.
The idea to sell ethnic beverages came to the founders of Hector Beverages in the summer of
2012, when one of them, James Nuttall, was trying to find the traditional Indian drink aam
panna (made from raw mangos) for his parents, who were visiting him in India. Not satisfied
with the selection (and hygiene) of what was being offered by the traditional street vendors
found throughout India, the founders of Hector Beverages ‘realized that traditional Indian drinks
could have a great market if produced and packaged hygienically. We didn’t do any formal
market research. We just followed our instincts,’ says Mr Kakkar.
Those instincts could prove to be killer. As V.T. Bharadwaj, an early investor in Hector
Beverages, puts it, ‘India has a rich history of traditional beverages, and it’s a shame that no
one has tried to present them in an attractive and aspirational manner.’ Ethnic beverages havepage 754
the ‘potential to transform the beverages landscape in India. It is a category that is waiting to
explode and has the potential to break the back of the cola market.’
Starting in 2013 with just two flavours, Paper Boat now offers consumers several distinct, and
uniquely Indian, flavours in convenient 250 ml Doy Pak packs (sealed plastic bags, originally
designed to be used by astronauts in space), with selected products also offered in 500 ml
Tetra Pak containers. In keeping with Indian tradition, Paper Boat uses no preservatives,
carbonation or colour additives. It reportedly takes 18 months for the company to go from an
idea to actually having a product on the shelf, and Paper Boat always tries to have several new
flavours in the development pipeline. Mr Kakkar says that the secret to Paper Boat’s success is
simple: ‘We are extremely strong in product development. Whether it is identifying the right
vendors, sourcing at the right time or establishing the right processing standards, we have
developed a very strong knowledge base.’
Paper Boat’s Strategy: Navigating the Ethnic
Drinks Market
Right from the beginning, the brand strategy for Paper Boat was to create something ‘that our
mothers and grandmothers made, [but] that we don’t have the time/recipes/ingredients to make
today, but the taste of which have left a “limbic print” on our minds’. The marketing challenge for
Hector Beverages was to find the balance of bringing back fond childhood memories while at
the same time not being seen as old-fashioned. The company addressed this concern by way
of the fun, bright, modern design of its packaging, which offers convenience as well as
adequate shelf life – something that is important in the hot tropical zones of India. What
differentiates Paper Boat from competing western firms is the ‘emotional benefit’ the company
has, due to the fact that many Indians have pleasant memories of drinking ethnic beverages
during the hot months of summer as children. Oddly, the name Paper Boat was chosen
specifically because it has nothing to do with beverages. It was believed this would entice
consumers by making them curious.
Hector Beverages definitely attracts kudos from marketing experts. As one consultant says,
‘The company has been innovative in terms of product, packaging and marketing to create the
consumer wow factor. It can certainly take credit for that.’ At first, Paper Boat had difficulty
finding space on retailers’ shelves due to the fact it was perceived as being not
upscale enough. But, after a series of advertisements on the front pages of some
of the country’s top-selling newspapers, Paper Boat was able to make its way into stores.
Hector Beverages always had an active presence in online media, but has only recently turned
to mainstream media as a way of regularly reaching customers. A positive element that is
helping the company is the trend in India of going from an unbranded to a branded goods
market. A key component of Paper Boat’s brand, according to Mr Kakkar, is showing
consumers that its products are ‘authentic’ and ‘alive’. To achieve this, Paper Boat focuses its
marketing campaigns around such simple childhood memories as walking home from school
and playing with paper boats and kites, as well as using well-known Indian melodies. Paper
Boat also uses ‘stories’, which it promotes on various digital platforms. According to a marketing
executive at the company, ‘There are stories that we put up on Facebook, Instagram and
Twitter every day, and we keep doing films that are hosted on YouTube. A lot of it is done in￾house with some exclusive partners who help us create those ideas.’ One idea came about in
August 2019, thanks to a collaboration with Tetra Pak, in which innovative holographic
packaging was used for two of its products: Alphonso Aamras and pomegranate juice.Paper Boat’s Potential to Spring a Leak?
Hector Beverages says it travels all over India to find the right recipes for Paper Boat. By
interacting with people in small towns and villages, the company can get a feel for what flavours
are popular in a particular region. For Hector Beverages, no part of the country is too remote to
find a great idea for a new recipe – but therein lies a major criticism of the company.
The recipes that Hector Beverages uses to make Paper Boat have been taken from vendors
located in such places as railway stations, as well as from temples and people’s homes. They
are not owned by Hector Beverages. This means the company has almost no intellectual
property (IP) to speak of (as opposed to Coca-Cola’s world-famous secret formula). Executives
at Hector Beverages disagree, however: ‘Our IP is our brand and all the qualities associated
with the product. Our IP is the processes we follow which make our drinks very different in their
unique way. For example, all our mangoes are naturally processed. No other company is doing
it,’ says the company.
Paper Boat can mostly be found in large cities, with its ideal target consumer being someone
between 25 and 40 years old. However, because Paper Boat is actually a niche market player,
proper distribution is a never-ending concern. You can therefore also buy its products online (a
link on Paper Boat’s website sends you to Amazon.com). In an effort to leverage its
understanding of the Indian market to gain a competitive advantage, Paper Boat decided to
cater to an even more niche market by offering seasonal drinks such as thandai, serbet-e￾khaas, rose tamarind and panakam. The company says it is also targeting Indians who live in
other countries. However, the immediate challenge, as Mr Kakkar sees it, is to penetrate the
largely untouched rural Indian market, something that Hector Beverages seems well placed to
do. Indian consumers, though, are very demanding, expecting value for their money, resulting
in squeezed profit margins.
For his part, Mr Kakkar doesn’t seem to be too worried about competing with one of the largest
soft drinks companies in the world. When speaking of his former employer, he has only nice
things to say about upper management at Coca-Cola: ‘They have got in some of the best
performers from Coca-Cola worldwide. This will result in faster decision-making.’ For Paper
Boat’s sake, let’s hope that faster doesn’t necessarily mean better.
Coca-Cola Fires Shots Over the Bow of Paper
Boat
But Coca-Cola hasn’t remained in business for more than 130 years by taking things lying
down. Managers at the company realized they had made a strategic blunder by not having the
‘right product at the right price point’ in India. Between 2017 and 2018, Coca-Cola went on the
counter-attack, hoping to show Hector Beverages it could beat the company at its own game, or
at least show it is willing to die trying. The company decided it would go ‘hyper local’,
introducing such flavours as orange, pomegranate, guava, litchi and a special variety of mango
only grown in West Bengal – all of this in an effort to cater to the highly selective taste buds of
the average Indian consumer.
This reinvigorated strategy for the juice sector builds on what were already seen previously as
favourable results. Between 2012 and 2017, according to research firm Euromonitor, Coca￾Cola’s share of the fruit juice market went from about 28.5 per cent to a little over 31 per cent.
Not spectacular, but positive nonetheless.page 755
These tepid results, however, were to be quickly undone by the Covid-19 pandemic. Demand
for its popular carbonated brands, such as Thums Up, Sprite and the eponymous Coca-Cola,
was drastically reduced due to lockdowns. In September 2020, the company saw a 10 per cent
drop in its bottling business in India.
Post-Covid, Coke’s performance in India has been impressive. In 2021, it saw unit case volume
grow by an impressive 8 per cent. This was better than its pre-Covid sales for 2019. Overall,
the company reported sales growth for the December 2021 quarter to be nearly 30 per cent.
While still in an advantageous position in terms of brand image and financial resources, Coca￾Cola is not prepared to sit idly by and see its market threatened. In a bold move, the company
has gone ‘blue ocean’ in its strategy, trying to create a whole new market by mixing fruit juice
with some of its carbonated drinks. The advantage here, in addition to quite possibly creating a
new market segment, is that these drinks are taxed at a lower rate by the Indian government. In
a bid to expand its product selection even further, the company has announced a new line of
frozen desserts, again using local fruits.
Coca-Cola: As Indian as Cricket and Kaju ki Barfi
(Traditional Indian Dessert)?
In an effort to underline the seriousness of its commitment to India, Coca-Cola has announced
plans to spend almost US$2 billion building its own agricultural ecosystem in the country over
the next several years. This will, in effect, create a supply chain that will provide Coca-Cola with
all the ingredients and infrastructure it needs to go from ‘grove to glass’, while at the same time
supporting the local Indian economy. By being more local, Coca-Cola should also be able to
adapt itself better to changing market conditions. In 2017 alone, the company launched 17 new
products, the majority of them local, with many more reportedly in development as well. As one
Coca-Cola executive says, ‘The India strategy replicates the global strategy of providing choice.
In India, we will localize these choices.’
Previously, Coca-Cola had focused on big cities and the urban (and wealthy) market. However,
analysts believe if the company really wants to grow it needs to reach the almost 650,000
villages in India. That is where the real growth will come from (currently, rural sales make up 38
per cent of Coca-Cola India’s overall business). This is not necessarily an impossible task.
According to consultant Jagdeep Kapoor, thanks to mass media and advertising, there is a
ready, and thirsty, market waiting for Coca-Cola products. The trouble, however, is that in the
countryside, consumers prefer fresh juices not bottled ones.
The president of Coca-Cola India, Mr Sanket Ray, is extremely confident about the growth
potential for the Indian market. ‘We are highly optimistic on the growth numbers for both short￾term and medium-term,’ says Mr Ray. He insists that innovation will be the ‘key growth engine’
for improved performance, adding, ‘we are looking at 15–20 per cent of our growth coming from
innovations’. The company plans on expanding its business through increased efforts in
product offerings, marketing and distribution. Coke will focus on increasing sales in urban areas
through additional premium products, and in rural areas through improving its network and
offering low-cost options.page 756
In terms of new products, the company says ‘the right categories will be introduced at the right
time’. For starters, in December 2021 a ‘Zero Sugar’ version of Coca-Cola was introduced. But
Mr Ray promises that ‘local brands, with regional flavours’ will also be available. For example,
there are plans to offer the company’s sparkling zeera (cumin) flavoured drink, RimZim,
nationwide through a major marketing and distribution drive. Coca-Cola also has designs on
launching its own aam panna flavour drink under its mango-based brand Maaza. Ever the
visionary, Mr Ray states confidently, ‘We are also looking to launch in the sports segment and
something in the mass-energy area as well.’ In an effort to get even more revenue from existing
brands, the company announced plans to roll out an apple sparkling drink under its Fanta label
in 2022.
Leaving no stone unturned, Coke India will also expand its coffee business. In 2018, it acquired
Costa Coffee, a coffee chain brand. Mr Ray says it is a relatively small business when
compared with global rival Starbucks, but expansion plans are ambitious. ‘We are small and
present in a very small number of cities’, he explains. However, he continues, ‘Our goal is to
expand the chain and be a pan-India player in the next three years.’ Coca-Cola is expected to
have a coffee outlet in the top 10 to 20 cities in India.
In terms of marketing, the company strives to be seen as understanding and relating to Indian
culture. In early 2022, it announced its ‘Coke Tables’ campaign. The intended goal of this is to
‘bring people together to share their meals with a Coca-Cola to create magical moments of
togetherness’, the company helpfully explains. The new campaign was introduced in Punjab,
with plans to expand it to other Indian states by the end of that year. The ‘Coke Tables’
promotion basically proposes that when someone puts food next to a Coke, it immediately turns
into a ‘table’, whether it be a normal dining table, the hood of one’s car or even a staircase. As
the company puts it, ‘A “Coke x Meals” table is the place where we get together and savor both
the food and each other – it is where all conversations happen, and all moments are shared.’ To
emphasize the importance of the campaign, Coke signed up one of India’s best-known pop
stars, Diljit Dosanjh, to promote the initiative in Punjab.
In an effort to be seen as a responsible and respected corporate citizen in India, Coke has
announced several ambitious corporate social responsibility initiatives. One is to make 100 per
cent of its packaging recyclable by 2025, as well as to use at least 50 per cent recycled material
in its packaging by 2030. Presently, the company offers many of its beverages in returnable
glass bottles that are 100 per cent recyclable.
Coca-Cola is also dedicated to being a responsible steward of water in India. Through
committed conservation efforts, the company was able to reduce the amount of water used to
make its drinks – commonly referred to as its water use ratio (WUR). In 2010, Coke used 2.56
litres of water to make a single litre of beverage; by 2020 this was reduced to an impressive
1.73 litres. Furthermore, through additional initiatives taken in conjunction with the Coca-Cola
India Foundation (known as Anandana), a combined water replenishment potential of 26 billion
litres was established.
But is all of this enough?
As one astute beverage executive puts it, ‘For Coca-Cola to boost its growth it needs to recruit
more consumers at the front-end and at a much faster pace than it is doing at present. It needs
to bring them into the fold of packaged beverages and then work at moving them up the value
chain. One answer to this is product innovation. You have to create new and exciting productswhich offer high value for money.’ The executive who said this? None other than Mr Kakkar,
head of Hector Beverages.
But Mr Kakkar should be wary. When you play with giants, there is always the danger you might
get crushed. As Saurabh Uboweja, head of the consultancy Brands of Desire, puts it, the
solution is quite simple. He believes that, ‘for Coke … Paper Boat would be a logical target
brand to buy out at some stage, to strengthen its increasingly diversified product portfolio’.
For Coca-Cola, it looks like it just might be a case of ‘if you can’t beat them, buy them’.
Questions
1. What are the main characteristics of Coca-Cola’s brand-building strategy in India since it re￾entered the Indian market in 1993?
2. What are the main features of Coke’s strategy in response to Paper Boat’s position in the
Indian market?
3. How can Coca-Cola counter Paper Boat’s aggressive competitive marketing strategy?

HIDDEN GEM 19.1
Marvel Comics: From Bankruptcy to Superbrand
Marvel Comics is at the centre of a universe, and has become one of the most profitable
entertainment brands of all time through extending and reformulating its core products.
Originally created in 1939 by Martin Goodman as Timely Comics, Marvel Comics really got
going in 1961 with introduction of the Fantastic Four, a team of superheroes created by
Stan Lee and colleagues. New products – comics based on new superhero characters –
developed rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s, with individual heroes Captain Marvel, The
Hulk, Spider-Man and Wolverine, superhero teams the X-Men, Guardians of the Galaxy and
Avengers, and villains like Dr Doom, Magneto, Ultron and Green Goblin, becoming some of
the most famous.
Source: durantelallera/Shutterstock
By 1968, Marvel was selling 50 million comic books per year to a more adult reader. Stan
Lee had changed the direction for this type of product, moving away from young children
(the typical comic readers of the time). So significant was this refocus that this period
became known as the ‘Marvel Age of Comics’. The Marvel brand continued to evolve, and
Spider-Man, Howard the Duck and Conan the Barbarian began to appear regularly in comic
strips in newspapers.page 761
In the 1980s and 1990s, there were many changes, in ownership of the brand and
publishing deals, seeking to keep the brand moving forwards. Marvel expanded globally,
developing new types of products (e.g. trading cards, colouring books, video games).
Marvel also extended its storytelling through animated cartoons and live-action TV series
featuring The Hulk, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter and many others.
But all this success was about to end as Marvel Entertainment Group (as it had become
known) was on the verge of bankruptcy.
In 1997, Marvel was rescued from the jaws of collapse by a US toy company, Toy Biz, which
renamed the firm Marvel Entertainment, and with publishers and editors focused on getting
the core products right: the comics were improved by improving production quality. The
company then began to diversify and expand income streams through selling the brand’s
intellectual property. For example:
licensing characters to different types of media (e.g. TV and film), which also helped to
expand international exposure
partnering with film production studios to turn comic-book superheroes into movie stars,
such as X-Men (20th Century Fox), Spider-Man (Columbia Pictures) and Iron Man
(Paramount Pictures).
In 2009, The Walt Disney Company announced it was buying Marvel Comics for $4 billion –
a deal that gave the entertainment giant access to decades of the comic brand’s assets and
heritage. Marvel Comics had just celebrated its 70th birthday, having created more than
5,000 characters, and had developed valuable feature film franchises alongside its
storytelling dynasty, which aligned with Disney’s corporate vision and mission of providing
entertainment to inform and inspire through storytelling. Marvel has been redefined as a
super (hero) brand, with 22 movie franchises and earnings of $17 billion – more than any
other movie franchise.
Marvel keeps its audiences coming back by finding the right balance between creativity and
innovation, while retaining the essence of its storytelling to resonate with its core customers.
Its superheroes have been re-energized, but the brand still ensures films are clearly from
the Marvel stable of characters. In 2021, Spider-Man became Marvel’s first official digital
non-fungible token (NFT), another new product launched by the brand which means fans
can buy and own digital collectible memorabilia. Reaching back into its history, the first
Marvel comics from 1939 are also part of its NFT digital collectables.
Marvel, with its legion of characters, has survived a roller-coaster history extending over
more than 80 years. Creative development of its products and management over time have
enabled the firm to stand out as an iconic brand. And its storytelling, excitement and fantasy
of its heroes and villains keeps devoted fans coming back time and time again for more, to
find out the latest fate of their favourite superheroes.

Management
Product lifecycle management occurs over time, and the marketing
environment impacts on the viability of the life of a product. In the
marketplace, consumer tastes change, perceptions of value evolve and the
competition develops new and innovative products to grow market share. This
means marketers need to consider the life of a product, which is something we
will also do in the next section, which looks at the product lifecycle model.
Before that, though, we need to consider the changing trends and challenges in
the marketing environment that have an impact on products and create new
market expectations.
Broadly speaking, the focus on mass production has shifted towards
satisfying the needs of niche markets. Consumption has changed as firms look
for emerging market opportunities to increase product variety to meet the
demands of diversified customer segments. Co-creation of value is bringing
production, supply and distribution closer together, into coordinated
production ecosystems (Mourtiz 2016), and all of this is happening in the
context of the marketing environment where forces have an impact on product
development and management.
Figure 19.1 shows the forces and areas of influence that affect product
lifecycle management: globalization, technology, the environment and the
circular economy.
FIGURE 19.1
Macroenvironmental challenges for product lifecycle managementpage 762
Globalization
Globalization affects all stages of product manufacture. Supply chains are
bringing together many firms, technologies and resources, which means
product manufacturers must improve their processes and operations to
compete globally.
Technology
New technologies influence product design, and often a product’s functions, by
improving and upgrading existing designs and adding new features. However,
this means rendering existing models obsolete, and obsolescence can impact
the environment. Often new versions of a product can be priced the same as or
at a lower price than the original, encouraging consumers to switch.Smart connected products are opening opportunities, creating new markets
and redefining business models. For example, agricultural equipment
manufacturer John Deere uses smart technology to add information services to
its equipment, providing weather data and a range of farming information
through its Go Operations Center app. Adopting the app is enabling customers
to save time, be more informed, improve decision-making and deliver
performance improvements (Porter and Heppelmann 2014; John Deere 2022).
New business models are emerging: new modes of payment, such as pay￾per-usage of equipment and pay-for-results. New technology is enabling the
development of connected products capable of self-configuring, which can
help to achieve both business and sustainability objectives (Spring and Araujo
2017). For example, L’Oréal has launched an intelligent beauty range, Perso,
which uses AI and ModiFace technology to produce personalized beauty
products on demand, such as foundation that is adapted to air quality and skin
type, and lipstick that can be matched to the clothes someone is wearing
(L’Oréal 2022) (see Exhibit 19.1).

Environment
Climate change, CO2
 emissions, global warming and water supply are just a
few of the issues having an impact on product innovation and manufacturing.
Cosmetic products have been found to act as pollutants, and plastic
microbeads in products such as face scrubs are contaminating the oceans and
marine environments. This means there is pressure on the beauty industry to
find more sustainable methods of production and for brands to reconsider their
marketing practices, which encourage particular beauty routines.
Water is central to sustainability plans and some large firms have made
commitments to change. For example, according to Aguiar et al. (2022), water
is a major component of most cosmetic products, labelled ‘aqua’ in mostpage 763
ingredient lists, and is used as a product filler to increase volume and profits.
But as water becomes more expensive, brands need to revise their production
methods and product formulations. L’Oréal is aiming to reduce water
consumption in its production by 60 per cent, and to help consumers use less
water when using its products (L’Oréal 2020). P&G has also reduced the use of
water in its manufacturing process (Procter & Gamble 2020).
Focus on the environment is not only changing product design and
production methods, it is also creating new categories of products. For
example, L’Oréal has a range of vegan haircare products; Aveda’s vegetarian
ranges of beauty products use naturally sourced ingredients and The Body
Shop packages its hair shampoos, conditioners and other products in
recyclable packaging made from recycled plastic collected in India.
The natural resource-based view (Hart 1995) stresses the importance of
gaining competitive advantage through improved environmental performance.
Product manufacturers need to implement sustainable development, product
stewardship and pollution prevention if they are to be sustainable businesses
(Zhang and Wei 2021).
Circular economy
The circular economy (CE) is a concept that encourages firms to find new
ways to use materials and products that are at end-of-life or deemed to be
waste. Restoring, preserving and renewing, and designing to reduce negative
impacts on the planet, its environments and inhabitants is central to CE
economic models. The ‘take–make–dispose’ economy approach, which relies
on using up available natural resources, is no longer a sustainable approach to
doing business. Raw materials and commodity prices are increasing, and
demand is growing, with an expected world population growth of 3 billion by
2030 (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2014). New ways must be found to
produce and manufacture products, and many firms are already doing so. For
example, French biotech firm Carbios has developed a process of enzymatic
plastic recycling, which can cut the amount of waste produced by single-use
plastics and reduce carbon emissions. Working with partner brands PepsiCo
and Nestlé, Carbios has demonstrated how discarded plastic bottles can bepage 764
processed to make new bottles, and its enzymatic process is enabling new
product development opportunities (Crownhary 2021).
Lim et al. (2022) propose the CEEP model, a three-phase method for
assessing and making strategic decisions to improve product manufacturing
(see Figure 19.2). Marketing decision-makers can apply this model to review
and improve compliance with CE principles and in doing so identify
opportunities for creating competitive advantage though improving
sustainability in product development, manufacturing and recycling. The
method involves:
Phase one – identify opportunities for making improvements: which can
include looking at environmental impacts (e.g. energy use, waste
production), exploring sustainable production methods, changing
approaches and redesigning product uses
Phase two – determining strategic directions: This is the critical phase
where firms look for different ways to solve/gain the opportunities identified
in phase one. Avoidance means looking for solutions to eliminate the
problem (e.g. can a product be manufactured without producing hazardous
waste). Substitution means can the use of renewable materials replace the
use of new materials; or can ways be found to reduce energy consumption in
manufacturing processes (e.g. using solar power, replacing light bulbs with
low-energy LEDs). Circulation means finding ways to repurpose,
reuse and recycle. Disposal occurs when there are no other
feasible options, but looking for sustainable ways to get rid of waste and
end-of-life products can still add value.
Phase three – formulate actions to improve compliance with CE principles:
Solutions will often be determined by a trade-off between economic
resources, manufacturing imperatives and customer values pertaining to CE
principles (Lim et al. 2022).

Having considered some of the potential impacts of marketing environment
forces we now explore managing products over time.
Managing Product Lines and Brands
Over Time: The Product Lifecycle
No matter how wide the product mix, both product lines and individual brands
need to be managed over time. A useful starting point for conceptualizing the
changes that occur during the lifetime of a product is the product lifecycle
(PLC). The PLC is a flexible model that can be applied to both brands and
product lines (Polli and Cook 1969). For simplicity, in the rest of this chapter,
brands and product lines will be referred to as products. We will now look at
the product lifecycle before going on to discussing its uses and limitations.
The classic product lifecycle has four stages (see Figure 19.3):
introduction, growth, maturity and decline.
FIGURE 19.3
The product lifecycle (PLC)Source: Margarita Ksenokratova/Shutterstock
Introduction
When first introduced to the market, a product’s sales growth is typically low,
and financial losses are incurred because of heavy development and
promotional costs. Firms should monitor the speed of product adoption and, if
this is disappointing, consider terminating the product at this stage.
Leading brands such as Samsung, IBM, Mercedes, Unilever, VW, Toyota
and Apple invest heavily in new product development to create products that
confer new features and benefits for customers. Because of this heavy
investment, high promotional expenditures and low sales, losses are often
suffered during product introduction. Finland’s Nokian Tyres made a long-term
investment in product research and innovation, which improved the firm’s
knowledge and capabilities. Its expertise in heavy-tyre manufacturing has
enabled it to become a world-leading specialist manufacturer. Nokian Tyres
invests in communicating the benefits of its products in business-to-business
markets to ensure continued growth (Nokian 2022). Coca-Cola constantly
invests in launching new products, for example Coca-Cola with coffee mocha,
and new packaging for Coca-Cola flavours, enabling the brand to diversify
(into coffee substitutes) and build market share (soft drinks) (Coca-Cola
Company 2022) (see Exhibit 19.2).

Growth
This stage is characterized by a period of faster sales and profit growth. Sales
growth is fuelled by rapid market acceptance and, for many products, repeat
purchasing. Profits may begin to ebb towards the latter stages of the growth
cycle as new rivals enter the market, attracted by fast sales growth and high
profit potential. The tablet computer market is an example of this. Apple
introduced the iPad in 2010 and the rapid sales growth was mirrored
by an increase in competing products, for example the Samsung
Galaxy Tab and Hewlett-Packard TouchPad. The smartphone market
developed as technology innovation enabled mobile computing to be
integrated into modern handsets; smartphones began to take market share from
some brands of tablets. During the growth stage, many rival technology
companies entered the market with operating systems for the new types of
phones, including Apple iOS, Google Android and Microsoft Windows. The
end of the growth period is often associated with competitive shakeout, when
weaker suppliers cease production. Technology markets are particularlysusceptible to rapidly escalating periods of growth followed by dramatic
market collapse.
Maturity
Eventually (in the classic model) sales peak and flatten as saturation occurs,
hastening competitive shakeout. The survivors battle for market share by
employing product improvements, advertising and sales promotional offers,
dealer discounts and price cutting; the result is a strain on profit margins,
particularly for follower brands. The need for effective brand building is
acutely recognized during maturity, as brand leaders are in the strongest
position to resist the pressure on profit margins (Doyle 1989). Not all products
follow the classic model. Heinz has been advertising its brand of baked beans
for over 50 years and the brand continues to retain its market share. In the
early days, the manufacturer differentiated the brand using the slogan ‘Beanz
Meanz Heinz’. Investment in this iconic advertising campaign enabled Heinz
to fend off competitors and continue to stimulate sales in a mature market.
Exhibit 19.3 shows how Heinz celebrated the 50th anniversary of its baked
beans with iconic product packaging.

Decline and product line extension
Sales and profits fall during the decline stage as new technology or changes in
customer tastes work to reduce demand for the product, for example mobile
phone handset and mobile network generations. With 2G networks (launched
in 1991) and mobile phones, we could make and accept calls and send text
messages from almost anywhere. Nokia sold more than 160 million of its 3210
model. Then the launch of 3G networks (in 2001) expanded wireless data
sharing and boosted network speeds, creating the opportunity to redesign the
functionality of the mobile phone. BlackBerry launched its 5810 in 2002, with
a keyboard and advanced security features. Nokia’s 3210 eventually went into
decline and the BlackBerry dominated the smartphone market until 2007 when
Apple launched its first iPhone, which eventually wiped out BlackBerry. When
4G networks were introduced (in 2009), this made data transfer and
connections more reliable and faster, and created sufficient capacity for
streaming video in real time, which in turn created opportunities for further
upgrades of popular handset models. The then new Samsung Galaxy S4 (80
million units sold) and iPhone 6 (22 million units sold) added new features and
functions to entice customers to adopt 4G enhanced models. Since then, there
have been product upgrades to both brands’ handsets (e.g. better cameras,
more storage capacity, cloud storage) with each set of improvements pushing
previous models further into decline. 5G networks (launched in 2019) bring
even faster data transfer speeds, more reliability and higher-resolution video
calls (Galazzo 2022). The Samsung Galaxy 10 was 5G-enabled but has been
superseded by the S20, which has enhanced features. At every stage of mobile
network advances, models of Samsung and Apple phones fall into decline as
they are superseded by product line extensions that take place simultaneously
to enable the brands to retain and grow market share (see Exhibit 19.4).
Mobile phone manufacturers constantly redesign their handsets as network
technology improves.

When faced with declining sales, firms may also revise promotional and
product development budgets by reducing spending, and marginal distributors
are dropped as suppliers seek to maintain (or increase) profit margins.
Alternatively, advertising may be used to defend against rivals and prevent the
sales of a brand from falling into decline, and to promote product extensions.
Uses of the Product Lifecycle
The product lifecycle (PLC) concept is useful for product management in
several ways.
Product termination
First, the PLC emphasizes the fact that nothing lasts for ever. There is a danger
that management may fall in love with certain products. Maybe a firm was
founded on the success of a product; perhaps the product champion of a past
success is now the chief executive. Under such circumstances there can be
emotional ties with the product that can transcend normal commercial
considerations. The PLC highlights the fact that products need to be terminated
and new products developed to replace them. Without this sequence, a firm
may find itself with a group of products all in the decline stage of their PLC.
Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder, pioneered the market for selling computers
into schools and educational markets in the US, but the latest iPad produced bypage 767
the global brand’s executives appears to be out of touch with the needs of
educational markets. The Amazon Fire, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Huawei
MediaPad touchscreen alternatives are popular in schools, as is Google’s
Chromebook; they are cheaper and better suited to the needs of schoolchildren
(Turner 2022).
Growth projections
The second use of the PLC concept is to warn against the dangers of assuming
that growth will continue. Swept along by growing order books, management
can fall into the trap of believing that the heady days of rising sales and profits
will continue for ever. The PLC reminds managers that growth will
end and suggests a need for caution when planning investment in
new production facilities.
Marketing objectives and the PLC
The PLC emphasizes the need to review marketing objectives and strategies as
products pass through the various stages. Changes in market and competitive
conditions between the PLC stages suggest marketing strategies should be
adapted to meet them. Table 19.1 shows a set of stylized marketing responses
to each stage. Note these are broad generalizations and serve to emphasize the
need to review marketing objectives and strategies in the light of
environmental change.
TABLE 19.1 Marketing objectives and strategies over the product lifecycleThe strategic marketing objective is to build sales by expanding the market
for the product. The brand objective will be to create product (as well as
brand) awareness so that customers will become familiar with generic product
benefits.
The generic product is likely to be basic, with an emphasis on reliability
and functionality rather than special features to appeal to different customer
groups. Once, desktop computers were the de facto machines for all our
computing needs; then the laptop arrived which was a mobile equivalent.
Generally, these were expensive, heavy and suffered from poor battery life;
there was therefore a gap in the market to meet the needs of target audiences
who wanted lighter machines to last longer while on the move. The netbook
was able to fill this gap. Fairly basic models were offered, providing mobile
computing and internet access at affordable prices (e.g. Asus, Acer, Samsung).
The functionality was basic, and the processor speed and memory were fairly
limited compared with their desktop and laptop counterparts. This lack of
benefits eventually enabled other faster devices with a greater range of benefits
to supersede the netbook, for example tablet computers such as the iPad and
Microsoft Surface Pro, and smartphones such as Apple’s iPhone and the
Samsung Galaxy.
Introduction
Promotion will support the brand objectives by gaining awareness for the
brand and product type, and by stimulating trial. Typically, price will be high
because of the heavy development costs and the low level of competition.
Distribution will be patchy, as some dealers are wary of stocking the new
product until it has proved to be successful in the marketplace.
Growth
The strategic marketing objective during the growth phase is to build sales and
market share. The strategic focus will be to penetrate the market by building
brand preference. To accomplish this task, the product will be redesigned to
create differentiation, and promotion will stress the functional and/or
psychological benefits that accrue from the differentiation. Awareness and trial
to acquire new customers are still important, but promotion will begin to focus
on repeat purchases. As development costs are defrayed and competitionpage 768
increases, prices will fall. Rising consumer demand and increased sales force
effort will widen distribution.
Maturity
As sales peak and stabilize, the strategic marketing objective will be to hold on
to profits and sales by protecting market share rather than embark on costly
competitive challenges. Since sales gains can be made only at the expense of
competition, strong challenges are likely to be resisted, which will lead to
costly promotional or price wars. Brand objectives now focus on maintaining
brand loyalty and customer retention, and promotion will defend the brand,
stimulating repeat purchase by maintaining brand awareness and values. For
all but the brand leader, competition may erode prices and profit margins,
while distribution will peak in line with sales.
A key focus will be innovation to extend the maturity stage or, preferably,
inject growth. This may take the form of innovative promotional campaigns,
product improvements and extensions, and technological innovation. Unilever,
the Anglo-Dutch manufacturer of consumer goods, introduced Persil
Powergems to its laundry products (‘a completely new format with triple
power to clean’), a product more concentrated and more effective than
previous iterations. It also redesigned the bottle as a way of communicating the
product’s revolutionary development (Unilever plc 2017).
Decline
The conventional advice to firms managing products in the decline stage of the
PLC is to harvest or divest. A harvest strategy would result in the raising of
prices while slashing marketing expenditures to boost profit margins. The
strategic focus, therefore, is to improve marketing productivity rather than hold
or build sales. The brand loyalty that has been built up over the years is, in
effect, being exploited to create profits that can be used elsewhere in the firm
(e.g. new products). Product development will cease, the product line will be
cut to the bare minimum of brands and promotional expenditure will be cut,
possibly to zero. Distribution costs will be analysed with a view to selecting
only the most profitable outlets. The internet will be examined to explore its
potential as a low-cost promotional and distribution vehicle.Divestment may take the form of selling products to other companies or, if
there are no willing buyers, product elimination. The strategy is to extract any
residual value in the products, where possible, and to free up managerial time
and resources to be redirected at more attractive products and opportunities.
For example, Unilever sold its brands of margarine (Flora, Stork, Blue Band)
due to falling consumer demand (Ruddick and Kollewe 2017).
Two other strategies that can be applied at the decline stage are industry
revitalization and pursuit of a profitable survivor strategy.
Industry revitalization Some products go into decline not because they
are inherently unpopular but due to lack of investment. For example, years of
underinvestment in cinemas meant that the facilities were often dilapidated and
the programming offered a limited choice of films. One firm, however, saw
this scenario as a marketing opportunity. Showcase Cinemas was launched,
offering a choice of around 12 films in each venue, in modern purpose-built
premises near large conurbations. This completely changed the experience of
going to the cinema, resulting in the revitalization of the industry, and growth
in cinema attendance and profits. However, the Covid-19 pandemic had an
impact on entertainment venues, and cinemas once again experienced a decline
in attendance, with the production of blockbuster films – which act as a draw –
also declining during this period. Showcase Cinemas is surviving, but it is
constantly looking at how to ensure its future. Quirky, guerrilla-style
promotions (e.g. ‘redheads go free’), launched as Europe endured its hottest￾ever heatwave and giving some people access to its cinemas’ state-of-the-art
air conditioning, is just one example of how it is seeking to drive footfall
(Smith 2022). Thus the classic PLC prescription of harvesting in the decline
stage was rejected by a firm that was willing to invest to reposition cinemas as
an attractive means of offering evening entertainment.
Profitable survivor strategy This is another alternative to harvesting or
divestment (Aaker 2022). It involves deciding to become the sole survivor in a
declining market. This may involve being willing to incur losses while
competitors drop out, or – if it is thought this process is likely to be lengthy
and slow – to accelerate it by:
further reducing the attractiveness of the market by such actions as price
cuts or increases in promotional expenditure
buying competitors (which may be offered at a low price due to the
unattractive markets they operate in) or their product lines that compete inpage 769
the same market
agreeing to take over competitors’ contracts (e.g. supplying spare parts or
service contracts) in exchange for their agreement to drop out of the market.
Once in the position of sole supplier, the survivor can reap the rewards of a
monopoly by raising prices and resuming profitable operations.
Limitations of the Product Lifecycle
The product lifecycle is an aid to thinking about marketing decisions, but it
needs to be handled with care. Management needs to be aware of the
limitations of the PLC so that it is not misled by its prescriptions.
From fads to mainstream
Not all products follow the classic curve of the product lifecycle (Figure 19.1).
The sales of some products ‘rise like a rocket then fall like a stick’. This is
normal for fad products such as hula hoops (popularized in the 1950s), ‘pet
rocks’ (1970s), Rubik’s cube (1980s), Pokémon cards (1990s), digital cameras
(2000s), fidget spinners (2010s) and NFTs (2020s) (see Exhibit 19.5).
EXHIBIT 19.5

Some fads can enter the mainstream. For example, veganism has its origins
in early Greek history, but the vegan diet became mainstream only in the 2010s
when vegan foods became popular, seeing leading ice cream brands Ben &
Jerry’s, Häagen-Dazs and Halo Top release vegan varieties. Even vegan
butchers selling plant-based ‘meat products’ appeared (see Marketing in Action
19.1).
MARKETING IN ACTION 19.1
Jaap Korteweg: The Vegetarian Butcher
Jaap Korteweg grew up on a farm, with the breeding of cows going back nine generations in
his family. But Korteweg experienced the results of swine fever and bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (mad cow disease) on the family’s estate in the Netherlands. In 1998, at
the height of the outbreak of the disease, he started thinking very seriously about how many
animals were being killed to enable him to eat meat three times a day, and also, more
philosophically, about the fact that the reason for animals to exist is the product(s) they
produce after they are killed.
Source: Friends Stock/Shutterstock
It was several years before Korteweg became a full-time vegetarian. At first, he began by
eating organic meat and even tried keeping his own animals for five years to give them a life
before killing them. But this became like killing a family pet. So Korteweg gave up meat, but
when his hankering to eat sausages and chicken wings didn’t abate he took the radical step
of creating vegetarian ‘meat’ products. It took him 10 years to find and develop a suitably
tasty meat substitute with the right texture and bite. Korteweg worked with leading chefs to
produce a range of meat-free products that would have wide market appeal. His aim is topage 770
become the world’s biggest ‘butcher’ with his sausages, meatballs and nuggets. He’s made
a strong start, as leading supermarkets in Europe are selling his products, and his
restaurant in The Hague is growing in popularity.
The brand proved so successful it was acquired by Unilever, enabling the large FMCG
manufacturer to buy its way into the growing vegetarian and vegan market. The Vegetarian
Butcher’s products are sold in 30 countries from 20,000 retail outlets.
Based on: Sandu (2018); Vegetarian Butcher (2018); Unilever plc (2020)
Other products (and brands) appear to defy entering the decline stage. For
example, classic confectionery products and brands such as Mars bars,
Cadbury’s Milk Tray and Toblerone have survived for decades in the mature
stage of the PLC.
Nevertheless, research has shown that the classic S-shaped curve does
apply to a wide range of products, including grocery food products and
pharmaceuticals (Polli and Cook 1969).
Marketing effects
The PLC is the result of marketing activities, not the cause. One school of
thought argues the PLC is not simply a fact of life – unlike living organisms –
but is simply a pattern of sales reflecting marketing activity (Dhalia and
Yuspeh 1976). Clearly, sales of a product may flatten or fall simply because the
product has not received enough marketing attention, or has had insufficient
product redesign or promotional support. Using the PLC, argue the critics, may
lead to inappropriate action (e.g. harvesting or dropping the product), when the
correct response should be increased marketing support (e.g. product
replacement, positioning reinforcement or repositioning). Toblerone has used
creative marketing solutions to maintain sales of its classic chocolate bars
(Exhibit 19.6).
EXHIBIT 19.6

Unpredictability
The duration of the PLC stages is unpredictable. The PLC outlines the four
stages that a product passes through, without defining their duration. Clearly,
this limits its use as a forecasting tool, since it is not possible to predict when
maturity or decline will begin. The exception to this problem is when it is
possible to identify a comparator product that serves as a template for
predicting the length of each stage. Two sources of comparator products exist:
countries where the same product has already been on the market for some
time; and where similar products are in the mature or decline stages of their
lifecycle but are thought to resemble the new product in terms of consumer
acceptance. In practice, the use of comparator products is fraught with
problems. For example, the economic and social conditions of countries may
be so different that simplistic exploitation of the PLC from one country to
another may be invalid; and the use of similar products may offer inaccurate
predictions in the face of ever-shortening product lifecycles.
Misleading objective and strategy prescriptions
The stylized marketing objectives and strategy prescriptions of the PLC may
be misleading. Even if a product could accurately be classified as being in a
PLC stage and sales are not simply a result of marketing activities, critics
argue that the stylized marketing objectives and strategy prescriptions can be
misleading. For example, there can be circumstances where the appropriate
marketing objective in the growth stage is to harvest (e.g. in the face of intense
competition), in the mature stage to build (e.g. when a distinct, defensivedifferential advantage can be developed), and in the decline stage to build (e.g.
when there is an opportunity to dominate).
Value of the Product Lifecycle Concept
Like many marketing tools, the product lifecycle should not be viewed as a
panacea to marketing thinking and decision-making but as an aid to
managerial judgement. By emphasizing the changes likely to occur as a
product is marketed over time, the concept is a valuable stimulus to strategic
thinking. Yet as a prescriptive tool it is blunt. Marketing management must
monitor the real-life changes happening in the marketplace before setting
precise objectives and strategies. Mini Case 19.1 explores how technology and
the digital world are having an impact on the PLC.
MINI CASE 19.1
Disruptive Innovations
Disruptive digital technology: permanent beta and the big bang
Twenty-five years ago, few people were aware of the impact that the internet and
associated digital technologies might have on our lives, and the way we behave,
communicate and trade.
The internet has affected many aspects of marketing, and product development is no
exception. Two fundamental changes affect the PLC: ‘permanent beta’ and the big bang.
Permanent beta
Companies finding that the traditional product development lifecycle is taking too long
before a product can reach the market have now adopted the ‘permanent beta’. While some
traditional products still require a formal development process, particularly where safety,
warranty or legality is concerned (e.g. cars, aircraft, electrical goods), services and digital
products can be released ahead of their final version.
There are potential advantages of early product release. One is that it allows for errors: in a
freemium economy model (where products are provided free of charge, such as the web
browsers Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari), mistakes can be made, and customers are
far more forgiving of a service that does not work as expected if they are not paying for it.
Firms such as Dropbox do this regularly for new features in their cloud storage service, to
see how they work for a broad range of customers. Because many businesses regard their
products as constantly evolving, it makes sense for them to be described as in a state of
permanent beta. Arguably, permanent beta is work in progress, and this has implications forproduct management insofar as the whole concept of product development becomes highly
fluid and constantly evolving. For the marketing manager, this means changing planning
horizons between pre-launch activity, launch and eventual divestment.
The big bang
The first consumer e-commerce purchase took place on 11 August 1994, making it a
landmark date. The product in question was a compact disc (CD): Ten Summoner’s Tales
by UK musician Sting. From that date forward, the internet developed as a new channel to
market. Initially, CDs, books, chocolates, wine and computers were sold to those individuals
with access online. It was this demand for consumer goods and access to the internet in
consumer markets – rather than in business-to-business markets – that had a profound
influence on the growth and development of the internet as a marketing channel. Why?
First, the market potential of the virtual world offered access to new markets, both locally
and globally, and the internet enabled businesses to target new customers. This potential
played a fundamental role in driving the growth of the online economy. The internet also
offered the opportunity to trade continuously 24 hours a day and allowed innovators to
develop exciting ways to interact with the new target markets.

(cr)Dmitri Ma/Shutterstock, (br)blackliz/Shutterstock
For example, in 1995, Pierre Omidyar founded eBay, bringing online auctions and flexible
pricing to a global audience. The global success of businesses like eBay and Amazon
played a part in establishing the internet as a mainstream retail channel.
Second, the internet offered scope to satisfy customer needs. Communicating digitally,
continuously and in real-time – at first through email, then discussion boards and eventually
social media networks – opened new ways to interact with customers and find out even
more about their needs and wants. Third, the internet facilitated diffusion of digital
innovations: digital technology developed and spread rapidly. Disruptive innovations like
Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and TikTok are digital innovations with the capacity to infect the
world in days. Many new digital apps have been developed at hackathons – late-night
sessions in Silicon Valley. The outcome is that disruptive innovations enter markets as a big
bang rather than following the patterns of diffusion described by Everett Rogers (1983).page 771
page 772
The impact of the internet on marketing has been profound. Digital technology innovations
are great enablers of the principles of marketing: getting to know the customer better
through digital analytics and behavioural information; satisfying their needs better than the
competition; providing greater opportunities for tailored and personalized offers across all
aspects of product and service delivery; identifying innovative products and services, for
example smartphones and wearable technology such as Fitbits, which show us new ways
of doing things. Moreover, while digital technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace and
to have an increasing impact on the world we inhabit, marketing continues to be strongly
related to the strategic aims of organizations. But changes are emerging: market-orientated
firms that search proactively for market opportunities are discovering greater scope to
develop their market offer through analysis of digital information.
Questions:
1. What are the implications of big-bang disruption for a firm launching new technology
products?
2. Discuss the extent to which the lifecycle of physical products is influenced by the big
bang.
3. How might the digital technology landscape affect product development in the future?

Managing Brand and Product Line
Portfolios
So far, we have treated the management of products as distinct and
independent entities. However, many firms are multi-product, serving multiple
markets and segments. Some of these products will be strong, others weak.
Some will require investment to finance growth; others will generate more
cash than required. Somehow firms must decide how to distribute their limited
resources among the competing needs of products so as to achieve the best
performance for the firm as a whole. Specifically, within a product line,management needs to decide which brands to invest in or hold, and which to
withdraw support from. Similarly, within the product mix, decisions regarding
which product lines to build or hold, or to withdraw support from, need to be
taken.
Managers who focus on individual products often miss the bigger picture
that helps ensure the firm’s entire portfolio of products fits together coherently
rather than being a loose confederation of offerings that has emerged out of a
series of uncoordinated historical decisions (Shah 2002). Philips found itself in
this position, marketing a sprawling set of products, namely, semiconductors,
consumer electronics, medical equipment, lighting and small electrical
appliances (Marsh and Bickerton 2005). Recognizing a need to bring
coherence to its product lines, Philips responded by selling its semiconductor
business and rationalizing its product portfolio to focus on consumer lifestyle
(consumer electronics and domestic appliances) and healthcare. Philips’ exit
from the incandescent lighting market is a result of a big bang technology
disruption. The technology innovation was light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and
Philips’ management recognized that this technology would lead to better,
more energy-efficient and cheaper lighting technologies, which would
eventually lead to the end of the firm’s existing product ranges (Nunes and
Downes 2015) (see Exhibit 19.7).

Portfolio-planning decisions are strategic decisions, since they shape where
and with what brands/product lines a firm competes, and how its resources
should be deployed. Furthermore, these decisions are complex, because many
factors (e.g. current and future sales and profit potential, and cash flow) can
affect the outcome. The process of managing groups of brands and product
lines is called portfolio planning.
Key decisions regarding portfolio planning involve the choice of which
brands/product lines to build, hold, harvest or divest.
Two methods for managing products are widely discussed in management
literature: the Boston Consulting Group Growth–Share Matrix and the General
Electric Market Attractiveness–Competitive Position portfolio-evaluation
models. Like the PLC, these are flexible tools and can be used at both the
brand and product line levels. Indeed, corporate planners can also use them
when making resource allocation decisions at the strategic business unit level.The Boston Consulting Group Growth–Share
Matrix
A leading management consultancy, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG),
developed the well-known BCG Growth–Share Matrix (see Figure 19.4) (also
known as the ‘Boston box’). The matrix allows portfolios of products to be
depicted in a 2 × 2 box, the axes of which are based on market growth rate and
relative market share.
FIGURE 19.4
The Boston Consulting Group Growth–Share Matrix

The analysis is based upon cash flow (rather than profits), and its key
assumptions are:
market growth has an adverse effect on cash flow because of investment in
such assets as the manufacturing facilities, equipment and marketing needed
to finance growth
market share has a positive effect on cash flow, as profits are related to
market share.
The following discussion will be based on an analysis at the product line level.
Market growth is represented on the vertical axis and indicates the annual
growth rate of the market in which each product line operates. In Figure 19.4,
this is shown as 0–15 per cent, although a different range could be used,
depending on economic conditions. In this example, the dividing line betweenpage 774
high and low growth rates is 7 per cent. Market growth rate is used as a proxy
for market attractiveness.
Market share is shown on the horizontal axis and refers to the market share
of each product relative to its largest competitor. It acts as a proxy for
competitive strength. The division between high and low market share is 1.
Above this figure, a product line has a market share greater than its largest
competitor. For example, if our product had a market share of 40 per cent and
our largest competitor’s share were 30 per cent, this would be indicated as 1.33
on the horizontal axis. Below 1, we have a share less than the largest
competitor. For example, if our share were 20 per cent and the largest
competitor had a share of 40 per cent, our score would be 0.5.
The BCG argues that cash flow is dependent on the box in which a product
falls. Note that cash flow is not the same as profitability. Profits add to cash
flow, but heavy investment in such assets as manufacturing facilities,
equipment and marketing expenditure can mean that a firm can make profits
and yet have a negative cash flow.
Stars are likely to be profitable because they are market leaders, but they
require substantial investment to finance growth (e.g. new production
facilities) and to meet competitive challenges. Overall cash flow is therefore
likely to be roughly in balance. Question marks are products in high-growth
markets that cause a drain on cash flow. These are low-share products,
however, and therefore unlikely to be profitable. Overall, question marks are
big cash users. Cash cows are market leaders in mature (low-growth) markets.
High market share leads to high profitability, and low market growth means
that investment in new production facilities is minimal. This leads to a large
positive cash flow. Dogs also operate in low-growth markets but have low
market share. Except for some products near the dividing line between cash
cows and dogs (sometimes called cash dogs), most dogs produce low or
negative cash flows. Relating to their position in the product lifecycle, they are
the also-rans in mature or declining markets.
What are the strategic implications of the BCG analysis? It can be used for
setting strategic objectives and for maintaining a balanced product portfolio.
Guidelines for setting strategic objectivespage 775
Having plotted the position of each product on the matrix, a firm can begin to
think about setting the appropriate strategic objective for each line. As you
may recall from Chapter 17, there are four possible strategic objectives: build,
hold, harvest and divest. Figure 19.5 shows how each of these relates to the
star, question mark, cash cow and dog categories. However, it should be
emphasized that the BCG Matrix provides guidelines for strategic thinking and
should not be a replacement for managerial judgement.
Stars: These are the market leaders in high-growth markets. They are
already successful, and the prospects for further growth are good. As we
have seen when discussing brand building, market leaders tend to have the
highest profitability, so the appropriate strategic objective is to build sales
and/or market share. Resources should be invested to maintain/increase the
leadership position. Competitive challenges should be repelled. These are
the cash cows of the future and need to be protected.
Question marks: These can drain financial and creative resources, because
they have low profitability and need investment to keep up with market
growth. They are called question marks because management must consider
whether it is sensible to continue the required investment. The firm faces a
fundamental choice: to increase investment (build) to attempt to turn the
question mark into a star, or to withdraw support by either harvesting
(raising price while lowering marketing expenditure) or divesting (dropping
or selling it). In a few cases, a third option may be viable: to find a small
market segment (niche) where dominance can be achieved. Unilever’s latest
strategy includes making ‘planet-friendly’ food, which is healthier and more
sustainable, and this focus has led to an evolution of its product portfolio
and shakeout of some of its brands. As part of its portfolio review it has
divested its tea business, including popular brands PG Tips and Brooke
Bond. Chief executive Alan Jope said core customers were getting older and
drinking less tea, and younger consumers prefer coffee and herbal
teas. Making the future of the tea business less certain was also the
strong competition from Twinings, owned by Associated British Foods,
which had pushed PG Tips out of number-one spot (Wood 2021). Unilever
therefore realized it had to invest heavily or exit. Its decision was to sell and
focus instead on predicted future winners, such as personal care, health and
well-being.
Cash cows: The high profitability and low investment associated with high
market share in low-growth markets means that cash cows should be
defended. Consequently, the appropriate strategic objective is to hold salesand market share. The excess cash generated should be used to fund stars
and, question marks that are being built, and for research and development
for new products.
Dogs: These are weak products that compete in low-growth markets. They
are the also-rans that have failed to achieve market dominance during the
growth phase and are floundering in maturity. For those products that
achieve second or third position in the marketplace (cash dogs) a small
positive cash flow may result, and for a few others it may be possible to
reposition the product into a defendable niche. But for the bulk of dogs the
appropriate strategic objective is to harvest to generate a positive cash flow
for a time, or to divest, which allows resources and managerial time to be
focused elsewhere.
FIGURE 19.5
Strategic objectives and the ‘Boston box’
Maintaining a balanced product portfolio
Once all the firm’s products have been plotted, you can see how many stars,
question marks, cash cows and dogs are in the portfolio. Figures 19.6 and 19.7
show product portfolios that, respectively, are balanced (a good range of
products in all but the dogs quadrant) and unbalanced. The firm with the
unbalanced portfolio possesses only two stars, and the small circle indicates
that sales revenue generated will be relatively low. Similarly, there are no cashcows and four question marks. There are, then, too many question marks, no
significant stars and two dogs. This can lead to financial resources being
invested in maintaining weak products and does not leave sufficient funds to
maintain market share, leading to a vicious circle of decline.
FIGURE 19.6
A balanced portfolio
FIGURE 19.7
An unbalanced portfoliopage 776
The BCG remedy would be to conduct a detailed competitive assessment
of the four question marks and select one or two for investment. The rest
should be harvested (and the cash channelled to those that are being built) or
divested. The aim is to build the existing star (which will be the
cash cow of the future) and to build the market share of the
chosen question marks so they attain star status.
The dogs also need to be analysed. One of them (the large circle) is a large
revenue earner, which despite low profits may be making a substantial
contribution to overheads. Another product (on the left) appears to be in the
cash dog situation. But, for the other two, the most sensible strategic objective
may be to harvest or divest.
Criticisms of the BCG Growth–Share Matrix
The simplicity, ease of use and importance of the issues tackled by the BCG
Matrix have led to its widespread adoption to help firms get a handle on the
complexities of strategic resource allocation. However, the tool has alsopage 777
attracted a litany of criticism (e.g. Wensley 1981; Haspslagh 1982; Day and
Wensley 1983).
The following list draws together many of the points raised by critics of the
BCG Matrix:
The assumption that cash flow will be determined by a product’s position in
the matrix is weak. For example, some stars will show a healthy positive
cash flow, as will some dogs in markets where competitive activity is low.
The preoccupation with focusing on market share and market growth rates
distracts managerial attention from the fundamental principle in marketing:
attaining a sustainable competitive advantage.
Treating the market growth rate as a proxy for market attractiveness, and
market share as an indicator of competitive strength is over-simplistic. There
are many other factors that must be taken into account when measuring
market attractiveness (e.g. market size, the strengths and weaknesses of
competitors) and competitive strengths (e.g. exploitable marketing assets,
potential cost advantages), besides market growth rates and market share.
Since the position of a product in the matrix depends on market share, this
can lead to an unhealthy preoccupation with market share gain. In some
circumstances, this objective makes sense (e.g. brand building), but, when
competitive retaliation is likely, the costs of share building may outweigh
the gains.
The matrix ignores interdependencies between products. For example, a dog
may need to be marketed because it complements a star or a cash cow – the
dog may be a spare part for a star or a cash cow. Alternatively,
customers and distributors may value dealing with a firm that
supplies a full product line. For these reasons, dropping products because
they fall into a particular box may be naive.
The classic BCG Matrix prescription is to build stars because they will
become the cash cows of the future. However, some products have a very
short product lifecycle, in which case the appropriate strategy should be to
maximize profits and cash flow while in the star category (e.g. fashion
goods).
Marketing objectives and strategy are heavily dependent on an assessment
of what competitors are likely to do. How will they react if prices are
lowered or raised when implementing a build or harvest strategy, for
example? This is not considered in the matrix.The matrix assumes products are self-funding. For example, selected
question marks are built using cash generated by cash cows. But this ignores
capital markets, which may mean that a wider range of projects can be
undertaken as long as they have positive net present values of their future
cash flows.
The matrix is vague regarding the definition of ‘market’. Should we take the
whole market (e.g. for confectionery) or just the market segment we operate
in (e.g. expensive boxed chocolates)? The matrix is also vague when
defining the dividing line between high- and low-growth markets. A
chemical firm that tends to generate sales in lower-growth markets might
use 3 per cent, whereas a leisure goods firm whose markets on average
experience much higher rates of growth might use 10 per cent. Also, over
what period do we define market growth? These issues question the
theoretical soundness of the underlying concepts and allow managers to
manipulate the figures so their products fall into the right boxes.
The matrix was based on cash flow, but perhaps profitability (e.g. return on
investment) is a better criterion for allocating resources.
The matrix lacks precision in identifying which question marks to build,
harvest or divest.
2 × 2 matrices, in general, are limited and act more as a screening tool to
facilitate further analysis than to provide definite answers (Calandro and
Lane 2007).
General Electric Market Attractiveness–
Competitive Position Model
The BCG Matrix enjoyed tremendous success as management grappled with
the complex issue of strategic resource allocation. Stimulated by this success
and some of the weaknesses of the model (particularly the criticism of its over￾simplicity), McKinsey & Co developed the more wide-ranging Market
Attractiveness–Competitive Position (MA–CP) Model in conjunction with
General Electric (GE) in the US.
Market attractiveness criteria
Instead of market growth alone, a range of market attractiveness criteria were
used, such as:page 778
market size
market growth rate
beatable rivals
market entry barriers
social, political and legal factors.
Competitive strength criteria
Similarly, instead of using only market share as a measure of competitive
strength, a number of factors were used, such as:
market share
reputation
distribution capability
market knowledge
service quality
innovation capability
cost advantages.
Assessing market attractiveness and competitive strength
Management is allowed to decide which criteria are applicable for their
products. This gives the MA–CP Model flexibility. Having decided on the
criteria, management’s next task is to agree upon a weighting system for each
set of criteria, with those factors that are more important having a higher
weighting. Table 19.2 shows a set of weights for market
attractiveness. Management has decided that the key factors that
should be used to assess market attractiveness are market size, market growth
rate, beatable rivals and market entry barriers; 10 points are then shared
between these four factors depending on their relative importance in assessing
market attractiveness. Market size (weighting = 4.0) is considered the most
important and market entry barriers (1.5) the least important of the four
factors.
TABLE 19.2 An example of market attractiveness assessmentNext, management assesses the market for the product under examination
on each of the four factors on a scale of 1 to 10. The market is rated very
highly on size (rating = 9.0), it possesses beatable rivals (8.0), its growth rate is
also rated highly (7.0) and there are some market barriers, although they are
not particularly high (6.0). By multiplying each weighting by its corresponding
rating and then summing, a total score indicating the overall attractiveness of
the market for the product under examination is obtained. In this case, the
market attractiveness for the product achieves an overall score of 79 per cent.
Competitive strength assessment begins by selecting the strengths that are
needed to compete in the market. Table 19.3 shows that market share,
distribution capability, service quality, innovation capability and cost
advantages are the factors considered necessary for success. Management then
assigns a weight by sharing 10 points between each of these strengths
according to their relative importance in achieving success. Innovation
capability (weighting = 3.0) is regarded as the most important strength
required to compete effectively. Distribution capability (1.0) is considered the
least important of the five factors. The firm’s capabilities on each of the
required strengths are rated on a scale from 1 to 10. Firm capabilities are rated
very highly on innovation capability (rating = 9.0), market share (8.0) and cost
advantages (8.0), and highly on distribution capability (7.0), but service quality
(5.0) is mediocre. By multiplying each weighting by its corresponding rating
and then summing, a total score indicating the overall competitive strength of
the firm is obtained. In this example, the competitive strength of the firm
achieves an overall score of 76 per cent.
TABLE 19.3 An example of competitive strength assessmentpage 779
The market attractiveness and competitive strength scores for the product
under appraisal can now be plotted on the MA–CP matrix (see Figure 19.8).
The process is repeated for each product under investigation, so that the
products’ relative positions on the MA–CP matrix can be established. Each
product position is represented by a circle, the size of which is in proportion to
its sales.
FIGURE 19.8
The General Electric Market Attractiveness-Competitive Position Model
Setting strategic objectivesThe model is shown in Figure 19.8. Like the BCG Matrix, the
recommendations for setting strategic objectives are dependent on the
product’s position on the grid. Five zones are shown in Figure 19.8. The
strategic objectives associated with each zone are as follows (Hofer and
Schendel 1978):
Zone 1: build – manage for sales and market share growth, as the market is
attractive and competitive strengths are high (equivalent to star products).
Zone 2: hold – manage for profits consistent with maintaining market share,
as the market is not particularly attractive but competitive strengths are high
(equivalent to cash cows).
Zone 3: build/hold/harvest – this is the question-mark zone. Where
competitors are weak or passive, a build strategy will be used. In the face of
strong competitors, a hold strategy may be appropriate – or harvesting,
where commitment to the product/market is lower (similar to question
marks).
Zone 4: harvest – manage for cash, as both market attractiveness and
competitive strengths are fairly low.
Zone 5: divest – improve short-term cash yield by dropping or selling the
product (equivalent to dog products).
In the example shown in Figure 19.8, the circle labelled A indicates the
position of the product, which falls within Zone 1 as it operates in an attractive
market and its competitive strengths are high. This would suggest a build
strategy that probably involves investing in raising service quality levels,
which were found to be relatively weak.
Criticisms of the GE MA–CP Model
Proponents of the GE MA–CP Model of portfolio evaluation argue the analysis
is much richer than that provided by the BCG analysis – thanks to more factors
being considered – and is more flexible. These are substantial advantages and
the model is widely used, with companies such as BP, IBM, Honda, Nissan,
Philips, Centrica, Mitsubishi and GE employing it to aid their strategic
thinking. Critics argue, however, it is harder to use than the BCG Matrix, since
it requires managerial agreement on which factors to use, their weightings and
scoring. Furthermore, its flexibility provides a lot of opportunity for
managerial bias to enter the analysis, whereby product managers argue for
factors and weightings that show their products in a good light (Zone 1). This
last point suggests the analysis should be conducted at a managerial levelpage 780
higher than that being assessed. For example, decisions on which product lines
to be built, held, and so on, should be taken at the strategic business unit level,
and allocations of resources to brands should be decided at the group product
manager level.
The contribution of product portfolio planning
Despite the limitations of the BCG and the GE MA–CP portfolio-evaluation
models, both have contributed to the practice of portfolio planning. We shall
now discuss this contribution and suggest how the models can usefully be
incorporated into product strategy.
Different products and different roles
The models emphasize the important strategic point that different products
should have different roles in the product portfolio. The portfolio planning
models stress this should not necessarily be the case and may be harmful in
many situations. For example, to ask for a 20 per cent return on investment
(ROI) for a star may result in underinvestment to meet the profit requirement.
On the other hand, 20 per cent ROI for a cash cow or a harvested product may
be too low. The implication is that products should be set profitability
objectives in line with the strategic objective decisions.
Different reward systems and types of manager
By stressing the need to set different strategic objectives for different products,
the models, by implication, support the notion that different reward systems
and types of manager should be linked to them. For example, managers of
products being built should be marketing-led and rewarded for improving sales
and market share. Conversely, managers of harvested (and to some extent cash
cow) products should be more cost orientated and rewarded by profit and cash
flow achievement.
Aid to managerial judgementManagers may find it useful to plot their products on both the BCG and GE
MA–CP portfolio grids as an initial step in pulling together the complex issues
involved in product portfolio planning. This can help them to get a handle on
the situation and allows issues to be resolved. The models can then act as an
aid to managerial judgement without in any way supplanting that judgement.
Managers should feel free to bring into the discussion any other factors they
feel are not adequately covered by the models. The models can therefore be an
aid to strategic thinking in multi-product, multi-market companies.
Strategies for Growth: Product
The emphasis in product portfolio analysis is on managing an existing set of
products in such a way as to maximize their strengths, but firms also need to
look to new products and markets for future growth. Both product strategies
aim to ensure the future of a brand (Field 2018). Sir James Dyson, inventor
and entrepreneur, built the Dyson brand by taking radical steps when
developing innovations and new products. Dyson’s vacuum cleaners
(intelligent and cordless) impacted on the market for corded vacuum cleaners
in favour of cordless models, allowing Dyson to become market leader. But the
brand has also developed the Dyson HEPA purifier, which cleans the air while
cooling a room, and the Dyson Supersonic hair dryer, building a more diverse
portfolio that targets new and existing markets (Dyson 2022).
A useful way of looking at growth opportunities is the Ansoff Matrix, as
shown in Figure 19.9 (Ansoff 1957). By combining present and new products
and present and new markets into a 2 × 2 matrix, four product strategies for
growth are revealed. Although the Ansoff Matrix does not prescribe when each
strategy should be employed, it is a useful framework for thinking about the
ways in which growth can be achieved through product strategy.
FIGURE 19.9
Product growth strategies: the Ansoff MatrixFigure 19.10 shows how the Ansoff Matrix can be used to implement a
growth strategy.
FIGURE 19.10
Strategic options for growth strategiespage 781
page 782
Market penetration in existing markets with current products is achieved
by winning competitors’ customers. This may be accomplished by more
effective use of promotion or distribution, or by cutting prices. Increasing
promotional expenditure is a method of winning competitors’ customers and
market penetration.
Ultimately the aim is to increase market share for existing products and
services. Greggs is the leading ‘food on the go’ retailer in the UK and its
strategy to increase market penetration has been to invest in digital marketing.
Investment in digital technology is part of a strategic plan to provide the best
customer experience and increase customer loyalty. During the Covid
pandemic, Greggs quickly established click-and-collect and
delivery services by partnering with Just Eat. This extension of
its existing product offer has enabled greater market penetration (Greggs
2021). Market penetration can also be achieved by increasing usage rate.
Kellogg’s has also tried to increase the usage (eating) rate of its cornflakes by
promoting eating them in the evening as well as at breakfast time.
To protect the penetration already gained in a market, a business may
consider methods of discouraging competitive entry. Apple has more than 50
per cent of the smartphone market and to retain its market share releases
upgrades and enhancements to its core products. But is also pursues a
diversification strategy (see below). Barriers can be created by cost
advantages (lower labour costs, access to raw materials, economies of scale),
highly differentiated products, high switching costs (the costs of changing
from existing supplier to a new supplier, for example), high marketing
expenditures and displaying aggressive tendencies to retaliate.
A firm may attempt market expansion in a market it is already servicing
by converting non-users to users in this existing market to buy its product.
This can be an attractive option when non-users form a sizeable segment and
may be willing to try the product given suitable inducements.
Lapsed users can also be targeted. Kellogg’s has targeted breakfast cereal
users (specifically fathers) to rediscover the pleasure of eating cornflakes when
feeding their children. Birds Eye targeted lapsed customers by positioning its
frozen ready meals as a preferred choice with its ‘what’s for tea campaign (see
Marketing in Action 17.2 in Chapter 17 for a discussion on Birds Eye). Marketexpansion can also be achieved by increasing usage rate. Breakfast cereal
brands sometimes advertise in the evening to encourage more consumption.
Price wars are another way of retaining customers encouraging them to
buy more. Supermarkets vie for the shopper pound with advertising, sales
promotions and discount offers, especially when there is a seasonal event,
religious festival or an upturn in the weather suggesting it might be time for a
weekend of eating outside.
Market development entails the promotion of new uses of existing
products to new customers, or the marketing of existing products (and their
current uses) to new market segments. The promotion of new uses accounted
for the growth in sales of nylon, which was first marketed as a replacement for
silk in parachutes but expanded into being used in shirts, carpets, tyres and so
on. Tesco, the UK supermarket chain, practised market development by
marketing existing grocery products, which were sold in large out-of-town
supermarkets and superstores, to a new market segment – convenience
shoppers – by opening smaller grocery shops in town centres and next to petrol
stations. The growth of overseas markets in China, India and Eastern Europe is
providing major market development opportunities for companies such as BP,
Vodafone, Walmart and Carrefour (Economist 2008). There are many options
to expand into new markets:
Enter new market segments – transition from business to consumer markets.
For instance, Zoom, which was developed as a videoconferencing tool,
successfully moved into consumer markets, benefiting from a dramatic
increase in both home working and millions of people wanting to keep in
touch with friends and family during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The adoption of online channels has been an opportunity for many brands to
reach new markets. This is a relatively low-cost option, which can offer
extended reach. Retailers have developed online channels, maximizing their
reach to new markets.
Geographical extension into new markets: Red Bull is an example of a
brand that has relied on market development to maintain its market share.
Hosting extreme sports events around the globe has enabled the brand to
continue to sell its iconic soft drinks in a can to a wide range of new
customers. Canadian sportswear brand lululemon has a growth strategy
based on market expansion into different regions, and is building
connections in China and across Europe (lululemon 2022).page 783
The product development option involves producing new products for
existing markets (Ansoff 1957). One variant is to extend existing product lines
to give current customers greater choice. It is important to avoid
cannibalization of sales of the core product. Product types are discussed in
detail in Chapter 9.
Product replacement activities involve the replacement of old
brands/models with new ones. This is common in the car market and often
involves the upgrading of an old model with a new (more expensive)
replacement. For Škoda, the third oldest car manufacturer in the world, product
replacement has been essential to its survival, and in recent years the
introduction of new models – New Fabia, Scala, Kamiq – has enabled the
brand to retain and develop its market share.
Innovation through research and development, and the replacement of an
old product with a fundamentally different one, is where the business replaces
an old product with an innovation (although both may be marketed side by
side for a time). Microsoft operating systems are a classic example of
replacement products being introduced, but the older products continue to be
marketed and supported. For example, Windows Vista, released in 2006, was
superseded by Windows 7 in 2009 (Microsoft 2013), Windows 8 in 2012, 10 in
2015 and Windows 11 in 2021.
Another way of developing markets is to buy competitors. An example is
the Morrisons supermarket chain, which bought Safeway, a competitor, to gain
market penetration. This achieved an immediate increase in market share and
sales volume for Morrisons.
Acquisition of a firm, brand, patent or licences can enable a firm to give
existing markets access to new products. Leading brand Sainsbury’s acquired
Argos and Habitat, enabling the supermarket to bring a wider range of new
homeware products and brands to its existing customers. The acquisition
delivered operational benefits and cost savings too, as Sainsbury’s added
homeware merchandise to its food stores (GlobalData Retail 2019).

Sweden: Land of Innovation
Sweden is a small country with a population of almost 10.5 million. Once Sweden was one
of the poorest nations in Europe, but today it is home to many of the world’s most
successful innovations – products that have had an impact on the lives of individuals. The
European Innovation Scoreboard is an index produced by the European Commission; it
ranks Sweden as the leading country for innovation. The three-point seat belt, safety
matches and Spotify are among the many innovations to have been designed and
developed in Sweden. The country also ranks very highly on the Innovative Capacity Index
(Harvard Business School) and the Global Innovation Index (INSEAD Business School).

Sweden’s success is attributed to continual investment in research and design, its focus on
specific areas in which to achieve excellence (e.g. medicine, bioscience, technology and the
climate), and encouraging young people to become interested in technology and
entrepreneurship at a young age.
In the field of medicine, the first battery-run heart pacemaker that was small enough to be
implanted under a patient’s skin was developed by a surgeon at the Karolinska University
Hospital in Stockholm. More than half a million patients every year are fitted with a
pacemaker to ensure their hearts keep beating regularly and they subsequently benefit from
normalized heart rhythms.
The Tetra Pak is a revolution in paper-based packaging that allows billions of shoppers to
take home their milk and other liquids in a carton instead of a glass bottle. Erik Wallenberg
came up with the idea and it was then produced by Ruben Rausing, who was instrumental
in setting up the first specialized packaging firm in Sweden. Since then, the firm has grown,
and it now supplies more than 8.5 billion packs a year, which can be recycled. The firm has
won many awards for being an environmentally responsible manufacturer.
Skype is another globally recognized application to emerge from Scandinavia. Niklas
Zennström (from Sweden) and Janus Friis (from Denmark) worked with Estonian
developers to produce this innovative software application that enables internet users to
make free voice calls via the web.page 784
The Swedish government has a strategy that aims to continue to foster the right conditions
for the development of many more innovations. The strategic focus for investment in
innovations is medicine and bioscience, technology and climate. The strategy aims to meet
global societal challenges by placing emphasis on sustainability, increasing competitiveness
and creating jobs in the knowledge economy, and increasing the efficiency of public
services. The Swedish government is aiming to create the best possible conditions for
innovation by enabling people to be innovative, investing in research and higher education,
and creating an infrastructure that provides solid foundations for the future. The strategy
extends beyond business and to the heart of innovation in schools. Finn upp is a
programme that brings Sweden’s successful entrepreneurs and innovators together with
young people in schools. Ung Företagsamhet (junior achievement) is another school-based

The entry into new markets (diversification) option concerns the
development of new products for new markets. This is the most risky option,
especially when the entry strategy is not based on the core competences of the
business. However, it can also be the most rewarding, as exemplified by
Honda’s move from motorcycles to cars (based on its core competences in
engines), and Apple, which has created one of the world’s most successful
brands following a diversification strategy from computers to the launch of the
iPod mobile music player, followed by its highly successful smartphone and
then the Apple Watch. It is the lure of such rewards that tempts brands to take
calculated risks associated with entering new markets with new products.
Amazon has a large product portfolio operating in different markets: e￾commerce (retailing), Amazon Web Services (AWS) and cloud computing
(B2B technical services), streaming services (entertainment) and devices such
as Kindle and Alexa (retail consumer technology), and has grown the breadth
and depth of its operation through diversification.
Strategies for Growth: Services
Marketing has changed; manufacturing large quantities of products to saturate
a market is no longer a dominant business model. Firms are shifting towardspage 785
innovation, sales and services (Ulaga and Reinartz 2011). Services are
increasingly incorporated into products reaching maturity as a strategic move
to extend the product lifecycle. Services offer a way to avoid commoditization,
for example lift manufacturers Otis and Kone provide maintenance service
contracts with profit margins of 25–35 per cent, which, when compared with a
10 per cent margin from new sales, highlights the benefits of adding services
as an important source of revenue growth. Many firms in a diverse range of
industrial activity sectors are proactively following service growth strategies.
Microsoft has moved from software seller to cloud-based provider of a
subscription service for its Office software. IBM has moved from
manufacturing hardware into becoming an intelligent solutions and cloud￾based platform firm (Kowalkowski et al. 2017).
Vandermerwe and Rada (1988) introduced the concept of ‘servitization of
business’ in the late 1980s and saw this as benefiting all firms. Oliva and
Kallenberg (2003) studied the shift towards services, and found it to be a
deliberate and strategic endeavour to develop new capabilities.
Services are adding to business offerings and improving financial
performance. In Chapter 11, we explored product/service types. Figure 19.11
revisits the idea of the product–service continuum discussed there. When a
firm decides to extend its service offer, it needs to understand the market
conditions and the extent to which additional services will add value.
Sometimes firms acquire other product or service firms to facilitate strategic
development in the direction they wish to travel along the continuum
(Kowalkowski et al. 2017). Böhm et al. (2017) add that the shift along the
continuum is not smooth, and firms experiment with what they are doing and
then how they might expand the service offer. The blending of services and
products has enabled firms to focus on creating competitive
strategies based around adding benefits such as after-sales
services and value-added support services. Apple has developed revenue
streams from services, which account for 20 per cent of sales, giving the firm
greater strategic resilience as sales of devices such as the iPhone have slowed
(Elder 2018). Eventually, firms draw a line they do not wish to go beyond, as
this may lead to loss of integrity to the product/service offer and brand
positioning. For some firms, however, moving out of one area and into
something different makes strategic sense. Nokia for example has shifted its
core offer on several occasions.FIGURE 19.11

Ethical Issues and Products
The final section in this chapter considers the three major ethical issues
relating to products:
1. Product safety is a major concern, particularly in relation to consumables.
Concerns about product safety also relate to tobacco (lung cancer), the
levels of fat, sugar and salt in foods (obesity and heart problems), and sugar
in soft drinks (obesity and tooth decay). Such issues have led to bans on
tobacco advertising, the setting up of independent bodies to protect
consumers’ interests in the food and drink industries, and reductions in the
levels of fat, sugar and salt in many food and drink brands – particularly the
level of sugar in food and soft drinks consumed by children. For example,
Nestlé has reduced the level of sugar in its cereals targeted at children and
reformulated its Rowntree range of children’s sweets to make them free
from artificial flavours and colours. The UK government introduced a sugar
tax on soft drinks, which has encouraged many more leading brands to cut
the sugar content of these products. For example, Coca-Cola has developed
many new products to target the low-sugar markets (e.g. vitaminwater, Fuze,
Gold Peak tea).2. Planned obsolescence: Some products are not designed to last a long time.
From the producer’s point of view this is sensible, as it creates a repeat￾purchase situation. Hence consumer electronics break and are superseded by
newer models, clothes wear out and fashion items are replaced by the latest
styles. Consumers accept that nothing lasts for ever, but the issue concerns
what is an acceptable length of time before replacement is necessary. For
physical goods, issues of environmental sustainability and impact on the
planet are changing how manufacturers view obsolescence. In certain parts
of the world, manufacturers must be aware of new laws that require the
repair of goods free of charge during the guarantee period if they are
defective or fail. The EU right to repair policy aims to save money for
consumers and help facilitate development of the circular economy (EU
Parliament 2022). But technology firms regularly introduce changes that
render existing products obsolete, for example upgrades and new releases of
software. Smartphones are a prime example of this: new features are
regularly introduced, and battery life and memory capacity are extended,
rendering older phones near to obsolete. Security also becomes an issue as
the manufacturer does not offer fixes for older phones (Engel 2015).
3. Deceptive packaging: This can occur when a product appears in an
oversized package to create the impression that the consumer is buying
more than is the case. This is known as ‘slack’ packaging and, when the
packaging is opaque, has the potential to deceive. Products such as soap
powder and breakfast cereals have the potential to suffer from ‘slack’
packaging. A second area where packaging may be deceptive is through
misleading labelling, for example the failure of a package to state that a
product contains genetically modified soya beans. This relates to the
consumer’s ‘right to be informed’, which can include stating ingredients
(including flavouring and colourants), nutritional contents and country of
origin on labels. Nevertheless, labelling can be misleading. For example in
the UK, ‘country of origin’ is only the last country where the product was
‘significantly changed’, so oil pressed from Greek olives in France can be
labelled ‘French’, and foreign imports that are packed in the UK can be
labelled ‘produce of the UK’. Consumers should be wary of loose
terminology. For example, smoked bacon may well have received its
‘smoked’ flavour from a synthetic liquid solution, ‘farm fresh eggs’ are
likely to be non-date-marked eggs of indeterminate age laid by battery hens,
and ‘farmhouse cheese’ may not come from farmhouses but industrial
factories.page 786
The use of loose language and meaningless terms in the UK food and
drink industry has been criticized by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). A
list of offending words has been drawn up, which includes ‘fresh’, ‘natural’,
‘pure’, ‘traditional’ and ‘original’. Recommendations regarding when it is
reasonable to use certain words have been drawn up. For example,
‘authentic’ should be used only to emphasize the geographic origin of a
product, and ‘homemade’ should be restricted to the preparation of a recipe
on the premises and must involve ‘some degree of fundamental culinary
preparation’. The FSA has also expressed concern about the use of
meaningless phrases such as ‘natural goodness’ and ‘country style’, and
recommended they should not be used.
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapter Detailed Review
1. Product lifecycle management challenges
Product development and management are done in the marketing environment,
and four forces have an impact on these and related activities: globalization,
technology, environment and the circular economy.
2. The concept of the product lifecycle
A four-stage cycle in the life of a product is illustrated by sales and profit curves,
the four stages being introduction, growth, maturity and decline. It is quite flexible
and can be applied to both brands and product lines.page 787
3. The uses and limitations of the product lifecycle
Its uses are that it emphasizes the need to terminate old and to develop new
products, warns against the danger of assuming growth will last for ever, stresses
the need to review marketing objectives and strategies as products
pass through the four stages, emphasizes the need to maintain a
balanced set of products across the four stages and warns against the damages of
over-powering (setting prices too high early in the cycle when competition is low).
The limitations are that not all products follow the classic S-shaped curve, the
duration of the stages is unpredictable, limiting the use of the PLC as a forecasting
tool, and the stylized marketing objectives and strategy prescriptions associated
with each stage may be misleading in particular cases.
Overall, it is a valuable stimulus to strategic thinking, but as a prescriptive tool it is
blunt.
4. The concept of product portfolio planning
This is the process of managing products as groups (portfolios) rather than
separate, distinct and independent entities.
The emphasis is on deciding which products to build, hold, harvest and divest (i.e.
resource allocation).
5. The Boston Consulting Group Growth-Share Matrix (‘Boston box’), its uses and
associated criticisms
The BCG Matrix allows portfolios of products to be depicted in a 2 × 2 box, the
axes of which are based on market growth rate (proxy for market attractiveness)
and relative market share (proxy for competitive strength).
Cash flow from a product is assumed to depend on the box in which a product
falls.
Stars are likely to have cash flow balance, question marks cause a drain on cash
flow, cash cows generate large positive cash flow and dogs usually produce low or
negative cash flow.
The matrix provides guidelines for setting strategic objectives (e.g. stars should be
built; question marks should be built selectively, harvested or divested; cash cows
should be held; and dogs should be harvested or divested) and emphasizes the
need to maintain a balanced product portfolio. The matrix is criticized for
distracting management from focusing on sustainable competitive advantage;
treating market growth rate and market share as proxies for market attractiveness
and competitive strength; being over-simplistic, as making the assumption that
products are self-funding ignores capital markets; the theoretical soundness of
some of the underlying concepts (e.g. market definition), which is questionable;
cash flow possibly not being the best criterion for allocating resources; and the
matrix lacking precision in identifying which question marks to build, harvest or
divest.
6. The General Electric Market Attractiveness–Competitive Position Model, its
uses and associated criticisms
The model is based on market attractiveness (e.g. market size, market growth
rate, strength of competition) and competitive strength (e.g. market share,
potential to develop a differential advantage, cost advantages). By weighting
criteria and scoring products, these can be positioned on a matrix.page 788
Its advantages over the ‘Boston box’ are that more criteria than just market growth
rate and market share are used to determine the position of products in the matrix,
and the model is more flexible.
Its uses are that the matrix provides guidelines for setting strategic objectives
based on a product’s position in the matrix, and the analysis is much richer than
that of the Boston box because more factors are being taken into account, which
leads to better resource-allocation decisions.
The criticisms are it is harder to use than the Boston box, and its flexibility can
provide an opportunity for managerial bias.
7. The contribution of portfolio planning
The models emphasize the important strategic point that different products should
have different roles in a product portfolio, and different reward systems and
managers should be linked to them.
While the models can be useful as an aid to managerial judgement and strategic
thinking, they should not supplant that judgement and thinking.
8. Product strategies for growth
A useful way of looking at growth opportunities is offered by the Ansoff Matrix, as it
is a practical framework for thinking about how growth can be achieved through
product strategy.
It comprises four general approaches to sales growth: market
penetration/expansion, product development, market development and
diversification.
Market penetration and expansion are strategies relating to growing
existing products in existing markets. Market expansion may be
through converting non-users to users or increasing usage rate. Although market
share may not increase, sales growth is achieved through increasing market size.
Product development is a strategy for developing new products for existing
markets. It has three variants: 1) extending existing product lines (brand
extensions) to give current customers greater choice; 2) product replacement
(updates of old products); and 3) innovation (developing fundamentally different
products).
Market development is a strategy for taking existing products and marketing them
in new markets. This may be through the promotion of new uses of existing
products to new customers or by the marketing of existing products to new market
segments (e.g. overseas markets).
Diversification (entry into new markets) is a strategy for developing new products
for new markets. It is the most risky of the four growth strategies, but is also
potentially the most rewarding.
9. Ethical issues
Ethical issues associated with products fall into three main categories: product
safety, planned obsolescence and deceptive packaging.

CASE 37
UNILEVER’S SEARCH FOR
GROWTH
In February 2000, when Niall FitzGerald, chairman of Unilever, rose in front of his shareholders
to reveal his plans for the most comprehensive restructuring and strategy review to hit the
company in more than a hundred years, there was a sharp intake of breath. His four-year ‘Path
to growth’ strategy was to see 1,200 of its 1,600 consumer brands axed to concentrate
marketing muscle behind 400 high-growth brands. All brands that were not among the top two
sellers in their market segment would be dropped, either immediately or over a period of time.
Buyers would be sought for those that were to be divested immediately; the rest would be
harvested (milked) and the cash generated ploughed into support for the 400 big brands. This
would mean £450 million (€510 million) of extra marketing expenditure put behind such global
brands as Magnum ice cream, Dove soap, Knorr soup and Lipton tea. Local successes such as
Persil washing powder and Colman’s mustard in the UK would also be supported heavily. The
promise was to increase profit margins from 11 to 16 per cent and to achieve target annual
growth rates of between 4.5 and 5 per cent from Unilever’s 400 top brands. Brands scheduled
to be harvested or divested included Timotei shampoo, Brut deodorant, Radion washing
powder, Harmony hairspray, Pear’s soap and Jif lemon.
The analysis that Unilever had done revealed that only a quarter of its brands provided 90 per
cent of its turnover, and that disposing of the other three-quarters would lead to a more efficient
supply chain and reduced costs of £1 billion (€1.13 billion) over three years. As FitzGerald
explained, ‘We were doing too many things. We had too many brands in too many places.
Many were just not big enough to move the needle so we had to focus and simplify. That
simplification would allow us to take cost out of the business.’
Not everyone was convinced. There were £3.5 billion (€4 billion) of restructuring costs (bigger
than most companies’ market capitalizations) and the prospect of 25,000 jobs going. The
exercise would require a highly effective internal communications programme to obtain buy-in
from Unilever staff.
By the end of 2002, FitzGerald could claim considerable achievements. Cost savings of more
than £450 million (€510 million) had already been banked and margins had moved from 11 to
15 per cent. The top 400 leading brands accounted for 88 per cent of sales and achieved an
average growth rate of 4.5 per cent. Three businesses had also been bought. Bestfoods, the
US foods giant, brought the Hellmann’s mayonnaise, Knorr soups and Skippy peanut butterpage 792
brands into the Unilever portfolio; the acquisition of Ben & Jerry’s gave the company one of two
major brands in the premium ice cream sector, and Slimfast provided major penetration of the
diet food market.

Unilever was also busy dropping or selling off Elizabeth Arden, Batchelors soups, Oxo, Knight’s
Castille soap, Frish toilet cleaner and Stergene handwashing liquid. Some of Unilever’s
unwanted brands were bought by small companies. For example, Buck UK bought Unilever’s
Sqezy – the washing-up liquid formerly marketed as ‘easy, peasy, lemon Sqezy’. Also, Unilever
sold its Harmony hairspray and Stergene fabric conditioner brands to Lornamead. Others such
as Oxo and Batchelors were sold to larger companies – in this case Campbells Grocery
Products.
A number of brand extensions were also planned in 2002, most notably in the Bertolli olive oil,
Dove soap, Knorr soup, Lynx (Axe) male grooming and Slimfast diet food brands. The Lynx
(Axe) men’s deodorant was launched in the US, and three new flavours of Hellmann’s
mayonnaise and an Asian side dishes range were introduced.
The result of all this activity was that Unilever posted a 16 per cent increase in 2002 profits –
that is, £1.5 billion compared with £1.3 billion (€1.7 billion compared with €1.5 billion) in 2001.
Sales of its top 400 brands grew by 5.4 per cent, above the company’s target of 4.5 and 5 per
cent. The company invested £5.1 billion (€5.8 billion) in advertising and promotion, up 8.5 per
cent on the 2001 level.
During 2003, Unilever earmarked an additional 20 per cent of marketing investment in its global
ice cream portfolio over the next three years. The ice cream group has a remarkable global
brand portfolio. For example, in the UK, Unilever owns Walls, in France it bought Miko, in
Portugal it owns Ola and in Sweden it owns GB Glace. Over Europe as a whole, Unilever owns
and operates more than 12 different ice cream brands, each with its own strong heritage and
relationships with customers. Unilever has retained the names of its national brands while
replacing original brand symbols with a single heart-shaped logo.
Unfortunately, the successes of the early years were followed by two years of performance
below expectations, leading to the departure of FitzGerald in May 2004. Poor sales and profitperformance was blamed on poor organizational structure, lack of innovation and poor
advertising. Poor structure stemmed from Unilever’s Anglo-Dutch heritage, which resulted in
joint chairmen – one for the Dutch arm and one for the UK – and no chief executive. The
company was run by two boards, and had separate headquarters in London and Rotterdam.
Consequently, decision-making was cumbersome and slow, with the ever-present threat of
conflict between the two groups compounding the problems. The group was also divided into
divisions: health and personal products, food and frozen foods. These were regarded as
fiefdoms under which different management teams managed their products separately in each
country.
Following FitzGerald’s departure, Unilever carried out a strategic review under its joint
chairmen, Patrick Cescau in the UK and Antony Burgmans in the Netherlands. Cescau, the
driving force behind the review, became Unilever’s chief executive, with Burgmans becoming
non-executive chairman. The board was unified and headquarters were centralized in London.
These changes gave Cescau the autonomy to push through the reform needed to get Unilever
back on track. Under the slogan ‘One Unilever’ he dismantled the fiefdoms, which were merged
to form one executive team covering all divisions and nationalities, resulting in the loss of
almost a fifth of senior management. A cull of about 30,000 jobs took place, and some loss￾making factories were closed to cut costs.
Cescau also changed focus from the ‘Path to growth’ fixation with profit margins to boosting
market share. This meant price reductions and the introduction of cheaper product ranges to
complement the premium-priced brands. The Magnum ice cream brand was complemented in
this way, for example.
Cescau also sold Unilever’s cosmetics and fragrances arm Unilever Cosmetics International to
Coty International for £438 million (€494 million) in a move that allowed Unilever to focus on its
core categories of food, cleaning and personal care brands, such as Ben & Jerry’s ice cream,
Knorr soups, Flora margarine, Cif cleaning products, Persil detergents, Dove personal care
products, Sunsilk shampoos and Lynx (Axe) men’s deodorants. This was quickly followed by
the sale of its frozen foods division (Birds Eye) to Permira, a venture capitalist, for £1.2 billion
(€1.4 billion). At the time of the sale, Birds Eye was the number-one food brand in the UK, with
a turnover of £500 million (€565 million) a year and profits of around £50 million (€57 million). It
was also the UK’s second-biggest supermarket brand after Walker’s crisps. Unilever also sold
its North American detergents business in 2008 to a private equity firm.
A greater emphasis was placed on emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil, Russia,
Africa, and central and eastern Europe. Advertising budgets in western Europe were tightened
to fund extra investment in these growth markets. In line with this strategy, Inmarko, Russia’s
largest ice cream brand, was acquired in 2008. By 2009, emerging markets accounted for
around 50 per cent of Unilever’s sales revenue.
Another change in strategy was to adopt a more standardized approach to global marketing.
The company moved from autonomous localized initiatives to the roll-out of innovation and
marketing programmes on a global basis. Power was taken away from country managers and
given to global marketing teams to oversee the development and marketing of new products.
Brand marketing was split into two divisions: the brand development team and brand building.
The brand development team devised a global strategy for each brand, including innovation. A
package of recommendations was then created, usually in conjunction with two key countries.
This was then sent to brand-building teams in each country and they ‘made it happen’ within
local markets.
Cescau also invested in ‘healthy living’ brands to capitalize on the trend towards health and
well-being. For example, a number of ‘healthy’ sauces and soups under the Knorr brand were
launched with no artificial flavours or colourings, reflecting Unilever’s ‘vitality’ positioning.page 793
In 2008, Cescau stepped down as chief executive after achieving what most commentators
regard as a fairly successful period at the helm, transforming the company from a lumbering,
regionally driven bureaucracy into a more streamlined, globally managed
business. However, Unilever’s performance did not match that of Reckitt
Benckiser, maker of Cillit Bang cleaner, whose strategy was to launch brands such as stain
removers targeting niche markets that avoided direct head-to-head competition with Procter &
Gamble and Unilever.
Cescau’s successor was Paul Polman, a former Procter & Gamble and Nestlé man, breaking
with an 80-year-old tradition of appointing insiders. Faced with a recession, Polman embarked
on a cost-cutting programme, including a freeze on management salaries and travel budget
cuts of 30 per cent (replacing travel with teleconferencing), designed to achieve £45 million
(€50 million) of savings. A job-cutting and factory closure programme that began in 2007 was
accelerated, and a global procurement officer was recruited to seek savings by using the
company’s vast scale to obtain better prices. Acquisitions were also made, including the
purchase of Toni & Guy and Alberto Culver (both haircare), and Sara Lee’s personal care
business. The Russian personal care group Kalina was also bought in 2011. By 2012, emerging
markets accounted for more than half of Unilever’s sales revenue. The impact of Unilever’s
brand portfolio strategy was reflected in the fact that 75 per cent of sales were made from its
top 25 brands.
Polman has continued his quest for cost efficiencies and constantly reviews his product
portfolio. For example, in 2014 he sold the troubled Slimfast brand, which was hit by the Atkins
diet craze in the US. Unilever also sold its Peperami, Ragu and Bifi brands as it focused on its
health and beauty businesses. In 2017, the company’s margarine brands, Flora, Becel and I
Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter, were sold as consumers turned away from margarine spreads.
Polman’s third focus was on product ‘premiumization’. By developing premium brands, such as
Regenerate toothpaste, priced at £10 (€11) and Maille mustard with wine and truffles, costing
£29 (€33), together with a constant drive towards lower costs, Unilever improved profit margins
from 12.8 per cent in 2010 to 16.5 per cent in 2017.
In 2017, Polman successfully repelled a hostile takeover by the US food group Kraft Heinz.
Following this, he undertook a review of Unilever’s structures, which resulted in a move from its
traditional dual headquarters to a single headquarters. The initial decision was to move from
London to Rotterdam but this was reversed in the face of fierce opposition from large UK
shareholders The business was also restructured into three divisions with more autonomy and
financial responsibility: beauty and personal care, home care, and food and refreshments.
Months after the decision to relocate to London, Paul Polman announced that he would be
stepping down as chief executive in January 2019 to be succeeded by Alan Jope, the president
of Unilever’s largest division, beauty and personal care.
One of Jope’s first moves was to sell Unilever’s global tea business, including the PG Tips,
Lipton and Pukka brands, to CVC Capital Partners for £4 billion. The strategy was to divest in
the slow-growing tea market and move its portfolio into higher-growth markets. His
expansionary ambitions included growing nutritional supplements, plant-based food and e￾commerce beauty products. He also restructured the company by reorganizing around five
areas: beauty and well-being, personal care, home care, nutrition and ice cream. Each
business group would be fully responsible for its strategy, growth and profit delivery globally.
This was accompanied by 1,500 job cuts at senior and more junior management levels.page 794

CASE 38
FEVER-TREE:
CAPITALIZING ON MARKET
TRENDS
Capitalizing on market trends is not easy, especially when you are going head to head with one
of the world’s biggest brands – Coca-Cola (Schweppes) – plus supermarket own-brand labels,
which also account for a significant share of the soft drinks market.
But Charles Rolls and his partner Tim Warrillow are entrepreneurs, and they were not daunted
by the challenge. Charles built his reputation and business skills in the Plymouth gin industry
and met Tim, who had ambitions to start his own gin distillery. At the time, the craze for craft gin
was in its infancy, but Charles was looking at a different market. He saw an opportunity to
develop the mixer to complement the slowly growing number of speciality gins. By creating the
tonic, which generally makes up three-quarters of a G&T, he felt there was something special to
be done to differentiate their new brand from the market-leading giants. Charles had discovered
many tonics were filled with artificial sweeteners and cheap aromatics. So he persuaded Tim to
join him in his quest to produce the finest-quality mixers on the planet to complement the newly
created craft gins. Their 18-month journey involved extensive travel (the Democratic Republic
of Congo, India, Sicily and Spain), being held at gunpoint and much tasting, to source the finest
ingredients. The journey resulted in the formation of the company, Fever-Tree, the colloquial
term for the Congolese cinchona tree, which produces quinine, the main ingredient in tonic
water.
Competing against such giants may be frightening, but Charles and Tim knew they had
developed something so special it could take on the big brands and win. Since the outset,
Fever-Tree has maintained its decision to use only the highest-quality ingredients in itspage 796
products, and uses this as a clear differentiator from the competition and a key driver of its
brand’s authenticity and credibility.
Insurgent Brand
Fever-Tree is a plucky insurgent brand, with bags of character. It is a small, fast-growing brand
that is outmanoeuvring the big brand leaders. Research highlighted that smaller brands tend to
be more agile, operating with simpler structures, which allows faster response to emerging
trends. Often, small brands use social media at launch, although many later move in to
traditional media to get reach. Fever-Tree followed the latter route, and with its move into
sponsoring the Queen’s Club Championships tennis tournament, is moving in to more
traditional marketing communication methods. But even though smaller brands are flexible and
dynamic, they must also have clear goals.
From the outset, Fever-Tree knew the direction it wanted to go in, and it set about defining its
business with a clear mission statement. Charles Rolls states: ‘Our Mission–To combine the
highest quality naturally sourced ingredients with expert manufacturing techniques to produce
an unrivalled drinks experience.’ His fellow co-founder Tim Warrillow added the vision: ‘Our
vision–To be the world’s leading supplier of premium carbonated mixers.’ These statements
give the company direction, focus and structure for future growth strategy. It is possibly this
sense of purpose, clarity and passion that enabled this insurgent brand to become market
leader in the UK by 2017, just 13 years after its inception.
Fever-Tree Brand Growth Timeline
2003: Charles Rolls and Tim Warrillow have an idea, experiment and create a new brand
made from natural ingredients.
2005: Fever-Tree is launched, following 18 months of testing and travelling the world to
source the best quinine, a vital ingredient for creating high-quality tonic water. The bark
from the cinchona – the ‘fever tree’, which is used in the production of quinine – was found
in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Very soon after this discovery production began, and
it was only a few short weeks before UK supermarket Waitrose began selling Fever-Tree
tonic.
2007: Fever-Tree is launched in the US and Spain, two of the world’s largest
gin-drinking markets.
2010: Direct-to-consumer marketing campaign and adverts in selected specialist
magazines, The Week, The Spectator and Private Eye, helped Fever-Tree doubled its
turnover to £8 million and see its profits continued to soar up 90 per cent.
2013: Fever-Tree’s marketing efforts saw it appear in more locations, from agricultural fairs
to cocktail festivals, and it increased its following on social media networks.
2014: Highly successful initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange.
2017: As the market for special craft gins continued to grow rapidly, Fever-Tree was able to
capitalize on the increased demand for premium tonic and overtake Schweppes – the
established market leader in the UK – to become biggest-selling mixer brand.
2018: Fever-Tree replaces AEGON as the Queen’s tennis tournament sponsor, boosting its
profile and reinforcing its market positioning in the minds of some of its core target
customers. Tim Warrillow has his eye on other key sports sponsorships, but this was a
defining moment for the brand to be able to be lead sponsor for the prestigious tennis
tournament.
2021: Fever-Tree becomes number-one ginger beer brand in the US.2022: Fever-Tree announces its comeback to bars at the Kia Oval cricket ground, where it
will serve drinks from June to September at One-Day Internationals, Test Matches, T20s
and The Hundreds. Fever-Tree overtakes Schweppes in the US to take a 26 per cent share
of the tonic market and become the leading brand, matching an accolade it has already
held in the UK for several years.

First Mover to the Future
As the first mover in the premium mixer market, and new market leader, the challenge is
maintaining that position. Fever-Tree’s growth has been built on tonic water, and coincided
perfectly with the gin revival in western Europe, particularly in the UK, Spain, Belgium and the
Netherlands. This success has allowed it to create a portfolio of 12 varieties that are available
in 60 countries. These include: Sicilian Lemonade, Elderflower Tonic, Ginger Ale and
Madagascan Vanilla Cola. Since its launch, Tim Warrillow estimates that rivals have created 85
‘me-too’ brands but these claim only a combined 3 per cent market share. New entrants like
1724 (named because quinine was discovered at 1724 metres above sea level on the Inca
Trail) and Schweppes 1783, a premium tonic launched to take on Fever-Tree, have not halted
its growth. As Tim says, ‘By their own admission, they’ve thrown the kitchen sink at it, but recent
statistics show clearly who consumers are supporting.’
Drinkers can be fickle and tend to quickly latch on to new trends., but this is not a threat to
Fever-Tree. In 2017, its sales rose by 39 per cent in the US and ginger beer became a new
bestseller as a mixer for use in making Moscow Mules (a vodka and lime creation). Created in
1941, this cocktail is reportedly taking the planet by storm, which is great news for Fever-Tree.
And to the future … Fever-Tree is a successful exporter as 75 per cent of its business comes
from outside the UK and trade in the home market is ahead of market expectations: sales rose
by 66 per cent to £170 million after an increase of 58 per cent. These levels of performance are
funding the company’s growth ambitions. Fever-Tree has entered into a strategic partnership
with Patron to create the first tonic specifically designed to be mixed with tequila.
Again, the principles of the founding directors guided the development of Fever-Tree Citrus
Tonic Water. Members of the product development team travelled to Mexico, home to tequila,
the fiery spirit made from the blue agave plant grown in the hills surrounding the city of the
same name, to source ingredients that would enable the production of a tonic suitable to
complement Patron tequila and balance the spirit’s sweet, peppery taste.page 797
This is not the only innovation the company has in development. Currently, Tim has his eye on
developing drinks for new market sectors and greater expansion in international markets,
especially in North America. Tim Warrillow is quoted as saying ‘there remains a significant
opportunity in front of us across all our regions as Fever-Tree continues to drive
the evolution of the mixer category.’ By 2021, he had achieved a link with the
iconic Smirnoff brand by producing a range of flavoured sodas to produce Smirnoff’s No.21
‘Spritz Up’ cocktail. Fever-Tree has backed this with a £2 million multichannel campaign
alongside Smirnoff No.21 throughout the summer.
This multiple award-winning brand has been voted the bestselling and top trending tonic, as
well as reiterating its position as the world’s leading premium mixer brand.
Questions
1. Discuss Fever-Tree using the PLC model. Suggest the extent to which this brand is
following the classic S curve.
2. The market for craft gin may yet prove to be a fad. How is Fever-Tree planning to protect
the brand and develop markets in the future?
3. Do some desk research to identify all of Fever-Tree’s products and then classify each of
them according to the ‘Boston box’ matrix.
4. Suggest two different options for product growth strategies for Fever-Tree.
5. Explain what is meant by an insurgent brand and suggest how Fever-Tree can maintain
these qualities now that it is market leader in the UK.

Global Marketing Strategy
Learning Outcomes
After reading this chapter, you

rom a marketing perspective the world is becoming more accessible, and
firms and their products more widely recognized, for example Google,
Amazon, Nike and Coca-Cola (US), Adidas and Puma (Germany), Alibaba
and TikTok (China), ASOS, HSBC and Land Rover (UK), and Samsung
(South Korea). But not all brands have such reach, and trading overseas raises
many challenges for firms wishing to export their goods and services. While
new technologies are making it easier to communicate with a global audience,many internal and external factors need to be considered if new market entry is
to be successful. Consequently, managers need the right marketing skills to be
able to compete in this increasingly global marketplace. Firms require the
capabilities to identify and seize opportunities that arise across the world.
Failure to do so could bring stagnation and decline, not only to individual
companies but also to whole regions.
Global expansion and exports are important to all nations and all sectors,
but their contribution to the economy varies by sector. For example, in China
exporting communication technologies, data-processing equipment,
machinery, electrical goods and textiles is important, whereas key sectors in
the European Union (EU) are machinery, pharmaceuticals, chemicals,
computers, electronics and motor vehicles, and in the UK machinery, cars, oil,
pharmaceuticals and manufactured goods (Eurostat 2022; OEC 2022).
The importance of international trade is reflected in the support provided
by governmental bodies set up to encourage and aid export activities. In the
UK, the Department for International Trade (DIT) is a government body that
works with UK-based businesses to help them succeed in overseas markets.
Whether businesses are trying to establish a new business or exporting to a
new country, the DIT offers various services, including expert advice on
international trade and export, taking part in trade fairs and outward trade
missions, providing market intelligence, identifying international business
opportunities, helping to develop international business relationships, and
trading with integrity (DIT 2018). Similarly, in the EU the trade department of
the European Commission sets trade policies and trade relations with the rest
of the world. The World Trade Organization (WTO, www.wto.org) operates at
an intergovernmental level to encourage trade across global nations, helping
producers, importers and exporters.
This chapter explores global marketing and its challenges, and is organized
around the key issues associated with developing global marketing strategies:
whether to go global or stay domestic
the factors that impact on the selection of countries in which to market
foreign market-entry strategies
the options available for firms developing global marketing strategies.
It also builds on earlier chapters and considers how the principles of marketing
might be applied in a global marketplace.

HIDDEN GEM 20.1
Innovative, Disruptive and Full of Personality: Monkey
Shoulder Creates a New Global Drinks Market
World differentiation
Monkey shoulder is a whisky blended to differentiate it from other similar products; it is
made for mixing. By challenging perceptions about whisky, redefining the product as a key
ingredient for cocktails, and through a creative, innovative differentiation-focused marketing
strategy, it has become the award-winning market leader in the blended malt whisky
category it created.

Background
William Grant, a Scottish distiller since 1887, is still a family-owned business. Early in 2000,
its marketing team identified as an international market growth opportunity. The
strategy was to reach a wider audience by introducing whisky (traditionally
consumed with water or over ice) to cocktail drinkers. First came product development …
Product development
By blending only malt whiskies, the team not only created an innovative product but also
invented a new product category of Scotch whisky, namely ‘blend of malts’. Initially made
with brands from Grant’s Speyside distillery (Balvenie, Glenfiddich and Kininvie), using 100
per cent malt whisky, the Monkey Shoulder Original product line was developed and
subsequently launched in 2005 in the UK and France. Smokey Monkey came later.
A brand new name
Originally called Batch 27, the marketing team devised the name Monkey Shoulder and
positioned monkeys in groups of three in different places on the bottle (the shoulder, lid and
base) to reinforce this brand identity. The origin of the name – and the whisky itself – is
unusual. It comes from the 500-year-old labour-intensive distillation process and refers to
the lump that developed on the back and shoulders of workers after shovelling barley, which
needed to be turned manually during the germination phase to ensure the cereal did notpage 802
stick together. In the past no machines were used and the work was a literally back￾breaking, demanding job. The whisky’s marketing team wanted the name for the brand to
be deeply connected to its roots but with scope for growing the product an exuberant
market positioning.
Marketing strategy
The marketing opportunity was to enter a market dominated by other sprits, taking on rival
spirits like vodka, gin and rum, to turn Monkey Shoulder into the number-one trendy cocktail
mixer by positioning it as a non-traditional whisky, and targeting a large market of non￾whisky drinkers: new drinkers aged 25–35, confident, free-thinking, adventurous individuals.
The marketing team created a fan base of followers who bought into the brand’s tagline
‘100% Malt Whisky Made for Mixing’.
The marketing strategy was a slow and sure approach. The marketing team built trust and
developed the on-trade sector (where drinks are consumed on the premises, in bars,
restaurants and hotels, and suchlike) by building relationships with bartenders, generating
word of mouth and building a brand support network of brand ambassadors. To spread the
word further, the branding team, working with ACA Live (a creative brand experience and
production agency) launched a series of exclusive events.
The first UK event, a 1920s speakeasy-style party in an eighteenth-century mansion, invited
500 guests, had private card games, billiards, a lounge bar and other related experiences
all designed to fit with the brand. Next, at the annual bartenders’ conference, 40 of the best
were given a glamping experience, which aimed to convert them into fans of the whisky.
The following year, the Monkey Shoulder Tree House was used to attract the attention of
consumers at festivals across the UK. Such festival events linked the brand with music and
fun.
France was a natural market to enter as the French love malt whisky, drinking more per
head than any other nation in the world at an average of 2.15 litres per annum. While
France has its own distilleries, total production is currently around the output of a medium￾sized Scottish distillery, meaning there was large market to target; currently Monkey
Shoulder has built up an 8.8 per cent share of the country’s malt whisky market. Also, by
targeting high-profile bar locations like Ritz Paris, foundations were established that Monkey
Shoulder cocktails were an on-trend, must-have drink. Brand ambassadors helped to get
the message out in the on-trade. An important element of the marketing strategy was
creating memories and experiences for consumers.
Further international promotion
Monkey Shoulder burst onto new international markets with similarly innovative campaign
activations (like the Monkey Mixer in the accompanying image), and creative messaging
that included branded distillery trips, toolkits and summer parties. By 2015, the brand was
working in 15 world markets, but its focus remained on keeping the attention of bartenders
and brand ambassadors, with events like the Champion of Champions competition that
brought together leading bartenders from these markets to compete to become the Ultimate
Bartender. This proved so popular it became an annual event. In 2022, the Ultimate
Bartender Championship was held in India, with 800 bartenders competing for the title in
eight cities from Delhi, Gurugram and Hyderabad to Goa. The SWAT (Scotch Whisky
Ambassadors Team), a special force of elite bartenders, had the aim of entertaining and
supporting bartenders, and continuing to drive the on-trade.
Monkey Shoulder was launched in the US with a similar approach, using marketing events,
for example. The Monkey Shoulder Mixer (inspired by a cement mixer) arrived at
promotional event in Arizona and selected cities around the US. The mixercould hold 2,400 gallons (10,910 litres) and had a rotating drum, enabling it to serve up
Monkey Shoulder cocktails on a very grand scale.
With Monkey Shoulder, William Grant seized on a market opportunity, changing the nature
of whisky drinking but never losing sight of the origins of its core product, the importance of
relationships and the role of enduring customer experiences in building a global brand.

Deciding When to Go Global and When
to Stay Local
Some firms do not look to compete internationally. They know their domestic
markets well, and if they chose to go global they would have to come to terms
with the customs, languages, tariff regulations and transport systems of other
countries, and with trading in foreign currencies. Furthermore, their products
might require significant modifications to meet foreign regulations and
different customer preferences. So, why do companies choose to market
overseas? There are seven triggers for global expansion (see Figure 20.1).
FIGURE 20.1
Drivers of global expansionSource: phM2019/Shutterstock
Saturated local markets
The pressure to raise sales and profits, coupled with few opportunities to
expand in current domestic markets, provides one condition for international
expansion. In Germany – home of supermarket brand Aldi, where it has 2,200
stores – shoppers on average live just 15 minutes from the nearest store. In
1980, faced with saturated domestic markets, the retailer began to expand
internationally: first Austria, then more widely across Europe (e.g. Belgium,
the Netherlands, France, the UK), then to the US. Aldi has more than 10,000
stores globally and has recently entered Chinese markets, where it currently
has 26 stores (Aldi 2022).
Many of the foreign expansion plans of European supermarket chains are
fuelled by the desire to take a proven retailing formula out of their saturated
domestic market into new overseas markets. Currently, many retailers,
including Carrefour, Walmart and Tesco, are focusing on emerging markets in
India and Asia, and looking at expansion opportunities with existing formats or
new offerings. But it is not just supermarket retailers who use international
expansion to grow their firms. Made.com, the online retailer seeking to disrupt
the furniture industry, attributes part of its growing success to market
expansion into France, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, and has plans
to expand to regions outside Europe (Made.com 2022).page 803
Small local markets
In some industries, survival means broadening scope beyond small national
markets to the international arena. For example, Philips and Electrolux
(manufacturers of electrical goods) could not compete against the strength of
global competitors by servicing their small domestic markets alone.
For them, internationalization was not just an option – it was a
fundamental condition for survival. Electrolux expanded its business globally,
boosted by major acquisitions of firms such as Granges (Sweden), Vos
(Denmark), Zanussi (Italy), White (US), Thorn EMI (UK), Lehel (Hungary)
and AEG (Germany). Over time, these and other acquisitions, along with the
firm’s organic growth in domestic markets, enabled Electrolux to grow its
business capabilities and product ranges, and increase sales significantly to
become a highly successful global brand (Fagerfjall 2018).
Low-growth local markets
Often recession at home provides the spur to seek new marketing opportunities
in more buoyant overseas economies. Luxury car manufacturers Mercedes,
Audi and BMW exploited the demand for luxury cars in China while home
markets in Europe were experiencing slow growth. BMW has enjoyed high
sales growth in China, with sales rising by 76 per cent compared with 13 per
cent in Europe, although, more recently, this rate has begun to slow due to
challenges in the supply chain and uncertainty over changes to import tariffs.
VW has reported very strong growth and profit increases in China. The vehicle
manufacturer delivered more than 3.1 million cars into the Chinese market in
2017 – through its own brand and two joint ventures – which was approaching
12.8 per cent of the total number of cars sold in 2017. Indeed, growth in
Chinese markets continues to drive VW’s aspirations to become the world’s
largest car manufacturer, with market opportunities in the SUV and EV
segments (Attwood 2018).
Customer drivers
Customer-driven factors may also affect the decision to go global. In some
industries, customers may expect their suppliers to have an international
presence. This is increasingly common in advertising, with clients requiring
their agencies to coordinate worldwide campaigns. A second customer-orientated factor is the need to internationalize operations in response to
customers expanding abroad.
Competitive forces
There is a substantial body of research which suggests that when several
companies in an industry trade internationally, others feel obliged to follow
suit to maintain their relative size and growth rate (see Aharoni 1966;
Knickerbocker 1973; Agarwal and Ramaswami 1992). This is particularly true
in oligopolistic industries, which are dominated by a small number of large
brands. We can see evidence of this from the earlier example of luxury car
manufacturers entering China (e.g. Audi, Mercedes, BMW). A second
competitive factor may be the desire to attack, in a firm’s own home market,
an overseas competitor that has entered its domestic market. This may make
strategic sense if the competitor is funding its overseas expansion from a
relatively attractive home base. Chinese car manufacturer Geely invested in
Volvo cars and trucks, enabling that Swedish brand to become a significant
global brand. Geely invests in technology and innovation, which is key to its
growth strategy, and benefits in its home markets from tax incentives,
especially in the new-energy vehicle sector. It also owns part of Proton, the
Malaysian car business, and the London (black cab) taxi business (Tovey
2017).
Cost factors
High national labour costs, shortages of skilled workers and rising energy
charges can raise domestic costs to uneconomical levels. These factors may
stimulate moves towards foreign direct investment in lower-cost areas such as
China, Taiwan, South Korea, and central and eastern Europe. Expanding into
foreign markets can also reduce costs by gaining economies of scale through
an enlarged customer base.
Portfolio balance
Marketing in a variety of regions provides the opportunity to achieve portfolio
balance, as each region may be experiencing different growth rates. At any one
time, China, the US, Japan and individual European and Far Eastern countries
will be enjoying varying growth rates. By marketing in a selection ofpage 804
countries, the problems of recession in some countries can be balanced by the
opportunities for growth in others.
Deciding Which Markets to Enter
Having made the commitment to enter international territories, marketing
managers require the analytical skills necessary to pick those countries and
regions that are most attractive for overseas operations. There are various
factors that govern this decision to enter a foreign market. These are shown in
Figure 20.2.
FIGURE 20.2
Selecting international markets

Macroenvironmental issues
These consist of economic, socio-cultural and political-legal technological
influences on market choice.
Economic influencespage 805
A country’s size, per capita income, stage of economic development,
infrastructure, and exchange rate stability and conversion affect its
attractiveness for international business expansion. Small markets may not
justify setting up a distribution and marketing system to supply goods and
services. Low per capita income will affect the type of product that may sell in
that country. The market may be very unattractive for car manufacturers, but
feasible for bicycle producers. Less developed countries in the early stages of
economic development may demand inexpensive agricultural tools but not
computers. Research into the decision to enter a new foreign market found that
the extent to which a country had a developed economy was an important
influencing factor (Whitelock and Jobber 2004). Research also found intensity
of competition, controls on quality and international competitiveness to be
important (Isa et al. 2014).
The economic changes that have taken place globally have had varying
effects on each country’s attractiveness. For example, China has become the
world’s second-largest economy; it has shifted from being a centrally planned
to a market-based economy, and this has aided both economic and social
development. Direct foreign investment is on the increase, as cumbersome
administrative procedures have been relaxed and financial controls liberalized.
Another economic consideration is a nation’s infrastructure. This
comprises its transportation structures (roads, railways, airports), information
technology and communication systems (broadband, mobile, telephone,
television, the press, radio) and energy supplies (electricity, gas, nuclear). A
poor infrastructure may limit a country’s ability to manufacture, advertise and
distribute goods, and to provide adequate service backup; some central and
eastern European countries suffer because of this. In other areas of Europe,
infrastructure improvements are enhancing the movement of goods, for
example the Eurotunnel linking the UK with mainland Europe, and the
Øresund Bridge and Drogden Tunnel connecting Sweden and Denmark.
Finally, exchange rate stability and conversion may affect market choice. A
country that has an unstable exchange rate or one where it is difficult to
convert to hard currencies such as the dollar or euro may be considered too
risky to enter. Equally important are exchange rates, as countries can find that
their goods become too expensive in export markets if their currency rates are
high.Socio-cultural influences
Differences in socio-cultural factors between countries are often termed
psychic distance. These are the barriers created by cultural disparities between
the home country and the host country, and the problems of communication
resulting from differences in social perspectives, attitudes and language
(Litvak and Banting 1968). This psychic distance can have an important effect
on selection. International marketers sometimes choose countries that are
psychically similar to their own to begin their overseas operations. This has a
rationale in that barriers of language, customs and values are lower. It also
means that less time and effort is required to develop successful business
relationships (Conway and Swiff 2000). Research looking at Swedish
manufacturing companies showed that they often begin by entering new
markets that are psychically close – both culturally and geographically – and
gain experience in these countries before expanding operations abroad into
more distant markets (Johanson and Vahlne 1977). This has also been found to
be the case for service companies that move from culturally similar foreign
markets into less familiar markets as their experience grows (Erramilli 1991).
In addition, history, religion and culture have also been found to influence
the attractiveness of a global market and competitive positioning (Prasad
2011). Greater knowledge of the history of a country, and the resulting culture
and economic performance, can assist marketing managers in developing a
better understanding of the social fabric of a new market. For example, Indian
supermarkets do not display as many varieties of individual products such as
bread as do western supermarkets. Careful analysis of the history of a nation
and its cultural heritage can offer an insight into its business behaviour. There
are also cultural differences in leadership styles in the global marketplace, and
it is important to recognize that leading a global team requires the ability to
operate with different cultures (e.g. eastern and western) to achieve the best
outcomes. Successful leadership styles can also vary. According to research,
US and Chinese approaches often appear incompatible, for example Americans
tend to view Chinese negotiators as inefficient and indirect, while the Chinese
see American negotiators as aggressive and impersonal (Salacuse 2004).
Hofstede (1983; Hofstede et al. 2010) worked on cultural and national
differences and found dimensions important to understanding variance in
culture-based behaviour, with implications for leadership styles (see Table
20.1).page 806

Rinne and colleagues (2011) examined Hofstede’s dimensions and
innovation-led success at a national level and found individualism to be
strongly and positively connected to innovation success. Power distance also
provides insight into approaches to innovation: high power distance nations
find it difficult to encourage innovation as people expect to be told what to do,
while in low power distance nations they expect to be included and consulted,
and for everyone to have equal opportunities. This study highlighted the
importance of understanding the impact of culture when leading innovational
developments and suggests how the national culture can influence the
behaviours of different nations.Political-legal influences
Political factors that have implications for global marketing are the general
attitudes of foreign governments to imports and foreign direct investment,
political stability, governmental policies and trade barriers. Negative attitudes
towards foreign companies may also discourage imports and investment
because of the threat of protectionism and expropriation of assets (the taking
by the state of private property for public purposes, normally without
compensation). Positive governmental attitudes can be reflected in the
willingness to grant subsidies to overseas companies to invest in a country, and
a willingness to cut through bureaucratic procedures to assist foreign
companies and their imports. The willingness of the UK government to grant
investment incentives to Japanese companies was a factor in Nissan, Honda
and Toyota setting up production facilities in the UK. The UK’s decision to
leave the EU has increased uncertainty and reduced firms’ willingness to invest
(Bloom et al. 2019).
Countries with a history of political instability may be avoided because of
the inevitable uncertainty regarding their future. Countries such as Iraq and
Lebanon have undoubtedly suffered because of their respective political
situations. Conflict between Russia and Ukraine has increased economic
uncertainty across the globe, and at an individual firm level has exacerbated
concerns about inflation, employment and investment in future growth (Anayl
et al. 2022).
Government policies can also influence market entry. For example, the
Chinese government still operates censorship of information, which can act as
a barrier to entry, especially for media- and information-based web companies.
YouTube, Twitter and Facebook are blocked from accessing Chinese
consumers, although foreign visitors can access these platforms in some of the
southern islands, which are also a free-trade zone (Chan 2018).
Finally, a major consideration when deciding which countries to enter will
be the level of tariff barriers. Undoubtedly, the threat of tariff barriers to
imports to the countries of the EU has encouraged US and Japanese foreign
direct investment into Europe. Within the single market, the removal of trade
barriers is making international trade in Europe more attractive, as not only do
tariffs fall but also the need to modify products to cater for national regulations
and restrictions is reduced. Read Mini Case 20.1 to find out more about how

Amazon Helps Companies Grow Their Businesses Around
the Globe
Online companies like eBay and Amazon pioneered the development of global markets.
Together they have hundreds of millions of active accounts for buyers and sellers, which
generate billions of dollars of revenue. These marketplaces have also enabled more
companies (and even individuals) to trade in foreign markets than ever before, and have
fostered the development of other trading platforms, for example La Redoute (France),
Rakuten (Japan) and Alibaba (China).

Amazon actively trades in 13 global marketplaces in the US, Europe, India and Asia, and
takes a proactive role in encouraging and helping its sellers to trade around the world. While
developing its global digital marketplace, it has accumulated knowledge about how to
succeed in distance selling, especially when crossing national boundaries. Amazon now
shares this information to help its own customers trade in foreign markets.
The Amazon marketplaces provide companies with advice for sellers – large and small –
about what is required when trading in different parts of the world. Amazon has a four-step
plan that guides sellers through the international selling process. This plan involves:
1. Deciding what and where to sell. Amazon operates country-specific marketplaces in
three broad regions: North America, Europe and Asia. Each region has country-specific
domains, for example Amazon.ca (Canada), Amazon.de (Germany), Amazon.co.jp
(Japan). A seller simply chooses a region in which to sell, and registers with the
particular marketplace; the seller then has access to customers in that region.
Consideration should be given to the types of products that are to be sold, to ensure
they comply with country-specific laws and standards. Amazon even provides its sellers
with help with languages, and coaching in how to maximize selling opportunities.page 807
2. Setting up and registering an account. The seller sets up a seller central account,
establishes payment methods and begins listing products for sale. The Amazon
marketplace then acts as a gateway to the global market, making it easier for sellers
that are new to international trade to access these markets. Once steps 1 and 2 are
complete, a seller is then ready to prepare for step 3 and can begin trading in foreign
markets.
3. Shipping and fulfilment of global orders. No matter where in the world buyers live, they
will want to receive the goods they purchase in a timely and secure fashion. Amazon
marketplace sellers can arrange their own methods of delivery or use Amazon’s
fulfilment service. With the latter option, Amazon helps sellers with the complexities of
exporting and importing around the globe.
4. Managing global business and providing customer support and returns. Amazon is a
highly customer-centric firm, and as such insists that sellers provide high-quality after￾sales support, returns policies and procedures.
Amazon also provides some country-specific guidance on tax laws, duties and selling
restrictions, but advises that sellers must ensure they are fully aware of legal and industry
requirements.
Arguably, Amazon and similar international digital marketplaces are lowering the entry
barriers for international trade by providing access to global markets, but political and legal
barriers remain and must be recognized by all companies wishing to trade in global
markets.
Questions:
1. Visit Amazon services at http://services.amazon.com/global-selling and then, using
the information provided, select a region – a country-specific domain – and suggest a
range of products you might sell to a new market in this region.
2. Suggest what difficulties you might encounter when deciding which marketplace to
enter.
3. Based on your answers to questions 1 and 2, devise your own set of priorities that
companies should consider when selecting and entering foreign markets.

Technological influences
The internet has had a profound influence on global market expansion, and we
have discussed many examples throughout the book of how firms have used
digital channels and associated technologies to grow market share both
nationally and internationally. However, when considering the influence ofpage 808
technology on market entry, it is as important to understand the information
and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure of a nation, as it is
essential – particularly in emerging economies – to understand the quality of
infrastructure in place. The costs of direct entry to such an economy can be
high, not only due to the need for upgrades to the infrastructure but also due to
the high training cost to overcome any knowledge and skills gap that may exist
(Chen 2018). ICT is particularly important for the coordination of the
movement of goods, transportation and global production, and for cross-border
investment (Ngwenyama and Morawczynski 2009). Read Mini Case 20.1 to
find out how Amazon helps support global business expansion.
Environmental influences
Firms face pressure to implement good environmental policies and practices
wherever they are based (see Chapters 2 and 3 for detailed discussion of this
topic area). When entering an international market there are implications,
which could mean higher levels of costs, resources and investments are needed
when adopting a ‘doing well by doing good’ strategy (Falck and Heblich
2007). But, in the longer term, such investments pay off, as they are important
to future economic growth (Martins 2022). In emerging markets like Brazil,
China and India, firms differ in their attitudes towards and investments in
environmental policies compared with those in developed economies.
Environmental and social policies and practices maybe less well developed,
firm practices less transparent and inter-firm relationships less stable than in
developed economies (Martins 2022). This means firms should establish a
clear understanding of environmental influences in the foreign market they
intend to enter as these can affect the planning and resources needed.
Microenvironmental issues
While the macroenvironmental analysis provides indications of how attractive
each country is to an international marketer, microenvironmental analysis
focuses on the attractiveness of the market being considered and the firm
capability profile.Market attractiveness
Market attractiveness can be assessed by determining market size and growth
rate, competition, costs of serving the market, profit potential and market
access:
Market size and growth rate: Large, growing markets (other things being
equal) provide attractive conditions for market entry. It is expectations about
future, rather than existing, demand that are important, particularly for
foreign investment. It is China’s enormous market size and growth rate that
is attracting many foreign businesses. Behind China’s success is growth in
technology markets, mobile finance and the digital economy. Chinese firms
have invested in global technology infrastructure, building data centres,
telecoms networks and marine fibre-optic cables, giving the country the
infrastructure capabilities needed for smart cities and cloud computing
(Dekker et al. 2020).
Competition: Markets already served by strong, well-entrenched competitors
may dampen enthusiasm for foreign market entry. However, when a
competitive weakness is identified, a decision to enter may be taken. For
example, in China there is growing demand for clean energy, and while
local producers of solar energy dominate this market, there are opportunities
for foreign exporters that can supply specialized niche services, for example
engineering and environmental consultancy. Volatility of competition also
appears to reduce the attractiveness of overseas markets. Highly volatile
markets, with many competitors entering and leaving the market, and where
market concentration is high, are particularly unattractive.
Costs of serving the market: Two major costs of servicing foreign markets
are distribution and control. As geographic distance increases, so these two
costs rise. Many countries’ major export markets are in neighbouring
countries – such as the US, whose largest market is Canada. Costs are also
dependent on the form of market entry. Obviously, foreign direct investment
is initially more expensive than using distributors. Some countries may not
possess suitable low-cost entry options, making entry less attractive and
more risky. Long internal distribution channels (e.g. as in Japan) can also
raise costs, as middlemen demand their profit margins. If direct investment
is being contemplated, labour costs and the supply of skilled labour will also
be a consideration. Finally, some markets may prove unattractive because of
the high marketing expenditures necessary to compete in them.page 809
Profit potential: Some markets may be unattractive because industry
structure leaves them with poor profit potential. For example, the existence
of powerful buying groups may reduce profit potential through their ability
to negotiate low prices. Also, technology firms like Netflix face high costs
when entering some international markets, due to low bandwidth and poor
digital infrastructure, which can also limit international growth.
Market access: Some foreign markets may prove difficult to penetrate
because of informal ties between existing suppliers and distributors. Without
the capability of setting up a new distribution chain, this would mean that
market access would effectively be barred. Links between suppliers and
customers in organizational markets would also form a barrier. In some
countries and markets, national suppliers are given preferential treatment.
Firm capability profile
Firm capability to serve a foreign market also needs to be assessed; it depends
on skills, resources, product adaptation, competitive advantage and networks:
Skills: Does the firm have the necessary skills to market abroad? If not, can
sales agents or distributors compensate for any shortfalls? Does the firm
have the necessary skills to understand the requirements of each market?
For example, when VW established Volkswagen Financial Services in the
UK, one of the biggest concerns about locating the operation there was the
availability of a workforce with the right skills. The operation is now based
in Milton Keynes and employs 400 people, who serve 250,000 customers.
Resources: Different countries may have varying market servicing costs.
Does the firm have the necessary financial resources to compete effectively
in different countries? Human resources also need to be considered, as some
markets may demand domestically supplied personnel.
Product adaptation: For some foreign markets, local preferences
and regulations may require the product to be modified. Does the
firm have the motivation and capability to redesign the product?
Competitive advantage: A key consideration in any market is the ability to
create a competitive advantage.
Networks can influence foreign market opportunities. According to
Hilmersson et al. (2021), firms can create opportunities for expansion
through networks that enable the sharing of knowledge and give insights
into novel opportunities.Each foreign market needs to be studied in the light of the firm’s current and
future ability to create and sustain a competitive advantage.
Deciding How to Enter a Foreign Market
Once a firm has decided to enter a foreign market, it must choose a mode of
entry – that is, select an institutional arrangement for organizing and
conducting marketing activities.
The choice of foreign market entry strategy is likely to have a major
impact on a firm’s performance overseas, and different entry modes such as
indirect and direct exporting, licensing, joint ventures, direct investment and
franchising, either in new facilities or through acquisition, may be used (Lin
and Ho 2019) (see Figure 20.3). Each mode of entry has its own associated
levels of commitment, risks, control and profit potential.
FIGURE 20.3
International market entry strategies

Indirect exportingpage 810
Indirect exporting involves the use of independent organizations within the
exporter’s domestic market. These include:
domestic-based export merchants who take title to the products and sell
them abroad
domestic-based export agents who sell on behalf of the exporter but do not
take title to the products; agents are usually paid by commission
piggy-backing, whereby the exporter uses the overseas distribution facilities
of another producer
cooperative organizations, which act on behalf of a number of producers
and are partly controlled by them; many producers of primary products,
such as fruit and nuts, export through cooperative organizations.
Indirect exporting has three advantages. First, the exporting organization is
domestically based, making communication easier than using foreign
intermediaries. Second, investment and risk are lower for the exporter than
setting up its own sales and marketing facility. Third, use can be made of the
exporting organization’s knowledge of selling internationally.
Direct exporting
As exporters grow more confident, they may decide to undertake their own
exporting task. This will involve building up overseas contracts, undertaking
marketing research, handling documentation and transportation, and designing
marketing-mix strategies. Direct exporting modes include export through
foreign-based agents or distributors (independent middlemen), a domestic￾based sales force, an overseas sales/marketing office or subsidiary, or via the
internet.
Foreign-based agents or distributors
Most firms use specialist agents or distributors in some or all of their exporting
abroad. Agents may be:
exclusive, where the agreement is between the exporter and the agent alone
semi-exclusive, where the agent handles the exporter’s goods along with
other non-competing goods from other companiesnon-exclusive, where the agent handles a variety of goods, including some
that may compete with the exporter’s products.
Distributors, unlike agents, take title to the goods and are paid according to the
difference between the buying and selling prices rather than commission.
Distributors are often appointed when after-sales service is required, as they
are more likely than agents to possess the necessary resources.
The advantages of both agents and distributors are they are familiar with
the local market, customs and conventions, have existing business contracts
and employ foreign nationals. They have a direct incentive to sell, through
either commission or profit margin, but, since their remuneration is tied to
sales, they may be reluctant to devote much time and effort to developing a
market for a new product. Also, the amount of market feedback may be
limited, as agents or distributors may see themselves as being purchasing
agents for their customers rather than as selling agents for the exporter.
Overall, exporting through independent intermediaries is a low-investment
method of market entry, although significant expenditure on marketing may be
necessary. Also, it can be difficult and costly to terminate an agreement with an
independent agent or distributor, which suggests this option should be viewed
with caution and not seen as an easy method of market entry.
Domestic-based sales representatives
As the sales representative is a firm employee, greater control of activities
compared with that when using independent middlemen can be expected. A
firm has no control over the attention an agent or distributor gives to its
products or the amount of market feedback provided, whereas it can insist that
various activities be performed by its sales representatives.
Also, the use of firm employees shows a commitment to the customer that
the use of agents or distributors may lack. Consequently, sales representatives
are often used in industrial markets, where there are only a few large
customers who require close contact with suppliers, and where the size of
orders justifies the expense of foreign travel. This method of market servicing
is also found when selling to government buyers and retail chains, for similar
reasons.
Overseas sales/marketing office or subsidiarypage 811
This option displays even greater customer commitment than using domestic￾based sales representatives, although the establishment of a local office
requires a greater investment. However, the exporter may be perceived as an
indigenous supplier, improving the chances of market success. In some
markets, where access to distribution channels is limited, selling directly
through an overseas sales office may be the only feasible way of breaking into
a new market. The sales office or subsidiary acts as a centre for foreign-based
sales representatives, handles sales distribution and promotion, and can act as a
customer service centre.
Digital channels
The global reach of digital channels means firms can now engage in exporting
activities directly to customers (see Mini Case 20.1 to learn how Amazon and
other digital companies are helping with this). By creating a website, the firm
can make overseas customers aware of its products and ordering can be direct.
Products can be supplied straight to the customer without the need for an
intermediary. The internet is not only a channel to market but also a useful
research tool.
Licensing
Licensing refers to contracts in which a foreign licensor provides a local
licensee with access to one or a set of technologies or know-how in exchange
for financial compensation. Licensing is often considered as entering a
strategic alliance. The licensee will normally have exclusive rights to produce
and market the product within an agreed area for a specific period in return for
a royalty based on sales volume. A licence may relate to the use of a
patent for a product or process, copyright, trademarks and trade
secrets (e.g. designs and software) or know-how (e.g. product and process
specifications).
Licensing agreements allow the exporter to enter markets that otherwise
may be closed for exports or other forms of market entry, without the need to
make substantial capital investments in the host country. However, control of
production is lost, and the reputation of the licensor is dependent on the
performance of the licensee. A grave danger of licensing is the loss of product
and process know-how to third parties, which may become competitors once
the agreement is at an end.The need to exploit new technology simultaneously in many markets has
stimulated the growth in licensing by small high-tech companies that lack the
resources to set up their own sales and marketing offices, engage in joint
ventures or conduct direct investment abroad. Licensing is also popular in
R&D-intensive industries such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals and synthetic
fibres, where rising research and development costs have encouraged licensing
as a form of reciprocal technology exchange.
In Europe, licensing is encouraged by the EU, which sees the mechanism
as a way of offering access to new technologies to companies lacking the
resources to innovate; licensing provides a means of technology-sharing on a
pan-European scale. Licensing activities have been given exemption in EU
competition law (which means that companies engaged in licensing cannot be
accused of anticompetitive practices), and tied purchase agreements, whereby
licensees must buy components from the licensor, have not been ruled
anticompetitive, since they allow the innovating firm protection from loss of
know-how to other component suppliers.
Franchising
Franchising is a form of licensing where a package of services is offered by
the franchisor to the franchisee in return for payment. The two types of
franchising are product and trade name franchising, the classic case of which
is Coca-Cola selling its syrup, together with the right to use its trademark and
name, to independent bottlers, and business format franchising, where
marketing approaches, operating procedures and quality control are included in
the franchise package, as well as the product and trade name. Business-format
franchising is mainly used in service industries such as restaurants, hotels and
retailing, where the franchisor exerts a high level of control in the overseas
market since quality-control procedures can be established as part of the
agreement. For example, McDonald’s specifies precisely who should supply
the ingredients for its fast-food products wherever they are sold, to ensure
consistency of quality in its franchise outlets.
The benefits to the franchisor are that franchising may be a way of
overcoming resource constraints, it is an efficient system to overcome
producer–distributor management problems and a way of gaining knowledge
of new markets (Hopkinson and Hogarth-Scott 1999). Franchising provides
access to the franchisee’s resources. For example, if the franchisor has limited
financial resources, access to additional finance may be supplied by thepage 812
franchisee. Franchising may overcome producer–distributor management
problems in managing geographically dispersed operations, through the
advantages of having owner-managers who have vested interests in the success
of the business. Gaining knowledge of new markets by tapping in to the
franchisee’s local knowledge is especially important in international markets,
where local culture may differ considerably between regions.
There are risks, however. Although the franchisor will attempt to gain
some control of operations, the existence of multiple geographically dispersed
owner-managers makes this difficult. Service delivery may be inconsistent
because of this. Conflicts can arise through dissatisfaction with the standard of
service, lack of promotional support, and the opening of new franchises close
to existing ones, for example. This can lead to a breakdown of relationships
and deteriorating performance. Also, initial financial outlay can be
considerable because of expenditure on training, development, and
promotional and support activities.
The franchisee benefits by gaining access to the resources of the franchisor,
its expertise (sometimes global) and buying power. The risks are that it may
face conflicts (as discussed above) that render the relationship unviable.
Joint ventures
Two types of joint venture are contractual and equity joint ventures. In
contractual joint ventures, no joint enterprise with a separate personality is
formed. Two or more companies form a partnership to share the cost of an
investment, the risks and long-term profits. The partnership may be to
complete a project or for a longer-term cooperative effort (Wright 1981).
Contractual joint ventures are found in the oil exploration, aerospace and car
industries, and in co-publishing agreements. An equity joint venture involves
the creation of a new firm in which foreign and local investors share
ownership and control.
Joint ventures are sometimes set up in response to government conditions
for market entry or because the foreign firm lacks the resources to set up
production facilities alone. Also, the danger of expropriation is less when a
firm has a national partner than when the foreign firm is the sole owner(Terpstra and Sarathy 1999). Finding a national partner may be the only way to
invest in some markets that are too competitive and saturated to leave room for
a completely new operation. Many of the Japanese/US joint ventures in the US
were set up for this reason. In this arrangement, the foreign investor benefits
from local management talent, and the partner’s knowledge of local markets
and regulations. Also, joint ventures allow partners to specialize in their areas
of technological expertise in each project. They may also be the only means of
entering a country, because of national laws. For example, in India, overseas
supermarket chains are not allowed to operate as retailers unless they can find
a local partner to own and operate stores. For this reason, Marks & Spencer
entered a joint venture in 2008 with stores operated by Indian retailer Reliance
Retail and aims to make India its largest overseas market (Anon 2022). Finally,
the host firm benefits by acquiring resources from its foreign partners. Now
read Marketing in Action 20.1, which focuses on the benefits of the guanxi
approach to market entry.
MARKETING IN ACTION 20.1
Harnessing the Power of the Guanxi
China’s economy has been growing at an average of a 7 per cent year-on-year increase
since 2000. The country possesses considerable strengths in mass manufacturing. It is
currently building large electronics and heavy industrial factories, and is also investing
heavily in education and training, especially in the development of engineers and scientists.
China poses new opportunities and threats to western companies. It has a consumer
population of more than 1.4 billion people and they are spending their growing incomes on
consumer durables such as cars, mobile phones, computers and other digital technologies.
Western firms such as Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, BP and Siemens have
already seen the Chinese market as an opportunity with the aid of local joint-venture
partners.Source: Rawpixel.com/Shutterstock
Although western companies have made successful entries into the Chinese market, some,
such as Whirlpool, a US white goods manufacturer, and Kraft, the food multinational, have
made heavy losses. Overseas firms hoping to sell successfully in China need to understand
several realities of the market there. First, the country is very diverse: its 1.4 billion people
speak 100 dialects and, covering such a large geographic area, the climate is very different
across regions. For example, parts of the south are humid, while the north is more
temperate. Also, income levels vary considerably between less affluent rural districts and
the richer cities.
Many western firms enter China by means of a joint venture, but they need to be aware of
the different business conditions in the country. In China, there is no effective rule of law
governing business. Bureaucracy and governmental interference can also bring difficulties.
A key element in Chinese business dealings is the existence of guanxi networks. Guanxi is
a set of personal relationships or connections on which a person can draw to obtain
resources or an advantage when doing business. Therefore, guanxi literally means
‘gateway to a relationship’. Although personal relationships are global, the ubiquitous nature
of guanxi in China makes it unique and distinctive to that country. Intermediaries may be
useful in establishing guanxi. For example, if person A wants to make a request of person
C, with whom A has no guanxi, A may seek out a member of C’s guanxi network, person B.
If B provides A with an introduction to C, a guanxi relationship may begin between A and C.
Developing such a network may involve performing favours or giving gifts. For example, a
business leader may participate in a public ceremonial function, or a professor could send
books to a Chinese university. Favours are ‘banked’ and there is a reciprocal obligation to
return them. Three important elements of guanxi are ganqing (emotional attachment,
feelings or affection), renqing (reciprocation and obligational favour) and xinren
(interpersonal trust). All three elements are important in fostering good buyer–seller
relationships.
An important aspect of Chinese culture is the avoidance of loss of face. This can occur
when a Chinese person finds him/herself embarrassed by, for example, displaying a lack of
knowledge or understanding. Chinese people like to gather as much information as possible
before revealing their thoughts, to avoid losing face and displaying ignorance. They value
modesty and reasoning. They also regard the signing of a contract to be only the beginning
of a business relationship.page 813
Guanxi is part of an intricate network of relationships, and international firms wishing to
become a part of this network must work hard to understand all its elements. Recently, firms
are making greater use of big data sources to better understand such complex international
trade relationships. Lee et al. (2022) found guanxi relationships and the outcome of any
business transactions are affected by knowledge of events in the marketing environment
(which influence perceptions), and whether parties are inside the relationship (i.e. in China)
or outside the relationship (say in the US).
Guanxi is important as it delivers greater success and business performance, so for the
outsider it is critical to develop an understanding of the insider’s view of environmental
events and their potential impacts when developing relationships. For example, analysis of
news coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic, the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square
incident and the US–China trade war all affected guanxi relationships. During these periods,
Chinese firms were less likely to enter trading relations with firms considered to be
outsiders. As the news stabilized, attitudes changed, becoming more positive. Firms wishing
to enter China should, then, gauge the likely sentiment based on events in the marketing
environment before embarking on a guanxi relationship (Lee et al. 2022).

There are potential problems with joint ventures, however. The national
partner’s interests relate to the local operation, while the foreign firm’s
concerns relate to the totality of its international operations. Areas of conflict
can be the use made of profits (pay out versus plough back), product line and
market coverage of the joint venture, and transfer pricing.
Equity joint ventures are common between companies from western and
eastern European countries. Western European companies gain from low-cost
production and raw materials, while former eastern bloc companies acquire
western technology and know-how. Eastern European governments are keen to
promote joint ventures rather than wholly owned foreign direct investment, to
prevent the exploitation of low-cost labour by western companies.
Direct investment
This method of market entry involves investment in foreign-based assembly or
manufacturing facilities. It carries the greatest commitment of capital and
managerial effort. Wholly owned direct investment can be through the
acquisition of a foreign producer (or by buying out a joint venture partner) or
by building new facilities. Acquisition offers a quicker way into the market,
and usually means gaining access to a qualified labour force, nationalpage 814
management, local knowledge, and contacts with the local market and
government. Acquisition is also a means of getting ownership of global brands.
Such investments do not, however, always deliver immediate profits. For
example, when Tata Motors bought Jaguar and Land Rover, it took several
years before significant profits were declared. This was a risky investment, as
it took Tata Motors into the luxury car market and away from its trucks and
small cars, which were the mainstay of its business at the time of the
investment (Gribeben 2013).
Chinese home appliance manufacturer Haier wanted access to US markets
and, as the world’s largest appliance manufacturer, entered by direct
investment in a factory in South Carolina. However, after many years, the
brand, achieved only 2–3 per cent market share. Its next approach was to make
an acquisition of GE Appliances, which not only extended the Chinese brand’s
foothold in lucrative markets but also bolstered its market share in this region.
Haier’s acquisition was supported by state-owned banks, giving it access to the
funds necessary to outbid all other potential bidders (Townson 2017).
Central and eastern Europe countries have been the recipients of high
levels of direct investment as manufacturing firms have sought to take
advantage of low labour costs. Vehicle manufacturers have opened production
facilities in these regions (e.g. VW in the Czech Republic and Slovakia,
Renault in Romania, Slovakia and Turkey, and Fiat in Poland). Nissan has
plans for an electric vehicle (EV) car hub in Sunderland, UK, worth more than
£1 billion in investment in a new manufacturing plant. There are many benefits
to attracting foreign investment into a region. Nissan says its
investment in EV plant will create more than 6,000 new jobs,
new trade for component suppliers and protect existing investments in the
region (Ambrose and Vinter 2021).
Wholly owned direct investment offers a greater degree of control than
licensing or joint ventures, and maintains the internalization of proprietary
information for manufacturers. It accomplishes the circumvention of tariff and
non-tariff barriers, and lowers distribution costs compared with domestic
production. A local presence means that sensitivity to customers’ tastes and
preferences is enhanced, and links with distributors and the host nation’s
government can be forged. However, coordination between the foreign
investor and the local management team is important and different styles of
management may cause problems.
Foreign firms bring technology, management know-how and access to
foreign markets. Direct investment is an expensive option, though, and theconsequent risks are greater. If the venture fails, more money is lost, and there
is always the risk of expropriation. Furthermore, closure of plant may mean
substantial redundancy payments. However, this mode of market entry can also
protect future market access. For example, UK firms have been establishing
European subsidiaries due to potential threats to access to EU markets post￾Brexit. Financial institutions such as Barclays Bank and HSBC, airlines such
as easyJet and smaller firms have made direct investments into parts of
Europe. The Brexit referendum substantially increased the number of direct
foreign investment transactions in the service sector, although much less so
among manufacturing firms (Breinlich et al. 2020).
The selection of international market entry mode is dependent on the trade￾offs between levels of control, resources, and risk of losing proprietary
information and technology. Figure 20.4 summarizes the levels associated with
exporting using intermediaries, exporting using firm staff, licensing, joint
ventures and direct investment.

Developing Global Marketing Strategy
Standardization or adaptationpage 815
A fundamental decision managers must make regarding their global marketing
strategy is the degree to which they standardize or adapt their marketing mix
around the world. (These options are referred to, respectively, as the adapted
marketing mix and the standardized marketing mix. Pure standardization
means a firm keeps the same marketing mix in all countries to which it
markets. There are compelling arguments for and against standardization, but
the commercial reality is few marketing mixes are totally standardized.
Brands most often quoted as being standardized are Coca-Cola,
McDonald’s and Levi’s. It is true that many elements of these brands’
marketing mixes are identical in a wide range of countries, but even here
adaptation is found (Exhibit 20.1). At Coca-Cola, sweetness and carbonization
vary between countries and products are tailored to meet local variations in
taste. Even the ingredients may be slightly different (Coca-Cola 2022). For
example, the source of sweetness can vary – in Mexico cane sugar is used but
in the US the sweetness comes from corn syrup, which gives a slightly
different taste.
EXHIBIT 20.1
McDonald’s: a truly global brand

At McDonald’s, core branding and advertising is standardized, but
messaging may be adapted to appeal to local markets. The proportion of meat
in the hamburgers also varies between countries and menus are changed to
account for different customer preferences. For example, in
France, McDonald’s offers ‘Croque McDo’, its version of the
French favourite the croque monsieur. McDonald’s also works with Frenchcompanies to offer local products such as yoghurts from Danone and coffee
from Carte Noire, and buys 80 per cent of its products from French farmers.
Even though Levi Strauss is a globally recognizable brand, and its iconic
jeans sell in more than 100 countries it has used different domestic and
international advertising strategies. Recently, and with widespread adoption of
digital media, Levi’s has shifted some of its advertising and positioning
towards very different global markets: environmental awareness and genders.
Its ‘Buy Better, Wear Longer’ is a global campaign to raise awareness of the
cost of buying jeans on the planet. Levi’s is moving towards a circular
economy approach to production and retailing, with tailoring shops where
customers can get their Levi’s repaired, and Levi’s SecondHand, a digital site
where its customers can buy and sell their Levi’s (Segran 2021). And, when
sales of womenswear were slowing down faster than menswear, the brand
developed a digital paid media campaign specifically targeting women in its
northern European markets. The ‘Win With Her’ campaign aimed to drive
awareness, and build longer-term brand engagement using popular artists and
singer-songwriters to connect with target audiences. The highly tailored
campaign succeeded in increasing engagement, delivering 110 million
impressions during the campaign, improving brand perceptions among the
target audience and increasing revenue by 146 per cent (Levi’s 2022).
There are many variations in which elements are standardized and which
are adapted. For example, IKEA’s product offering and stores are largely
standardized; elements of its marketing mix have been adapted in some parts
of the world; advertising has been adapted and prices are lower in China (Burt
et al. 2011). SEAT’s car models are standardized, but its positioning alters, for
example it is positioned as a more upmarket brand in Spain than in the UK.
While the Kronenbourg product is standardized, it is positioned as more of a
premium beer in the UK than in Germany.
Occasionally, the same product is sold under different brand names. For
example, Unilever’s male toiletries brand is marketed as Lynx in the UK,
Ireland, Australia and China, and as Axe across the rest of the world (Unilever
2022). Exhibit 20.2 shows the similarities between the products bearing the
different names of the brand.

How do marketers tackle the standardization–adaptation issue? A useful
rule of thumb is: go global (standardize) when you can; stay local (adapt)
when you must. Figure 20.5 provides a grid for thinking about the areas where
standardization may be possible and where adaptation may be necessary. The
example shows a highly standardized approach to the product and service
elements and brand name, some adaptation of advertising, packaging, selling
and sales promotion, and an adapted approach towards pricing, finance and
distribution.
FIGURE 20.5
An example of a grid to aid thinking about standardization and adaptation of the
marketing mixStandardization is an attractive option because it can create massive
economies of scale. For example, lower manufacturing, advertising and
packaging costs can be realized. Also, the logistical benefit of being able to
move stock from one country to another to meet low-stock situations should
not be underestimated. This has led to the call to focus on similarities rather
than differences between consumers across Europe and the rest of the world.
However, there are a number of barriers to developing standardized global
brands. These are discussed in Marketing in Action 20.2.
MARKETING IN ACTION 20.2
Barriers to Developing Standardized Global Brands
The cost of the logistical advantages of developing standardized global marketing
approaches has meant many firms have looked carefully at standardizing their approach to
the European market. Mars, for example, changed the name of its chocolate bar Marathon
in the UK to conform to its European brand name Snickers. Full standardization of the
marketing mix is difficult, however, because of five problems.1. Culture and consumption patterns: Different cultures demand different types of product
in every aspect of people’s lives, such as washing, eating, drinking. For example,
people wash clothes at different temperatures and so need laundry products that
perform differently. In Europe, where adoption of sophisticated washing machines is
high, along with interest in reducing carbon emissions, there is strong demand for low￾temperature laundry products, for example Ariel Excel Gel with Actilift, whereas in India
the demand is for hot-water products, where Sunlight (Unilever’s oldest brand) is very
popular (Hindustan Unilever 2022). In the US, it is not the temperature/performance of
the laundry products but the floral fragrance that is most important. UK consumers like
their chocolate to be sweeter than do people in mainland Europe. Also, in South
America, hot chocolate is a revitalizing drink to have at breakfast, whereas in the UK it is
a comfort drink to have just before going to bed or when you have been out in cold
weather. In South America, there are two female beer drinkers to every three male beer
drinkers, in the US one in four women drink beer, yet in the UK only 17 per cent of
women drink beer. In China, a fashionable drink is red wine with a dash of Coca-Cola
and, in Singapore, Guinness is drunk out of shared jugs as though it were Sangria (a
popular drink in Spain). KFC has failed to gain a strong foothold in India and this is
believed to be due to beliefs that the chicken did not conform to the expectations of
Indian consumers with its standardized offering of plain fried chicken, while McDonald’s
succeeded by adapting its offering to the Indian palate, for example with the Maharajah
Mac made from chicken and local spices, and also available as a veggie burger. Coca￾Cola also had to change its Minute Maid orange juice for the UK market.
After spending almost two years trying to understand what the British consumer wanted,
Coca-Cola changed its US formulation of concentrate and water to fresh orange juice
without concentrate.
2. Language: Brand names and advertising may have to change because of language
differences. For example, Pschitt! is a soft drink developed by Perrier in the mid-1950s.
If it were to be launched in the UK, the name might have to be adapted because of the
English pronunciation. Coca-Cola had a problem with the signage on it vending
machines in New Zealand, which said ‘Kia Ora Mate’. Which in Māori literally translates
to ‘Hello death’. So rather than developing friendships, as might happen in the UK
where ‘mate’ is a common greeting for friends and strangers, this slogan backfired.
3. Regulations: In the EU, national regulations are harmonized in the single market, but
differences still exist, for example with colourings and added vitamins in food.
4. Media availability and promotional preferences: Varying media practices also affect
standardization. For example, wine cannot be advertised on television in Denmark, but
in the Netherlands this is allowed. In France, advertising of alcohol is strictly controlled,
especially on media channels targeting young people, where it is banned, but this is
allowed in most other European countries. In Italy, levels of nudity in advertising that
would be banned in some other countries are acceptable.
5. Organizational structure and culture: The changes necessary for a standardized
approach may be difficult to implement where subsidiaries have, historically, enjoyed
considerable power. Also, where growth has been achieved through acquisition, strong
cultural differences may lead to differing views about pan-European brand strategy.page 817

As discussed, standardization is rarely possible. Even brands regarded as global, such as
Sony, Nike, Visa, IBM, Disney, Heineken, McDonald’s and Pringles, are not as globally
identical as they may first appear. For example, Visa uses different logos in some countries,
Heineken is positioned as a mainstream beer in some countries but as a premium beer in
others, Pringles uses different flavours and advertising executions in different countries and,
although McDonald’s core food items are consistent across countries, some products are
customized to local tastes. Setting the objective as being to develop a standardized global
brand should not be the priority; instead, global brand leadership – strong brands in all
markets backed by effective global brand management – should be the goal.
Based on: Kirby (2000); Aaker and Joachimsthaler (2002); Luce (2002); Benady (2003);
Charles (2008); Lovell (2008); Neff (2010); Harlow (2018); Roy (2018); Kumar (2020);
Gallopel-Morvan et al. (2022); Hindustan Unilever (2022)
Developing global and regional brands requires commitment from
management to a coherent marketing programme. The sensitivities of national
managers need to be accounted for, as managers may perceive a loss of status
associated with greater centralized control. One approach is to have
mechanisms ensuring the involvement of all managers in planning, to
encourage them to make recommendations. The key is to balance this local
involvement with the need to look for similarities rather than differences
across markets. It is the essential differences in consumer preferences and
buyer behaviour that need to be recognized in marketing mix adaptation, rather
than the minor nuances. Managers must also be prepared to
invest heavily and over a long period to achieve brandpenetration. Success in international markets does not come cheaply or
quickly.
This discussion has outlined the difficulties in achieving a totally
standardized marketing mix package. Rather, the tried-and-tested approach of
market segmentation based on understanding consumer behaviour and
identifying international target markets, which allows the benefits of
standardization to be combined with the advantages of customization, is
recommended. The two contrasting approaches are summarized in Figure 20.6.
FIGURE 20.6
Two approaches to developing international marketing strategiespage 819
Marketing mix decisions
When developing a foreign market entry strategy and when trading in global
markets, consideration should be given to the marketing and service mix. As
with domestic markets, overseas market segments need to be understood to
design a tailored mix.
Global segmentation, targeting and positioning (GSTP)
The world has changed, and big data can provide detailed information about
segments and micro-segments in domestic and international markets across the
globe. In highly developed and connected markets, firms like Netflix, Amazon,
Alibaba and Spotify have successfully used big data to deliver to highly
targeted personalized segments. In some regions, however, internet access and
mobile phone usage is low, which impacts on the availability and quality of the
data available (Schlegelmilch 2022). To begin segmentation in a global
context, geographical variables come to the fore. This gives a
location-based target market, but brands should also consider that
some countries stretch over different time zones, have different economic
development levels and diverse populations (e.g. Canada, China, Russia,
Brazil), and it is worthwhile to consider this diversity as some segments could
remain hidden. In China, cities are ranked from tier 1 to tier 4, being
categorized by population size, level of development, growth and expansion
rates. Tier 2 cities are those that are fast growing with major industrial activity
sector specialisms. Once a region has been decided on, demographic,
behavioural and benefit segmentation applies (for detailed discussion of
segmentation, targeting and positioning, see Chapter 7).
Having identified a location, firms can refine their segment to identify a
specific target market and decide whether to adopt a mass-market approach or
develop a more defined, niche or micro market segmentation strategy. VW’s
recently launched Golf Mk8 has many different options, drive systems, engine
sizes and models, which means it can tailor vehicles for different regions,
customer usage patterns and driving styles (Schlegelmilch 2022).
Positioning raises challenges in international markets as marketers should
develop a detailed understanding of consumer perceptions and how the product
is consumed. For example, Red Bull is sold in Asian markets positioned as a
functional energy drink for taxi drivers and long-distance transport drivers,whereas in Europe it is a trendy energy drink for young, energetic fun-loving
consumers.
Audi is another example of a brand that researches overseas customers.
Audi sent members of its design team to California and China, for eight weeks
each, to live with local families and better understand how they live and drive.
Its research in the US persuaded Audi to put cup and bottle holders on its car
doors. Also, Chinese drivers’ liking for tea led to the installation of a cup
holder in the Audi A8 that can be heated or cooled. Rather than incur the
expense of changing designs for specific countries Audi has made these
features standard globally. The cup holder used by Chinese drivers for green
tea is promoted for use as a baby bottle holder elsewhere.
Once a GSTP has been decided on, marketing managers can tailor a
marketing mix to fit those requirements and meet the positioning strategy
requirement. We will now explore some of the special considerations
associated with developing an effective marketing mix for global markets.
Product
Some firms rely on global markets to provide the potential necessary to justify
their huge research and development costs. For example, in the pharmaceutical
industry, GSK plc’s Zantac and Zovirax could not have been developed (R&D
costs exceeded £30 million in both cases) without worldwide market demand.
Special considerations include:
Standardization: Once the product is developed, the firm can offer a
standardized product to generate positive cash flow, as the benefits of
products provided span national boundaries. Many car companies also
standardize as much of each car model as possible, particularly those parts
not visible to drivers, such as the air-conditioning system, suspension and
steering column. A standardized product is where the brand concept is based
on authentic national heritage across the globe; Scotch whisky, Belgian
chocolate and French wine are relevant examples. Clearly, there are sound
marketing reasons for a standard product, although even heritage products
must be reimagined sometimes if they are to maintain growth and market
share. Look back at Hidden Gem 20.1 to see how the existence of a global
market segment of like-minded people can be exploited by a standardized
product. This is the basis for the success of such products as Swatch and
Rolex watches, Gucci fashion accessories and Chanel perfume. Wherepage 820
brands make statements about people, the worldwide properties of the brand
add significantly to its appeal; this is particularly relevant for luxury brands.
Product adaptations come in two forms: permanent and temporary (Dudley
1989). A firm may produce a fairly standard product worldwide but make
adaptations for particular markets. For example, Mattel’s Barbie doll is a
standardized product for most countries, but for some international markets,
the doll was redesigned to suit cultural features and these were an example
of permanent adaptation. Sometimes, a change is only a temporary
adaptation to see if local consumers need time to adjust gradually to a new
product. This often occurs with food products. For example, when
McDonald’s entered Japan it had to alter the red meat content of its
hamburgers, because Japanese consumers prefer fat to be mixed with beef.
Over time, it increased the red meat content to a level almost as high as in
the US. Also, the movement of large multinational companies to seek global
brand winners can provide opportunities for smaller companies to exploit
emerging market segments. Brand names may require modification because
of linguistic idiosyncrasies. For example, Unilever changed the name of its
Magnum ice cream (used in many countries) to Magic in Greece. In France,
McVitie’s had problems trying to convince consumers the word ‘digestive’
has nothing to do with stomach disorders.
Promotion
Standardized promotional campaigns can realize cost economies and a
cohesive positioning statement in a world of increasing worldwide travel.
Standardization allows the multinational corporation to maintain a consistent
image identity throughout the world, and minimizes confusion among
consumers who travel frequently (Krishnamurthy 2016). As with all
standardization–adaptation debates, the real issue is one of degree.
Language differences
Rarely can a campaign be transferred from one country to another without any
modifications because of language differences: brands can develop highly
creative campaigns to overcome language barriers, for example creative use of
pop music (arguably a universal language) in Levi’s advertising. Coca-Cola isalso close to the full standardization position with its one-sound, one-sight,
one-appeal philosophy. Audi had a different take on the use of language and
used the strapline ‘Vorsprung durch Technik’ globally, which was so successful
it changed perceptions not only of the vehicle manufacturer but also of
Germany (in the UK at least) (Rice-Oxley 2012). Other examples of the same
copy being used globally are McDonald’s (‘I’m lovin’ it’), Johnnie Walker
(‘Keep walking’) and HSBC (‘The world’s local bank’). Research has found
that full standardization of advertising is rare (Harris and Attour 2003).
Usage
Usage can cause firms to find it necessary to manage communications. In
Mexico, Nestlé managed to position the drinking of instant coffee as an
upmarket activity: it is smarter to offer guests a cup of instant coffee than
ground coffee. This affects the content of Nestlé’s advertising. When brands
are used differently in various countries, the advertising may need to be
changed accordingly. For example, Marmite is used as a savoury spread and
often eaten at breakfast in the UK, but in India it is preferred as a cooking
ingredient (Rampton 2010). Analysis of the extent to which advertising
adaptation is necessary can be assisted by separating the advertising
proposition from the creative presentation of that proposition.
Creative presentation
Creative presentation is the way in which that proposition is translated into
visual and verbal statements. Advertising can be used to position brands using
one of three strategies (Alden et al. 1998):
1. Global consumer culture positioning: This strategy defines the brand as a
symbol of a given global culture, for example Benetton, whose slogan (‘The
United Colors of Benetton’) emphasizes the unity of humankind and
promotes the idea that people all over the world consume the brand. Market
research firm Fresh Intelligence developed a measure of global brands to
identify the closeness between brand and country values; this ‘glocalization’
score has been found to be important to the success of brand development in
foreign markets (Sandler and Churkina 2011).
2. Foreign consumer culture positioning: With this strategy, the brand is
associated with a specific foreign culture. The brand becomes symbolic of
that culture so that the brand’s personality, use occasion and/or user grouppage 821
are associated with a foreign culture. For example, Gucci in the US is
positioned as a prestigious and fashionable Italian product, while Singapore
Airlines’ use of the ‘Singapore girl’ in its global advertising campaign and
the positioning of Louis Vuitton as representing French style and gracious
living, are two further examples (Wachman 2004).
3. Local consumer culture positioning: This involves the association of the
brand with local consumer culture. The brand is associated with local
cultural meanings, reflects the local culture’s norms and identities, is
portrayed as consumed by local people in the national culture and/or is
depicted as locally produced for local people. For example, Dr Pepper soft
drink is positioned in the US as part of the ‘American’ way of life. Irn-Bru
also has a strong brand personality, influenced by its powerful Scottish
heritage. This soft drink is manufactured under licence in, Canada, Australia
and Norway, and is exported to Spain, the Netherlands, Germany and other
parts of Europe, as well as Africa and Asia.
Sales promotion
The unwritten rules of doing business are often at variance, too. In the West,
business may be discussed over lunch or at dinner in the businessperson’s
home. In India, this would violate hospitality rules. Western business relies on
the law of contract for sales agreements, but in Muslim culture a person’s word
is just as binding. In fact, a written contract may be a challenge to a person’s
honour (Jobber and Lancaster 2015). Salespeople need to adapt their
behaviour to accommodate the expectations of customers abroad. For
example, in Japan, sales presentations should be low-key, with the use of a
moderate, deliberate style, reflecting Japanese people’s preferred manner of
doing business. Salespeople should not push to close a sale; instead they
should plan to cultivate relationships through sales calls, courtesy visits, the
occasional lunch and other social events.
Digital marketing
Digital marketing is creating opportunities for firms to advertise globally via
the web and social media. Using digital media often means developing
country-specific platforms that are adapted to the requirements of the local
market.Organization and management of communications
One trend in organizing global advertising campaigns is towards consolidation.
Advertisers are either using an agency network where the agency has a global
presence or a holding group that contains many agencies spread worldwide;
both routes provide more opportunity for greater coordination than does
employing different agencies in different countries. This is also likely to
provide the client with the prospect of negotiating a reduction in fees because
of the large budgets involved.
Price
Price setting is a key marketing decision, because price is the revenue￾generating element of the marketing mix. Poor pricing decisions can
undermine previous cost-saving strategies. In the face of more intense global
competition, marketers need to consider six issues when considering cross￾national pricing decisions:
1. Calculating extra costs and making price quotations: The extra costs of
doing business in a foreign market should be considered if a profit is to be
made. Intermediaries and transportation costs need to be estimated.
Distributors may demand different mark-ups, and agents may require
varying commission levels in different countries. The length of the
distribution channel also needs to be understood, as do the margins required
at each level before a price to the consumer can be set. Overseas
transportation may incur the additional costs of insurance, packaging and
shipping. Taxes and tariffs also vary from country to country. A tariff is a fee
charged when goods are brought into a country from another country.
Although tariff barriers have fallen among the member states of Europe,
they can still be formidable between other countries. Firms active in non￾domestic business need to protect themselves against the costs of exchange
rate fluctuations. Nestlé, for example, lost $1 million in six months due to
adverse exchange rate moves (Cateora et al. 2006). Firms are increasingly
asking that transactions be written in terms of the vendor firm’s national
currency, and forward hedging (which effectively allows future payments to
be settled at around the exchange rate in question when the deal was made)
is commonly practised. Care should be taken when quoting a price to an
overseas customer. The contract may include such items as credit terms,
currency of exchange, quality standards, quantities, responsibilities for thepage 822
goods in transit, and who pays insurance and transportation charges, and it
may specify the currency. The price quoted can vary considerably depending
on these factors.
2. Understanding the competition and customers: As with any pricing decision,
these factors play a major role. The difference is that information is often
more difficult to acquire for exporters, because of the distances involved.
When making pricing moves, companies need to be aware of the present
competitors’ strategic degrees of freedom, how much room they have to
react, and the possibility of the price being used as a weapon by companies
entering the market from a different industry. Where prices are high and
barriers to entry low, incumbent companies are especially vulnerable.
3. Understanding how to use appropriate pricing tactics in the face of
increasingly fierce global competition.
4. Parallel importing: A major consideration in foreign markets arises when
importers buy products from distributors in one country and sell them in
another to distributors who are not part of the manufacturer’s normal
distribution system. The motivation for this practice occurs when there are
large price differences between countries, and the free movement of goods
between member states means that it is likely to grow. Firms protect
themselves by lowering price differentials, offering non-transferable
service/product packages and changing the packaging. For example, a beer
producer, by offering differently shaped bottles in various countries, ensured
that the required recyclability of the product was guaranteed only in the
intended country of sale (Leszinski 1992). Another means of parallel
importing (or ‘grey market’ trading, as it is sometimes called) is
supermarkets buying products from abroad to sell in their stores at reduced
prices. In 2002, a landmark legal battle was won by Levi Strauss to prevent
UK supermarket chain Tesco from selling Levi’s jeans imported cheaply
from outside the EU.
5. Transfer pricing: This is the price charged between profit centres
(e.g. manufacturing firm to foreign subsidiary) of a single firm.
Transfer prices are sometimes set to take advantage of the lower taxation
rates in some countries. For example, a low price is charged to a subsidiary
in a low-tax country and a high price in one where taxes are high. Similarly,
low transfer prices may be set for high-tariff countries. Transfer prices
should not be based solely on taxation and tariff considerations, however.
For example, transfer pricing rules can cause subsidiaries to sell products athigher prices than the competition even though their true costs of
manufacture are no different.
6. Counter-trade: Not all transactions are concluded in cash; goods may be
included as part of the asking price. Some major forms of counter-trade are
as follows:
Barter: payment for goods with other goods, with no direct use of money;
the vendor then has the problem of selling the goods that have been
exchanged.
Compensation deals: payment using goods and cash.
Counter-purchase: the seller agrees to sell a product to a buyer and
receives cash. The deal is dependent on the original seller buying goods
from the original buyer for all or part of the original amount.
Buy-backs: occur when the initial sale involves production plant,
equipment or technology. Part or all of the initial sale is financed by
selling back some of the final product. For example, Levi Strauss set up a
jeans factory in Hungary that was financed by the supply of jeans back to
the firm. A key issue in setting the counter-trade ‘price’ is valuing the
products received in exchange for the original goods and estimating the
cost of selling on the bartered goods.
Place
The place element of the mix has been significantly impacted by the growth in
adoption of digital channels (see Chapter 16 for detailed discussion of place
and distribution). A key market decision when trading abroad is whether to use
importers/distributors or the firm’s own personnel to distribute a product in a
foreign market. Initial costs are frequently lower with the former method, so it
is often used as an early method of market entry. Marketers must not assume
overseas distribution systems should resemble their own. As we have
mentioned, Japan is renowned for its long, complex distribution channels; in
Africa, the physical landscape and underdeveloped transport infrastructure
create many challenges. Nonetheless, Kenyan growers have established
distribution networks enabling fresh produce like beans, mangoes and other
produce to be picked, processed, packed and transported to markets in northern
Europe and the US within a few days. An important consideration when
evaluating a distribution channel is the power of its members. Selling direct to
large, powerful distributors such as supermarkets may seem attractivepage 823
logistically, but distributors’ ability to negotiate low prices needs to be
considered.
As with domestic marketing, the marketing mix in a foreign market needs
to be blended into a consistent package that provides a clear position for the
product in the marketplace. Furthermore, managers need to display high levels
of commitment to their overseas activities, as this has been shown to be a
strong determinant of performance (Chadee and Mattsson 1998).
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapter Detailed Review
1. The reasons why companies seek foreign markets
The reasons are: to find opportunities beyond saturated domestic markets; to seek
expansion beyond small, low-growth domestic markets; to meet customer
expectations; to respond to competitive forces (e.g. the desire to attack an
overseas competitor); to act on cost factors (e.g. to gain economies of scale); and
to achieve a portfolio balance where problems of economic recession in some
countries can be balanced by growth in others.
2. Factors influencing the decision as to which foreign markets to enter
The factors are macroenvironmental issues (economic, socio-cultural and political￾legal) and microenvironmental issues, which are market attractiveness (which can
be assessed by analysing market size and growth rate, degree of competition, thepage 824
costs of serving the market, profit potential and market accessibility) and firm
capability profile (skills, resources, product adaptability and ability to create a
competitive advantage).
3. Foreign market entry strategies
Foreign market entry strategies are indirect exporting (using, for
example, domestic-based export agents), direct exporting (using, for example,
foreign-based distributors), licensing (using, for example, a local licensee with
access to a set of technologies or know-how), joint venture (where, for example,
two or more companies form a partnership to share the risks, costs and profits)
and direct investment (where, for example, a foreign producer is bought or new
facilities built).
4. Factors influencing foreign market entry strategies
The factors are the risk of losing proprietary information (for example, direct
investment may be used to avoid this risk), resources (for example, when levels of
resources are low, exporting using agents or distributors may be favoured) and
desired level of control (for example, when high control is desired, direct
investment or exporting using the firm’s staff may be preferred).
5. Influences on the degree of standardization or adaptation
A useful rule of thumb is to go global (standardize) when you can and stay local
(adapt) when you must.
The key influences are: cost; the need to meet local regulations, language and
needs; the sensitivities of local managers, who may perceive a loss of status
associated with greater centralized control; media availability and promotional
preferences; and organizational structure and culture (for example, where
subsidiaries hold considerable power).
6. The special considerations involved in designing a marketing mix for global
markets
The special considerations are where there are huge research and development
costs, where a brand concept is based on an authentic national heritage that
transcends global boundaries, where a global segment of like-minded people can
be exploited, and where a cohesive positioning statement makes sense because
of increasing global travel. All of these considerations favour a standardized
marketing mix. Where there are strong local differences, an adapted marketing mix
is required.

CASE 39
IKEA: A SWEDISH ICON
Building a Cult Global Brand
IKEA is a global colossus built on contemporary design, low prices and an enthusiasm that few
organizations can equal. Perhaps more than any other company in the world, IKEA has become
a curator of people’s lifestyles, if not their lives. At a time when consumers face so many
choices for everything they buy, IKEA provides a one-stop sanctuary for coolness. It is a trusted
safe zone that people can enter and where they can immediately be part of a like-minded
cost/design/environmentally sensitive global tribe.
The IKEA concept has plenty of room to run: the retailer accounts for just 5–10 per cent of the
furniture market in most of the countries in which it operates. It is, however, a global
phenomenon. This is because IKEA is far more than a furniture merchant. It sells a lifestyle that
consumers around the world embrace as a signal they’ve arrived, have good taste and
recognize value. ‘If it wasn’t for IKEA,’ wrote British design magazine Icon, ‘most people would
have no access to affordable contemporary design.’ The magazine even voted IKEA founder
Ingvar Kamprad the most influential taste master in the world.
As long as consumers from Santiago to Beijing and beyond keep striving to enter the middle
class, there will be a need for IKEA. No mass-market retailer has had more success globally –page 829
not Walmart, which, despite vast strengths, has stumbled in Brazil, Germany and Japan, nor
France’s Carrefour, which has never made it in the US. IKEA has had its slip-ups, too. But right
now its 466 stores, mainly in Europe, Asia, Australia and the US, are thriving, hosting more than
700 million shoppers a year.
Why the Uproar?
IKEA is the quintessential global cult brand. Just take its stunts. Before an Atlanta opening,
IKEA managers invited locals to apply for the post of ‘ambassador of kul’ (Swedish for fun). The
five winners wrote an essay on why they deserved $2,000 in vouchers. There was one catch:
they would have to live in the store for three days before the opening, take part in contests and
sleep in the bedding department. ‘I got about eight hours of sleep total because of all the drilling
and banging going on,’ says winner Jordan Leopold, a manager at Costco Wholesale.
Source: Nambaman/Shutterstock
Leopold got the bedroom set he wanted, and IKEA got to craft another story about itself – a
story picked up in the press that drew in even more shoppers. More shoppers, more traffic.
More traffic, more sales. More sales, more buzz. Such buzz has kept IKEA’s sales growing at a
healthy rate: in 2021, sales revenues were a colossal $42 billion, with profits of $12 billion. IKEA
maintains these profits even while it cuts prices steadily. IKEA’s operating margins are among
the best in home furnishing.
To keep growing at that pace, IKEA has continued its new store openings around the world,
with up to 20 per year (although that number has reduced in recent years). IKEA has boosted
its profile in two of its fastest-growing markets: the US and China (the latter now worth more
than $2 billion in sales). In the US, the number of stores has grown from 25 in 2005 to 50 in
2021. IKEA is also investing in emerging markets such as the Czech Republic and India. In the
UK, IKEA has built smaller multi-level city stores in Hammersmith, west London and
Southampton, in response to restrictions on building out-of-town retail establishments. In 2021
it improved its city-centre presence by buying Topshop’s former flagship store on
Oxford Street, creating a new central London home for the Swedish brand.
The key to these roll-outs is to preserve the strong enthusiasm IKEA evokes – an enthusiasm
that has inspired endless shopper comment on the internet. Examples include: ‘IKEA makes me
free to become what I want to be’ (from Romania), ‘Half my house is from IKEA–and the
nearest store is six hours away’ (the US) and ‘Every time, it’s trendy for less money’ (Germany).TABLE C41.1 IKEA at a glance

The Shopping Experience
What enthrals shoppers and scholars alike is the store visit – a similar experience the world
over. The blue-and-yellow buildings average 28,000 square metres in size, about equal to five
football fields. The sheer number of items – 7,000, from kitchen cabinets to candlesticks – is a
decisive advantage. ‘Others offer affordable furniture,’ says Bryan Roberts, research manager
at Planet Retail, a consultancy in London, ‘but there’s no one else who offers the whole concept
in the big shed.’
The global middle class, which IKEA targets, share buying habits. The $40 Billy bookcase, $10
Lack side table and $220 Ivar storage system are bestsellers worldwide.
Wherever they are, customers tend to think of the store visit as more of an outing than a chore.
That’s intentional. IKEA practises a form of ‘gentle coercion’ to keep you for as long as possible.
Right at the entrance, for example, you can drop off your kids at the playroom, an amenity that
encourages more leisurely shopping, then you proceed along a marked path through the
warren of showrooms. ‘Because the store is designed as a circle, I can see everything as long
as I keep walking in one direction,’ says Krystyna Gavora, an architect who frequents IKEA in
Schaumburg, Illinois, US. Wide aisles let you inspect merchandise without holding up traffic.
The furniture itself is arranged in fully accessorized displays, down to the picture frames on the
nightstand, to inspire customers and get them to spend more. The settings are so lifelike that
one writer staged a play at IKEA in Renton, Washington, US.
Along the way, one touch after another seduces the shopper, from the paper measuring tapes
and pencils to strategically placed bins with items like pink plastic watering cans, scented
candles and picture frames. These are things you never knew you needed, but at less than $2
each you load up on them anyway. You set out to buy a $40 coffee table but end up spending
$500 on everything from storage units to glassware. ‘They have this way of making you believe
nothing is expensive,’ says Bertille Faroult, a shopper at IKEA on the outskirts of Paris. The bins
and shelves constantly surprise. IKEA replaces a third of its product line every year.
Then, there’s the stop at the restaurant, usually placed at the centre of the store, to give
shoppers a breather and encourage them to keep going. You proceed to the warehouse, where
the full genius of founder Kamprad is on display. Nearly all the big items are flat-packed, which
not only saves IKEA millions in shipping costs from suppliers, but also enables shoppers to haul
their own stuff home – another saving. Finally, you have the fun, or agony, of assembling at
home, equipped with nothing but an Allen key and those cryptic instructions.page 830
A vocal minority rails at IKEA for its long queues, crowded car parks, exasperating assembly
experiences and furniture that’s hardly built to last. The running joke is that ‘IKEA’ is Swedish
for particle board. But the converts outnumber the critics. And for every fan who shops at IKEA,
there seems to be one working at the store itself.
The fanaticism stems from founder Ingvar Kamprad, who died in 2018, a figure as important to
global retailing as Walmart’s Sam Walton. Kamprad started the company in 1943 at the age of
17, selling pens, Christmas cards and seeds from a shed on his family’s farm in
southern Sweden. In 1951, the first catalogue appeared. Kamprad penned all the
text himself until 1963. His credo of creating ‘a better life for many’ is enshrined in his almost
evangelical 1976 tract, A Furniture Dealer’s Testament. Peppered with folksy titbits – ‘divide
your life into 10-minute units and sacrifice as few as possible in meaningless activity’, ‘wasting
resources is a mortal sin’ (that’s for sure: employees are the catalogue models) or the more
revealing ‘it is our duty to expand’ – the pamphlet is given to all employees the day they start.
Employees at IKEA will never get rich, but they do get to enjoy autonomy, very little hierarchy
and a family-friendly culture. In return, they buy into the culture of frugality and style that drives
the whole company.
Kamprad initiated the practices that define IKEA culture. One is egalitarianism. IKEA regularly
stages anti-bureaucracy weeks, during which executives work on the shop floor or tend the
checkouts.
Prices and Costs
A feature of IKEA is its steely competitiveness. You get a sense of this at one of its main offices,
in Helsingborg, Sweden. At the doorway, a massive bulletin board tracks weekly sales growth,
names the best-performing country markets and identifies the bestselling furniture. The other
message that comes across loud and clear: cut prices. IKEA designers revolutionized flat
packing furniture to ensure low storage and transportation costs.
The montage vividly illustrates IKEA’s relentless cost cutting. The retailer aims to lower prices
across its entire offering by an average of 2 to 3 per cent each year. It goes deeper when it
wants to hit rivals in certain segments.
It helps that frugality is as deeply ingrained in the corporate DNA as the obsession with design.
Managers, even the top brass, fly economy. Steen Kanter, who left IKEA in 1994 and now
heads his own retail consultancy in Philadelphia, US – Kanter International – recalls that while
flying with founder Ingvar Kamprad once, the boss handed him a coupon for a car rental he had
ripped out of an in-flight magazine.
This cost obsession fuses with the design culture. ‘Designing beautiful-but-expensive products
is easy,’ says Josephine Rydberg-Dumont, former president of IKEA of Sweden. ‘Designing
beautiful products that are inexpensive and functional is a huge challenge.’
No design – no matter how inspired – finds its way into the showroom if it cannot be made
affordable. To achieve that goal, the company’s designers at Almhult, Sweden, work hand in
hand with in-house production teams to identify the appropriate materials and least costly
suppliers, a trial-and-error process that can take as long as three years. Example: for the PS
Ellan, a $39.99 dining chair that can rock back on its hind legs without tipping over, designer
Chris Martin worked with production staff for a year and a half to adapt a wood-fibre composite,
an inexpensive blend of wood chips and plastic resin used in highway noise barriers, for use in
furnishings. Martin also had to design the chair to break down into six pieces, so it could be flat￾packed and snapped together without screws.page 831
With a network of 16,000 suppliers in more than 50 countries, IKEA works overtime to find the
right manufacturer for the right product. It once contracted with ski makers – experts in bent
wood – to manufacture its Poang armchairs, and has tapped makers of supermarket trollies to
turn out durable sofas. Simplicity, a tenet of Swedish design, helps keep costs down. The 50-
cent Trofé mug, for example, came only in blue and white, the least expensive pigments. IKEA’s
conservation drive extends naturally from this cost cutting. For its PS line, it challenged 28
designers to find innovative uses for discarded and unusual materials. The results: a table
fashioned from reddish-brown birch heartwood (furniture makers prefer the pale exterior wood)
and a storage system made from recycled milk cartons.
IKEA also made cost savings in response to the decline in popularity of its print catalogue as
shoppers used the internet more to check out product offerings by discontinuing its publication
in 2021. By 2021, 26 per cent of IKEA sales were online, facilitated by a home delivery service.
Adaptation to Local Tastes
Adding to the challenge, the suppliers and designers have to customize some IKEA products to
make them sell better in local markets. In China, the 250,000 plastic placemats IKEA produced
to commemorate the year of the rooster sold out in just three weeks. Managers have been
known to visit people’s houses in the US and Europe to peek into their closets, learning that
‘Americans prefer to store most of their clothes folded, and Italians like to hang’. The result was
a wardrobe that features deeper drawers for US customers.
The US market poses special challenges for IKEA, because of the huge differences inside the
country. For example, IKEA realized it might not be reaching California’s Latin Americans, so its
designers visited the homes of Latin American staff members. They soon realized
they had set up the store’s displays all wrong. Large Latin American families need
dining tables and sofas that fit more than two people, which is the Swedish norm. They prefer
bold colours to the more subdued Scandinavian palette, and display tons of pictures in
elaborate frames. The store manager warmed up the showrooms’ colours, adding more seating
and throwing in numerous picture frames.
IKEA is particularly concerned about the US, since it is key to expansion – and since IKEA
came close to blowing it. ‘We got our clocks cleaned in the early 1990s because we really didn’t
listen to the consumer,’ says Kanter. Stores weren’t big enough to offer the full IKEA
experience, and many were in poor locations. Prices were too high. Beds were measured in
centimetres, not king, queen and twin. Sofas weren’t deep enough, curtains were too short, and
kitchens didn’t fit US-size appliances. ‘American customers were buying vases to drink from,
because the glasses were too small,’ recalls Goran Carstedt, the former head of IKEA North
America, who helped engineer a turnaround. Parts of the product line were adapted (no more
metric measurements), new and bigger store locations chosen, prices slashed and service
improved. Now US managers are paying close attention to the tiniest details. ‘Americans want
more comfortable sofas, higher-quality textiles, bigger glasses, more spacious entertainment
units,’ adds Pernille Spiers-Lopez, former head of IKEA North America.
In 2018, IKEA opened its first store in India, where 1,000 families were researched to
understand their aspirations, their frustrations and what they wanted. IKEA also took into
account their customs, tastes and disposable incomes. Consequently, alongside the normal
IKEA furniture like Billy bookshelves, the store sells locally relevant products like masala boxes,
Indian frying pans called tawas, rice cake makers and mattresses with coconut-fibre centres.
More than 1,000 products are priced at less than 200 rupees ($2.50), and the research
revealed that Indians were averse to assembling furniture, with small, family-owned businesses
usually providing the service. In response, IKEA has teamed up with UrbanCompany, an onlinepage 832
platform that connects consumers looking for an assembly service with tradespeople and also
employs assemblers itself.
By 2022, IKEA operated two stores in India, one in Hyderabad and the other in Mumbai.
Because homes in Hyderabad were twice the size of those in Mumbai, the stores’ product
offerings were different. For example, IKEA offered more vertical storage options in Mumbai,
which has a lot of ‘small space living’. Consumers were also more likely to buy a sofabed. In
Hyderabad consumers were more likely to buy bigger sofas and more beds. The bedroom
displays at the two stores reflected these differences in space and size. Indian people also
prefer closed storage because of dust, so IKEA reduced its vast range of open-storage items by
offering glass cabinets and cupboards instead.
The Future
Can the cult keep thriving? IKEA has stumbled badly before. A foray into Japan 30 years ago
was a disaster (the Japanese wanted high quality and great materials, not low price and particle
board). The company returned to Japan in 2006. IKEA is also seeing more competition than
ever. In the US, Target recruited top designer Thomas O’Brien to develop a range of low-priced
furnishings. An IKEA-like chain called Fly is popular in France. In Japan, Nitori is the major
player in low-cost furniture. ILVA is successfully selling upmarket furniture in Denmark and
Sweden, although its foray into the UK market was unsuccessful.
Perhaps the bigger issue is what happens inside IKEA. ‘The great challenge of any
organization as it becomes larger and more diverse is how to keep the core founding values
alive,’ says Harvard Business School professor Christopher A. Bartlett.
Questions
1. IKEA has chosen to enter new markets mainly by direct investment. What advantages does
this form of entry give it? Why doesn’t IKEA use franchising, like McDonald’s and Benetton
do, as its main method of entering new markets?
2. How would you categorize IKEA’s approach to developing an international marketing
strategy in terms of standardization and adaptation?
3. What are the factors that have helped IKEA to build a successful global brand?

CASE 40
MARIMEKKO: A STORY OF
DESIGN, DETERMINATION
AND LEADERSHIPThis case demonstrates the importance of historic, enduring company values, and strong,
powerful and innovative leadership.
Marimekko is a distinctive Finnish brand, which imbues the country’s heritage and culture. Its
iconic fashion design principles were established by founders Armi and Viljo Ratia in 1951, and
since then the company has become well known for its folk-based approach to design and
creativity. Armi Ratia employed young artists just starting out on their careers and encouraged
them to create striking designs for fabrics. In 1953, Vuokko Eskolim-Nurmesniemi joined the
company and made radical changes to the garment designs, which are still evident today; she
wanted to see clothes that allowed the wearer to move freely. Her radical loose-fitting dress
designs and the unisex Jokapoika shirt launched the brand onto the world’s stage. Marimekko’s
designs were bold and chic, and worn by celebrities around the world, including Jackie
Kennedy, who wore Marimekko dresses during her husband’s presidential campaign in the US
in 1959. This became a showcase for the brand and earned it media coverage in more than
300 glossy magazines, which, at the time, were influential in persuading women which brands
to wear.

An Unorthodox Sense of Tradition
Originally, this was a brand made by women for women to wear, and in the 1960s the brand
was positioned as strident and liberating, and was ‘a component in women’s liberation’ through
its clothes and accessories. Armi Ratia’s values were seen in everything the brand did; Ratia
didn’t use professional models in the advertising, but instead people who would wear the brand
in their daily lives. The bright-coloured prints and wearables became the ‘uniform of the
intelligentsia’. The folk dress became one of the iconic designs, which buyers were encouraged
to wear so that they could relax and be themselves. Marimekko continued to produce unisex
designs and started to grow internationally in the 1970s, expanding through licensing
agreements into Sweden, Japan and the US.
Marimekko designs are infused with a strong sense of national culture, and this is at the very
heart of the brand, from its design stage to the stores. The company uses quality fabrics to
bring ‘colour and joy for everyday life’. Every year, 1 million metres of fabric are still produced in
the company’s printing factory in Helsinki. Unikko, the rebel flower, was designed by Maija Isola
for the 1960s flower-power era – a movement in opposition to the Vietnam War. This design
was counter to the wishes of Armi Ratia, who had declared that they would never ‘do florals’.page 834
But Maija was a free thinker and her poppy design captured the DNA of the company, and has
lived on in hundreds of different styles, homeware products and even shoes.
The energy and passion that launched this brand onto the global stage faded in 1979 when
Armi Ratia died. Marimekko was left without strong leadership and soon lost its direction. The
company fell into a period of decline.
Management Revival and Strategic Vision
Even iconic brands can hit a low spot. Following a period of lacklustre management in the
1980s, Kirsti Paakkanen, a successful Finnish entrepreneur, bought the company in 1991 from
the Amer Group, a Finnish conglomerate. In the €6 million deal, she took over the responsibility
for Marimekko’s €20 million debt. She was determined to save the Marimekko design ethic, and
had a clear vision of where she wanted to take the business and how she would revive its
fortunes. Her two key objectives were:
1. to provide strong visionary leadership by utilising her skills, reputation and capabilities to
‘re-image’ the brand and enable it to develop into a prestige brand
2. to create an international chain of high-quality retail stores that would act as flagships for
the brand; the stores would be a showcase for Finnish design and culture.
Turning around this failing brand required courage, determination and vision.
Following the Amer Group ownership, Marimekko had gone through a period of harsh
rationalization, and 360 workers had been laid off. While this left the company in a weak
position, Paakkanen was able to ensure that the remaining staff understood the ethical and
economic values of the company. She sent memos to employees to constantly remind them
‘You have to trust in yourself. Only selves succeed. World needs strong individuals. How many
statues have been erected to committees? None!’ Everyone was required to work by these
principles, and at the same time cut costs wherever viable and work to increase revenues. She
also took what might seem an unconventional step to ground these values in the minds of the
workforce: she invited postmodernist academics, philosophers and psychiatrists to give
inspiring lectures on personal development and creativity to the staff.
Paakkanen followed traditional values and launched an advertising campaign, ‘Get the masses
on the move’, with more than 70 major design events. These events used ordinary people to
showcase the designs, backed by music celebrities and performers. The Marimekko ‘roadshow’
popped up in parks, on high streets and in the Opera House in Helsinki. Everyone freely
attended the events, giving the masses access to the fashion. Mass-media advertising was
deemed to be too expensive, so public relations events, exhibitions, shows and local poster
campaigns were the mainstay of the company’s communication campaigns.
Paakkanen’s vision extended to the stores, which she visited to gain better knowledge of both
customers and staff. By understanding every aspect of the business, she was able to be better
informed and had a great sense of market demand. She regularly shared this knowledge
throughout the company via computer printouts.
By 1998, she had opened her envisioned flagship stores in Stockholm and Cologne, and then
in New York and London. Paakkanen introduced new styles and gave the brand a more elegant
and empowering look. Her management approach provided the brand with a strong identity,page 835
sense of direction and a foundation that still underpins the strategic vision today: ‘to be the
world’s most inspiring lifestyle design brand renowned for bold prints’.
Design Culture for Living
As tastes and fashions evolve over time, Marimekko continues to use artists who can capture
the mood with simple, clean, colourful ideas, which Armi Ratia had originally felt was at the
heart of keeping loyal customers. Inspired by resonating the cultural values of the Finnish
people, this freedom and creativity has enabled to brand to grow. In 2018, Satu Maaranen
became head designer and carries on the tradition of making iconic ready-to-wear fashion and
bags. Tiina Alahuntta-Kasko, president and CEO, and Sanna-Kaisa Niikko, chief marketing
officer, have been with the firm since 2005. They understand the core values that differentiate
the brand, and they help share Marimekko ideas with newer members of the senior
management team – like Rebekka Bay, who joined in 2020 as chief creative officer, and Kari
Harkonen, chief digital officer, who joined in 2016. The leadership team offers stability, strong
vision and direction for this iconic and enduring brand.
Currently, products are sold in more than 35 countries, from 150 stores, with annual sales
exceeding €376 million. International growth continues, seeing further expansion into northern
Europe, the US, mainland China and Hong Kong. The online store is reaching customers in
over 35 different countries, and e-commerce sales continue to grow.
Marimekko’s design culture reaches beyond its own stores: its fabrics and ready-made
garments can be found in stores such as Crate & Barrel, H&M, Converse, Banana Republic
and Adidas, along with luxury bags by Mansur Gavriel as part of the Mansur Gavriel x
Marimekko capsule collection. In a brand collaboration with IKEA, a collection of fabrics
inspired by Nordic sauna culture brings together prints and furniture designs in a limited-edition
range for 2023.
The brand’s approach to marketing prevails; the fashion show in Esplanadi Park Helsinki
returned following a two-year break due to Covid-19, and linked up online with connected
events. Pop-up stores are linked to the online e-commerce platform to enhance
omnichannel shopping experiences and add excitement to the customer
experience. Joining Helsinki Pride demonstrated the brand’s commitment to its core values of
bringing ‘joy and colour’ to diverse communities. Marimekko Pre-loved is a new online
marketplace launched to sell vintage products, supporting one of the brand’s main sustainability
principles and contributing to the circular economy.
The firm’s strategy implementation focuses on developing further international growth, by
increasing brand awareness, expanding digital and omnichannel operations, and developing
and improving sustainability. Its implementation of the sustainability strategy is driven by three
principles:
1. Timeless designs which delight future generations. By developing the classic designs of the
past, the brand aims to attract younger customers and inculcate a recycling culture.
2. Positive change through equality and fairness across the value chain. Marimekko constantly
seeks to be transparent, providing information about the origin of products; conducting
audits with second-tier suppliers of raw materials and finished product. The firm also
collaborates across the industry to promote sustainable practices.
3. Leave no trace – by initiating projects that reduce CO2 emissions across the value chain,
aligning targets with the Paris Agreement and offsetting emissions, the brand hascommitted to reducing its environmental impact and, as a result, became carbon neutral in
2020.
Founder Armi Ratia wanted the designs to live on and is quoted as saying ‘Marimekko is not
about trendy fashion, with a few minor exceptions. We make lasting and timeless products.
Timelessness may, however, occasionally come into fashion by chance, like now.’ The fabric
designs are inspired by life and nature, and are created into products that people can enjoy
every day. And so Armi Ratia’s vision lives on as creative women have carried the baton and
inspired the next generation to wear Marimekko.
Questions
1. Discuss the importance of the Armi Ratia’s vision and describe how this has shaped the
cultural values of the Marimekko brand.
2. Explain whether the marketing strategy of Marimekko can be considered as good
implementation. Give examples to support your answer.
3. Discuss Marimekko’s sustainability strategy and suggest how the senior management team
might approach implementing changes.
4. Imagine you are given the responsibility for implementing a new marketing campaign for
Marimekko. Explain how you would go about this task.

esigning marketing strategies and positioning plans to meet today’s and
tomorrow’s market requirements is a necessary but not a sufficient
condition for corporate success. Plans need to be translated into action
through effective implementation, organization and control. In this chapter, we
focus on: the importance of implementation for business outcomes; the
relationship between strategy, implementation and performance; and change
management and how people react to change. We explore resistance to changethat might result from implementing a marketing strategy, and the skills and
tactics marketing managers can use to bring about marketing implementation
and change. Finally, we examine how companies organize their marketing
activities and establish control procedures to check objectives have been
achieved.
Implementation and Managing Change
Marketing strategy concerns the issues of what should happen and why it
should happen. Implementation focuses on actions: who is responsible for
various activities, how the strategy should be carried out, where things will
happen and when action will take place. Managers devise marketing strategies
to meet new opportunities, counter environmental threats and match core
competences. The framework for marketing strategy development was
discussed in Chapter 17 as part of the marketing planning process. Although
implementation is a consequence of strategy, it also affects planning and is an
integral part of the strategy development process. The proposition is
straightforward: without a well-organized implementation, even the best
strategy is likely to fail (Galbraith 2014). Implementation capability is an
integral part of strategy formulation (the link between the two is shown in
Figure 21.1) and implementation affects marketing strategy choice.
FIGURE 21.1
Marketing strategy and implementationImplementing marketing strategy
Bonoma (1985) argued that combinations of appropriate/inappropriate strategy
and good/poor implementation will lead to various business outcomes. Figure
21.2 shows the four-cell matrix, with predicted performances.
FIGURE 21.2
Marketing strategy, implementation and performance
Appropriate strategy–good implementation
This is the combination most likely to lead to success. No guarantee of success
can be made, however, because of the vagaries of the marketplace, including
competitor actions and reactions, new technological breakthroughs and plainpage 839
bad luck, but with strong implementation backing sound strategy, marketing
management has done all it can to build success.
Appropriate strategy–bad implementation
This combination is likely to lead to trouble if substandard performance is
attributed to poor strategy. Management’s tendency to look for strategy change
in response to poor results will result in a less appropriate strategy being
grafted onto an already wayward implementation system.
Inappropriate strategy–good implementation
Two effects of this combination can be predicted. First, the effective
implementation of a poor strategy can hasten failure. For example, very
effectively communicating a price rise (which is part of an inappropriate
repositioning strategy) to customers may accelerate a fall in sales. Second, if
good implementation takes the form of correcting a fault in strategy, then the
outcome will be favourable. For example, if strategy implies an increase in
sales effort to push a low-margin dog product to the detriment of a new star
product in a growing market (perhaps for political reasons), modification at the
implementation level may correct the bias. The reality of marketing life is that
managers spend many hours supplementing, subverting, overcoming or
otherwise correcting shortcomings in strategic plans.
Inappropriate strategy–bad implementation
This obviously leads to failure, which is difficult to correct because so much is
wrong. An example might be a situation where a product holds a premium
price position without a competitive advantage to support the price differential.
The situation is made worse by an advertising campaign that is unbelievable
and a sales force that makes misleading claims, leading to customer annoyance
and confusion.
ImplicationsSo, what should managers do when faced with poor performance? First,
strategic issues should be separated from implementation activities and the
problem should be diagnosed. Second, when in doubt about whether the
problem is rooted in strategy or implementation, implementation problems
should be addressed first so that strategic adequacy can be assessed more
easily.
All marketing strategy implementations can be affected by events in the
marketing environment (see Chapters 2 and 3), so while Bonoma’s (1985)
theory gives a good foundation it is important to consider the situation and
context of the implementation and the changes required to survive in the new
context. Now read Hidden Gem 21.1 to see how Zoom has created long-term
implications for the way we work.
HIDDEN GEM 21.1
Zooming Our Way to Flexible Working
In March 2020, the world changed. Covid-19 forced firms to rethink working practices, and
decide how to continue to trade while much of the global trading infrastructure was shut
down and workers were forced to stay at home.
Source: fizkes/Shutterstock
Remote/home working is nothing new. Since the 1970s, research and discussion of
teleworking and its impact on human behaviour and well-being, transport and commuting,
and environmental impacts, abounds. The hope was that remote working would reduce
commuting and greenhouse gas emissions, create a better work/life balance and benefit
individuals and families. But the reality was mixed, as reduced commuting can lead topage 840
increased energy use in the home, and conducting meetings in a busy family home can be
stressful. So opportunities to deploy flexible teleworking working were not widespread and
available technologies were relatively costly to implement.
A big challenge for firms in the early stages of the pandemic was how to implement working
at home on a large scale, at reasonable cost. Eric Yuan’s innovative videoconferencing
platform, Zoom, was the answer for many. At this time, Zoom was relatively unknown, but it
offered a robust way to be in touch virtually, and its ease of use, widespread accessibility
and low cost drove its rapid uptake by workers, individuals and businesses.
Eric had developed Zoom to solve his own business problem: his customers would want
him to visit in person to transact important trade deals, but he developed Zoom so he could
answer instead, ‘Let’s have a Zoom call.’ As a result, much of his business has
been done without the expense of costly commuting, he has recruited staff,
and even raised funds for the initial public offering on the NASDAQ New York Stock
Exchange, virtually. Eric wanted Zoom to work equally well in corporate boardrooms as it
would around kitchen tables, so it was built in the cloud and uses freemium pricing so
everyone can host a 40-minute video call with work colleagues, friends, family and even
their pets.
There are many opportunities for firms to reimagine implementation strategies using flexible
working, which appears to be here to stay, as remote working and virtual meetings are now
commonplace. Firms are rethinking how to plan work schedules, and reducing physical
space as fewer workers return to the office. Business travel is also being cut as the need to
travel – especially long distances – is replaced by videoconferencing.
Eric’s vision and implementation strategy for Zoom worked, and the pandemic restrictions
helped too, as sales rose more than 40 per cent in 2021. The pandemic turned remote
working into mainstream business practice and ‘Zooming’ has become a global activity for
the long term.

Management of Change
Change is inevitable in marketing organizations, as they aim to remain relevant
in society, which is constantly shifting and transforming in response to global
events (Elrod II and Tippet 2002). Recently, Brexit has impacted on trading in
the UK, Europe and beyond; Covid-19 affected working practices, supply
chains, workforce, health and well-being; global warming is a constant threat
to the planet as rising CO2
 emissions affect our weather, and firms,
governments and individuals seek ways to live more sustainable lives. For afirm to survive and thrive in turbulent times, it needs to be agile, flexible and
responsive to changing and evolving trading environments (Smith et al. 2012).
Approaches towards managing change
Karasvirta and Teerikangas (2022) argue change is so fundamental to business
success it can become a deliberate and enduring strategy. However,
organizational change does not just happen; it needs to be planned and
managed, as resistance to change can result in negative outcomes and failed
change strategies.
Change may mean different things at different times (e.g. depending on the
speed of the response needed or the scale of organizational transformation).
Change management approaches typically fall into one of two categories:
1. Procedural approaches using a planned method based on Lewin’s (1947)
three-step approach to change, which involves unfreezing the existing
attitude towards change, making the change and then refreezing attitudes
towards new practices. While Lewin’s approach has been widely used by
businesses for many decades, its critics say the approach is too simplistic
and the idea of ‘refreezing’ attitudes is not appropriate in today’s complex
organizational structures (Cummings et al. 2016).
2. Descriptive approaches, which seek to explain determinants of the outcome
of change. For example, McKinsey’s 7-S model proposes a framework for
reviewing seven interrelated elements of an organization: strategy, structure,
systems, staff, style, skills and shared values.
Organizational change management has evolved since Lewin’s work to
provide greater clarity and understanding on the application of planned
change, although the basic principles of the three-step approach remain
pertinent today (Rosenbaum et al. 2018).
A key factor in implementing a change programme is top management
support. Without management’s clear, visible and consistent backing, a major
change programme is likely to falter under the inertia created by vested
interests (Johannessen et al. 1993). It is important for firms to monitor change,
ensuring systems are in place to gather and disseminate information
throughout the organization. For example, Cisco invites key clients to
discussions, workshops and collaboration meetings, using a combination of
face-to-face and technology-driven approaches such as video and Webex cloud
conferencing, to enhance customer relationships. The objectives are to analysepage 841
how the firm can develop to better serve the customers. Cisco’s partnership
approaches not only enable it to gain first-hand knowledge of
customer preferences, but also to ensure that the entire
organization is immediately aware of customers’ experiences and demands,
which helps to build stronger and closer customer relationships (Cisco 2015).
The implementation of a new strategy may have profound effects on
people in organizations. Brand managers who discover that their product is to
receive fewer resources (be harvested) may feel bitter and demoralized; a
salesperson who loses because of a change in the payment system may feel
equally aggrieved. The implementation of a strategy move is usually
associated with the need for people to adapt to change. The cultivation of
change, therefore, is an essential ingredient in effective implementation.
Human response to change
Change affecting us is a constant, and is widely studied in diverse areas
including organizational change, bereavement theory, stress management and
team-building. Following Lewin’s step model approach to change (1947),
Kübler-Ross (1969) wrote about ‘crisis in human life’, looking at death and its
impact on individuals, and found a series of steps an individual goes through in
order to reach a point where they could manage their experiences. Adams and
colleagues (1976) extended this and the work of others into a model of
transition, which people go through at different critical points in their lives
(e.g. changing jobs, getting married or divorced, moving house and
bereavement). Grant (1996) related this transition model to how managers help
others through organizational change. Elrod II and Tippet (2002) found most
workers do not anticipate change and, when it comes, they resist it. This leads
to a series of behaviours, captured in change models, which transition from a
state of normality, through disruptions and back to a new state of normality.
Hidden Gem 21.1 explores flexible working, but it is important to recognize
the transition to remote working was rapid and forced by government
restrictions, and individuals handled the transition in different ways: for some
it opened up opportunities, while for others it was a negative, and led to
deteriorating outcomes and performance in the longer term (Evans et al. 2021).
It is important, then, to understand that the link between management
approaches towards change and the individual worker is that individual
development directly affects organizational development (Rooke and Torbett
1999). Marketing managers therefore need to understand the emotional stagespage 842
individuals pass through when confronted with an adverse change. These
stages are illustrated in the transition curve based on the work of Kübler-Ross
(1969) in Figure 21.3.
FIGURE 21.3
The transition curve

Shock
The first reaction is usually shock. The enormity of the consequences leads to
feelings of being overwhelmed, despair and numbness. The outward symptoms
include silence and lack of overt response. The news that a field sales force is
to be replaced by a telemarketing team is likely to provoke numbness in the
field sales team. More people are likely to experience being replaced as rapid
advances in technology, such as artificial intelligence, robotics and self-service
systems, enable machines to do the work of humans. This means managersmust be more aware of how to manage change and must reassess the changing
skills needed (see Exhibit 21.1).

Denial
Denial and disbelief may follow numbness, leading to trivializing the news,
denying it or joking about it. The aim is to minimize the psychological impact
of the change. News of the abandonment of the field sales force may be met
with utter disbelief and sentiments such as ‘They would never do that to us’ as
individuals look for evidence this is not actually happening. At Nokia,
employees and the firm’s stakeholders didn’t accept its Symbian operation was
to be outsourced to Accenture, with employees’ contracts to be terminated or
transferred to the new company. Many employees walked out and protested at
the changes (Khan et al. 2017).
Frustration
Frustration, anger and even self-doubt occur as the certainty of the change
starts to become a reality. Personal feelings of uncertainty may arise. The
feeling is one of powerlessness, of being out of control – and the situation has
taken over the individual. The likely reaction is one of anger: both as
individuals and as a group, sales force staff are likely to vent their anger and
frustration on management.
Depressionpage 843
As management of the change begins to take effect, individuals can feel
depressed, may lack energy or enthusiasm for work, and may find it difficult to
attend the workplace.
Experimentation
Experimentation, acceptance and adaptation to the new situation is
characterized by tolerating the new reality and letting go of the past. This is
likely to occur at an emotional low point, but it is the beginning of an upward
surge as comfortable attitudes and behaviours are severed and the need to cope
with the change is accepted. In the sales force example, salespeople would
become accustomed to the fact that they will no longer be calling upon certain
customers and receiving a particular salary. As people adapt to the changes,
they become more energized, and begin testing new behaviours and
approaches to life. Alternatives are explored and evaluated. This stage is
fraught with personal risk, and the danger of being let down once more, which
leads to anger and frustration. Salespeople may consider another sales job,
becoming part of the telemarketing team or moving out of selling altogether.
Decision
As people’s emotions become much more positive and they feel they have got
to grips with the change, they seek a clear understanding of the new situation.
Staff from the sales team may have been redeployed in other areas of
marketing and so begin to learn how to work in the new situation.
Integration
The final stage is where feelings reach a new high. The change is fully
accepted, adaptation is complete and behaviour alters too. Sometimes this is
reflected in statements such as ‘That was the best thing that could have
happened to me.’ People can gain a sense of renewal, new direction in
workplace roles and new opportunities to contribute to the firm’s success.
ImplicationsMost people pass through all of the above stages, although the movement from
one stage to the next is rarely smooth. The implication for managing marketing
implementation is that acceptance of fundamental change, such as the
reprioritizing of products or jobs, or restructuring of strategic business units,
will take time for people to accept. The venting of anger and frustration is a
behaviour that accompanies this transition from old to new, and should be
accepted as such.

and about senior management involvement in the process at Nokia.

A senior management team should provide leadership and ensure that a firm provides
goods and services in accordance with market demand. As the pace of change increases
and competition intensifies, companies must become more agile and their senior
management teams more responsive. So why do market leaders fail? For example, Nokia
dominated the mobile phone market but lost out to its competitors, Apple and Samsung, in
the handset market as it was not prepared for change.
Entrenched management processes: Budgeting, planning, performance reviews and
succession planning – the processes that drive a business – are often not adapted in
line with new trading environments and conditions. Sometimes, these processes are so
deeply engrained in the firm that they are rarely challenged. So firms should regularly
review their processes and be prepared to change what no longer adds value.page 844
Failure to monitor the competition: As markets change and develop, the key success
factors on which firms compete can change rapidly too, particularly for those companies
operating in high-tech markets. For example, Nokia was not benchmarking carefully
enough against competitors like Apple. Nokia’s problems were not due to lack of
technological invention, as it had a smartphone prototype, or because it hadn’t
recognized the changing market. Instead it failed to successfully implement changes
and did not make decisive, timely decisions – which ultimately meant it was not able to
compete effectively in the emerging smartphone market.
Lack of management diversity: Senior management teams that have been successful
over time tend to become homogeneous – that is, made up of people with similar
worldviews. Consequently, there is a propensity for events, opportunities and
marketplace changes to be missed. This was an issue for Nokia, as its top executives
were all very similar in outlook, age and culture. In contrast, successful technology firm
Infosys proactively sought to avoid this situation by implementing the Voice of Youth
programme, which gave under-30s an opportunity to influence senior management
decisions.
Intolerance of failure: Large companies can become risk-averse, as they perceive that
there is more to lose if they make mistakes. Therefore, it is important to ensure there is
an innovative culture that tolerates failure if a firm is to remain vital. Google, Amazon
and Netflix all actively encourage an entrepreneurial and innovative culture.
In the mobile phone handset market, Nokia has paid a heavy price, as the brand largely
disappeared when it became Microsoft Mobile in April 2015. Microsoft also took over
Nokia’s social media presence, as the new owner did not want any confusion over the
positioning of the new brand. So, will those who remain on Nokia’s team – satellite telecoms
networks – have to watch the gradual disappearance of what was once an innovative
market leader and iconic brand?
The answer is no. Nokia has been transformed; the firm now focuses on creating the
infrastructure and networks that are the foundation of the connected world. For example,
Nokia’s enterprise cloud and integrated solutions for IoT and smart cities are bringing
innovations into the urban landscape.
In 2021, Nokia entered a new phase of organizational change, to enable the firm to better
meet customer needs. The change involved four new business groups focused around its
mobile IP and cloud networks and other Nokia technologies. This was a result of responding
to significant changes in the marketing environment of the technology industry. A strategic
shift in emphasis is placing the customer experience at the centre of all of the firm’s
activities.

Objectives of Marketing ImplementationThe overriding objective of marketing implementation and change, from a
strategic standpoint, is the successful execution of the marketing plan. This
may include:
gaining the support of key decision-makers in the firm for the proposed plan
(and overcoming the opposition of others)
gaining the required resources (e.g. people and money) to be able to
implement the plan
gaining the commitment of individuals and departments in the firm who are
involved in frontline implementation (e.g. marketing, sales, service and
distribution staff)
gaining the cooperation of other departments needed to implement the plan
(e.g. production, and research and development).
For some people, the objectives and execution of the plan are consistent
with their objectives, interests and viewpoints; gaining support from them is
easy. But there are likely to be others who are involved with implementation
who are less willing to support the planned change. They are the losers and
neutrals. Loss may be in the form of lower status, a harder life or a reduction in
salary. Neutrals may be left untouched overall, with gains being balanced by
losses. For some losers, support will never be forthcoming; others may be
responsive to persuasion, whereas neutrals may be more willing to support
change.
The ladder of support
What does support mean? Figure 21.4 illustrates the degree of support that
may be achieved; this can range from outright opposition to full commitment.
FIGURE 21.4
The ladder of supportOpposition
The stance of direct opposition is taken by those with much to lose from the
implementation of the marketing strategy and who believe they have the
political strength to stop the proposed change. Opposition is overt, direct and
forceful.
Resistance
With resistance, opposition is less overt and may take a more passive form
such as delaying tactics. Perhaps because of the lack of a strong power base,
people are not willing to display open hostility but, nevertheless, their
intention is to hamper the implementation process.
Compliance
Compliance means people act in accordance with the plan but without much
enthusiasm or zest. They yield to the need to conform but lack conviction thatpage 845
the plan is the best way to proceed. These reservations limit the lengths to
which they are prepared to go to achieve the successful implementation of the
plan. Staff feel valued when included in key organizational practices/activities.
Acceptance
A higher level of support is achieved when people accept the worth of the plan
and actively seek to realize its goals. However, their minds may be won, but
their hearts are not set on fire, limiting the extent of their motivation.
Commitment
Commitment is the goal of an effective implementation programme. People
not only accept the worth of the plan but also pledge themselves to secure its
success. Both hearts and minds are won, leading to strong conviction,
enthusiasm and zeal. This can be encouraged by making people feel valued.
From Toyota to B&Q, a market-leading DIY chain in the UK, companies are
using members of staff in their advertising campaigns. Pizza Hut used
YouTube for an open casting call to find eight employees to feature in its ad
campaigns. In this way, it was able to involve many hundreds of employees. Its
chief marketing officer said, ‘There is no better way to express the emotional
side of the brand than through the employees that actually deliver the brand
experience every day’ (Bruno 2010). The trend for using employees in
commercials has grown and is used by many brands (see Exhibit 21.2).

Value Creation and Implications for
Marketing Implementation
Increasingly, marketing managers need to be adept at managing the internal
environment of the firm as well as the external. Furthermore, making a
transition from a basic product offer to a value-based offer – which is
increasingly the norm – gives rise to many challenges (Matthyssens and
Vandenbempt 2008). We examine implementation of the marketing concept
(discussed in Chapter 1) from a value-based perspective.
Making the shift and implementing value-based approaches requires firms
to make a significant transition. The marketing concept states that business
success will result from creating greater customer satisfaction than does the
competition. In today’s markets, value co-creation is fundamental to
businesses that want to move forwards from just offering a basic core product
towards achieving a superior market position with a highly differentiated offer.
Figure 21.5 shows the drivers and effects of moving from commoditized
product offers to superior value-based solutions. Each element will be
explained in relation to implementation.
FIGURE 21.5
Model of superior value creationpage 846
Source: based on Matthyssens and Vandenbempt (2008)
Commoditization
Maximizing returns for a firm’s stakeholders is a necessary but no longer a
sufficient condition for creating superior economic performance (Barney
2002). Marketing managers are increasingly put under pressure by the
commoditization of their products and services due to intense global rivalry,
shortening product lifecycles, and increased transparency of pricing and
products. Commoditization occurs when differentiated products lose their
uniqueness and no longer stand out in the marketplace. For marketers, this is a
significant issue and highlights the need for customized solutions that add
value and ensure sustainable competitive advantage.
Profit squeeze
Commoditization can put pressure on firms wanting to provide highly
differentiated offers and can lead to a squeeze on profits. Gillette’s introduction
of its Mach3 multi-blade razor enabled it to stand out from competitors’ single￾blade offer, but they were quick to follow its lead. Sales growth and profits
were squeezed due to the price drops needed to maintain market share. The
value of being in a commoditized market falls away and only the lowest-cost
operators in the market survive as the emphasis is placed on efficiencies rather
than effectiveness. For survival and growth, it becomes crucial for firms to
understand how customer value is changing in each market (Boudier et al.2015). Marketing managers should watch for signs of commoditization – for
example increasing price sensitivity from customers, competitors frequently
cutting prices and/or consolidation occurring across the industry – as firms
look to maintain competitive advantage through increased scale, expanded
reach and improved capability.
Co-creation of value
To deal with commoditization and falling profits, market-orientated firms
should find ways to restore differentiation by increasing the value proposition.
They should be aware, though, that customers may see price reductions as a
desirable benefit and therefore enjoy the effects of increased commoditization.
However, firms are unlikely to survive in the longer term under such
conditions – and, if they fail, everyone potentially loses. So customers need to
understand the benefits of a value-based solution. Implementation of a value￾creation strategy should seek to inform and engage stakeholders across the
value chain. Matthyssens (2019) suggests that this can be achieved by
designing transition paths to guide a firm towards superior value creation as
this has become a way of outperforming competitors and creating superior
value.
This involves overcoming barriers such as antagonistic relationships based
on resisting change and personal ambitions, which can hinder the progress of
marketing in an organization. Another force blocking implementation can be
the gap between what senior managers say and what they do. Webster (1988)
suggests that senior management must give clear signals and establish clear
values and beliefs about serving the customer. However, Argyris (1966) found
senior executives’ behaviour often conflicted with what they said. For
example, they might say ‘Be customer orientated’ and then cut back on
marketing research funds, which results in staff not really believing
management is serious about achieving a customer focus. Matthyssens and
Vandenbempt (2008) argue for carefully planned, incremental steps towards
co-creation of value, enabling internal and external stakeholders to contribute
to the implementation. Matthyssens (2019) identified three stages to
overcoming internal barriers:
1. initiation – overcoming established strategies and frameworks
2. realization – reimagining activities and relationships, and overcoming
existing partnership relationships and lack of required competencies,page 847
encouraging support across activity areas
3. value capturing – overcoming customers’ lack of belief in a firm’s ability to
deliver promised value, establishing the value of a new service in the minds
of the buyers, so they can appreciate the value of the offer, convincing
everyone involved of the importance of the value concept.
Superior value
Value-adding strategies will, to a certain extent, be dependent on the industry
and its critical success factors. Strategies might include: augmenting services
to provide increased customization, which delivers stronger ties with
customers; innovations in products, process and or services, which seek to
make the competition irrelevant; identifying specialist niches and following a
market focus strategy; and innovations in service delivery. Implementing one
or a combination of these generic value-adding strategies can lead to the
creation of superior value (Matthyssens and Vandenbempt 2008) (see Figure
21.5).
Developing Implementation Strategies
Faced with the likelihood of resistance from vested interests, a change master
should develop an implementation strategy that can deliver the required
change (Kanter 1997). For example, when Anne Mulcahy was CEO at Xerox,
the firm was in trouble and she had to act as a change master. She began by
talking to customers and employees to gain an understanding of what was
wrong. She ran meetings differently, forcing people to face the tough
decisions that were necessary, and used the severity of the crisis at
Xerox to gain acceptance for the required changes, which included cutting $1
billion of overheads and closing unprofitable businesses (London and Hill
2002). The workforce was cut by almost 40 per cent, while gaps in Xerox’s
product portfolio were filled with lower-priced products. This gave the firm its
largest product portfolio and made it more competitive. Mulcahy was
succeeded in 2009 by Ursula Burns, who was instrumental in pulling Xerox
back from the brink of bankruptcy (Forbes 2018). Read Mini Case 21.1 to find

Before becoming head of HR at MouthShut.com, inspired by her aunt who had tackled work
with ‘elegance and confidence’ – qualities admired by Zaitun – she developed personal
skills that she honed alongside the knowledge gained while pursuing a law degree at
university, to become a strong resilient leader.
As director of HR at MouthShut.com, Zaitun quickly became aware of the challenges
required to provide radical and innovative solutions to help the business grow. When she
joined the firm she was given the responsibility of managing the HR function single￾handedly. While this was very challenging, it gave her the opportunity to learn about roles
within the firm and that is how she developed a very important understanding of every area
of the business. With this knowledge, she was also able to form new team structures and
improve internal communications and performance. Because of her in-depth knowledge of
the internal workings of the firm she was able to work on ways to inspire staff to form the
new departments, teams and networks needed for the business to succeed.
Zaitun believes in supporting employees through change and helping them to develop a
productive approach that will lead to business improvements. In return, she expects
employees to share and demonstrate their own passion and commitment to their roles. Shepage 848
is a very strong team player, and her personal skills were much in demand as she directed
staff towards changing their working practices to deliver a reliable and trustworthy service.
She describes herself as a ‘compassionate and optimistic’ leader but also recognizes that
effective leadership involves decisive and informed decision-making.
Zaitun also contributed to the strategic direction of the business, stressing the importance of
innovation and research and development as means of securing a sustainable competitive
advantage over competitors like Trustpilot, Sitejabber and Trustvocate.
Questions:
1. Explain how Zaitun might overcome resistance to change in team structures at
MouthShut.com.
2. Identify Zaitun’s leadership qualities, and suggest how these helped her to gain trust
and commitment from employees going through structural changes at the firm.

A change master is a person who is responsible for driving through change
within an organization. This necessitates a structure for thinking about the
problems to be tackled and the way to deal with them. Figure 21.6 illustrates
such a framework. The process starts with the definition of objectives.
FIGURE 21.6
Managing implementation
Implementation objectives
These are formulated at two levels: what we would like to achieve (would-like
objectives) and what we must achieve (must-have objectives). Framingobjectives in this way recognizes that we may not be able to achieve all that
we desire. Would-like objectives are our preferred solution; they define the
maximum that the implementer can reasonably expect (Kennedy et al. 1987).
Must-have objectives define our minimum requirements; if we cannot achieve
these, then we have lost, and the plan or strategy will not succeed. Between the
two points there is an area for negotiation, but beyond our must-have objective
there is no room for compromise.
By clearly defining objectives at the start, we know what we would like,
the scope for bargaining and the point where we have to be firm and resist
further concessions. For example, suppose our marketing plan calls for a move
from a salary-only payment system for salespeople to salary plus commission.
This is predicted to lead to strong resistance from salespeople and some sales
managers who favour the security element of a fixed salary. Our would-like
objective might be a 60:40 split between salary and commission. This would
define our starting point in attempting to get this change implemented. But to
give room for allowances, our must-have objective would be somewhat lower,
perhaps an 80:20 ratio between salary and commission. Beyond this point we
refuse to bargain: we either win or lose on the issue. In some situations,
however, would-like and must-have objectives coincide; here there is no room
for negotiation, and persuasive and political skills are needed to drive through
the issue.
Managing Resistance to Marketing
Implementation
Opposition to the acceptance of marketing and the implementation of
marketing plans is direct, open and conflict driven. Often, arguments such as
the lack of tangible benefits and the extra expense of marketing proposals will
be used to cast doubt on their worth. Equally likely, however, is the more
passive type of resistance. Kanter (1997) and Piercy (2008) suggest 10 forms
of resistance:
1. Criticism of specific details of the plan
2. Foot-dragging
3. Slow response to requestspage 849
4. Unavailability
5. Suggestions that, despite the merits of the plan, resources should be
channelled elsewhere
6. Arguments that the proposals are too ambitious
7. Hassle and aggravation created to wear the proposer down
8. Attempts to delay the decision, hoping the proposer will lose interest
9. Attacks on the credibility of the proposer with rumour and innuendo
0. Deflation of any excitement surrounding the plan by pointing out the risks.
Ansoff and McDonnell (1990) argued the level of resistance will depend
on how much the proposed change is likely to disrupt the culture and power
structure of the organization and the speed at which the change is introduced.
The latter point is in line with the previous discussion about how people adapt
to adverse change, requiring time to come to terms with disruptions. The
greatest level of opposition and resistance will come when the proposed
change is implemented quickly and is a threat to the culture and politics of the
organization; the least opposition and resistance will be found when the change
is consonant with the existing culture and political structure and
is introduced over a period. Further, Pettigrew (1985) states
resistance is likely to be low when a firm is faced with a crisis, arguing that a
common perception among people that the organization is threatened with
extinction also acts to overcome inertia against change.
Leaders can play a central role in guiding recipients of change through
what can be a complex and impactful process. By being supportive, aware of
their own views and attitudes, and understanding of the change situation, they
can positively influence the change process and reduce resistance (Walk 2022).
Internal marketing strategy
All worthwhile plans and strategies necessitate substantial human and
organizational change inside firms (Piercy 1990). Successful organizations are
aware of the importance of employees to their long-term goals. At IBM, job
satisfaction is central to its business activities and is based on the
understanding ‘if employees feel great about their job, so do their clients’
(Burrell and Gherson 2018).
Marketing managers, therefore, need a practical mechanism for thinking
through strategies to drive change. One such framework is known as internalmarketing; it is widely seen as a way of achieving employee satisfaction and
better internal exchanges, and as an important element of value creation (Berry
1981; Boukis and Gounaris 2014; Fang et al. 2014). Originally, the idea of
internal marketing was developed within services marketing, where it applied
to the development, training, motivation and retention of employees in
retailing, catering and financial services (Berry 1981; Grönroos 1985;
Gummesson 1987; Mudie 1987). However, the concept can be expanded to
include marketing to all employees, with the aim of achieving successful
marketing implementation. The framework is appealing as it draws an analogy
with external marketing structures such as market segmentation, target
marketing and the marketing mix. The people inside the organization to whom
the plan must be marketed are considered internal customers. We need to gain
the support, commitment and participation of a sufficient number of these to
achieve acceptance and implementation of the plan. For those people where we
fail to do this, we need to minimize the effectiveness of their resistance. They
become, in effect, our competitors in the internal marketplace. Internal
marketing has become an important management strategy for managing
change and overcoming resistance by focusing on various dimensions of the
internal marketplace. Over several decades, the internal marketing literature
has grown (see Figure 21.7). Each dimension shown in this figure represents
an area of extensive research, which Qiu and colleagues (2021) have
summarized.
FIGURE 21.7
Summary of the core dimensions of internal marketingpage 850
Internal market segmentation
As with external marketing, analysis of customers begins with market
segmentation. One obvious method of grouping internal customers is into three
categories:
1. Supporters – those who are likely to gain from the change or are committed
to it.
2. Neutrals – those whose gains and losses are in approximate balance.
3. Opposers – those who are likely to lose from the change or are traditional
opponents.
These three market segments form distinct target groups for which specific
marketing mix programmes can be developed (see Figure 21.8).
FIGURE 21.8Internal marketing
Internal marketing mix programmes
Product is the marketing plan and strategies being proposed, together with the
values, attitudes and actions needed to make the plan successful. Features of
the product may include increased marketing budgets, extra staff, different
ways of handling customers, different pricing, distribution and advertising, and
new product development strategies. The product will reflect our would-like
objectives; however, it may have to be modified slightly to gain acceptance
from our opponents, and hence the need for must-have objectives.
The price element of the marketing mix is what we are asking our internal
customers to pay because of accepting the marketing plan. The price they pay
may be lost resources, lower status, fear of the unknown, harder work and
rejection of their pet projects because of lack of funds. Clearly, price
sensitivity is a key segmentation variable that differentiates supporters,
neutrals and opposers.
Communications is a major element of the internal marketing mix; it
covers the communications media and messages used to influence the attitudes
of key players. A combination of personal (presentations, discussion groups)
and non-personal (the full report, executive summaries) can be used to inform
and persuade. Communication should be two-way: we should listen as well as
inform. We should also be prepared to adapt the product (the plan), if
necessary, in response to our internal customers’ demands. It may be necessary
to fine-tune the language of marketing (e.g. eliminate jargon) to fit thepage 851
corporate culture and background of the key players. Communication
objectives will differ according to the target group, as follows:
Supporters – to reinforce existing positive attitudes and behaviour, mobilize
support from key players (e.g. chief executive).
Neutrals – the use of influence strategies to build up perception of rewards
and downgrade perceived losses; display key supporters and explain the
benefits of joining ‘the team’; negotiate to gain commitment.
Opposers – disarm and discredit; anticipate objections and create
convincing counter-arguments; position opposers as ‘stuck in their
old ways’; bypass by gaining support of political leaders; negotiate to lower
resistance.
Opposition to the proposals may stem from a misunderstanding on the part
of staff of the meaning of marketing. Some people may equate marketing with
advertising and selling rather than the placing of customer satisfaction as
central to corporate success. An objective of communications, therefore, may
be to clarify the real meaning of marketing or to use terms that are more
readily acceptable, such as ‘improving service quality’ (Laing and McKee
2001).
Distribution describes the places where the product and communications
are delivered to the internal customers, such as meetings, committees,
seminars, informal conversations and away days. Consideration should be
given to whether presentations should be direct (from proponents to
customers) or indirect (using third parties such as consultants). Given the
conflicting viewpoints of the three target segments, thought should be given to
the advisability of using different distribution channels for each group. For
example, a meeting may be arranged with only supporters and neutrals present.
If opponents tend to be found in a particular department, judicious selection of
which departments to invite may accomplish this aim.
Execution
To execute an implementation strategy successfully, certain skills are required
and particular tactics need to be employed. Internal marketing has provided a
framework to structure thinking about implementation strategies. Within that
framework, the main skills are persuasion, negotiation and politics.
PersuasionThe starting point of persuasion is to try to understand the situation from the
internal customer’s standpoint. The new plan may have high profit potential,
the chance of real sales growth and be popular among external customers, but
if it is perceived to cause grief to individuals and/or internal departments,
resistance is likely to occur. As with personal selling, the proponents of the
plan must understand the needs, motivations and problems of their customers
before they can hope to develop effective messages. For example, appealing to
a production manager’s sense of customer welfare will fail if that person is
interested only in smooth production runs. In such a situation, the proponent of
the plan needs to show how smooth production will not be affected by the new
proposals, or how disruption will be marginal or temporary.
The implementer also needs to understand how the features of the plan
(e.g. new payment structure) confer customer benefits (e.g. the opportunity to
earn more money). Whenever possible, evidence should be provided to support
claims. Objectives should be anticipated and convincing counter-arguments
produced. Care should be taken not to bruise egos unnecessarily.
Negotiation
Implementers have to recognize that they may not get all they want during this
process. By setting would-like and must-have objectives (as discussed above),
negotiators are clear about what they want and have given themselves
negotiating room wherever possible.
Two key aspects of negotiation will be considered next: concession
analysis and proposal analysis.
The key to concession analysis is to value the concessions the
implementer might be prepared to make from the viewpoint of the opponent.
By doing this, it may be possible to identify concessions that cost the
implementer very little and yet are highly valued by the opponent. For
example, if the must-have objective is to move from a fixed salary to a salary
plus commission, a salesperson’s compensation plan which concedes that the
proportions should be 80:20 rather than 70:30 may be trivial to the
implementer (an incentive to sell is still there) and yet highly valued by the
salesperson, as they will gain more income security and value the
psychological bonus of winning a concession from management. By trading
concessions that are highly valued by the opponent and yet cost the
implementer little, agreement can be reached painlessly.page 852
Proposal analysis is another sensible activity, which tries to predict the
proposals and demands opponents are likely to make during the process of
implementation. This provides time to prepare a response rather than rely on
quick decisions during the heat of negotiations. By anticipating the kinds of
proposals opponents are likely to make, implementers can plan the types of
counter-proposal they are prepared to make.
Politics
Success in managing implementation and change also depends on the
understanding and execution of political skills. Understanding the sources of
power is the starting point from which an assessment of where power lies, and
who holds the balance, can be made. The five sources of power suggested by
French and Raven (1959) are reward, expert, referent, legitimate and coercive
power.
Reward power derives from the implementer’s ability to provide benefits
to members in the organization. The recommendations of the plan may confer
natural benefits in the form of increased status or salary for some people. In
other cases, the implementer may create rewards for support, for example
promises of reciprocal support when required, or backing for promotion. The
implementer needs to assess what each target individual values, and whether
the natural rewards match those values or whether created rewards are
necessary. A limit on the use of reward power is the danger that people may
come to expect rewards in return for support. Created rewards, therefore,
should be used sparingly.
Expert power is based on the belief that implementers have special
knowledge and expertise that renders their proposals more credible. For
example, a plan outlining major change is more likely to be accepted if
produced by someone who has a history of success rather than by a novice.
Implementers should not be reluctant to display their credentials as part of the
change process.
Referent power occurs when people identify with and respect the architect
of change. That is why charismatic leadership is often thought to be an
advantage to those who wish to see change implemented.Legitimate power is wielded when the implementer insists on an action
from a subordinate as a result of their hierarchical relationship and contract.
For example, a sales manager may demand compliance with a request for a
salesperson to go on a training course, or a board of directors may exercise its
legitimate right to cut costs.
The strength of coercive power lies with the implementer’s ability to
punish those who resist or oppose the implementation of the plan. Major
organizational change is often accompanied by staff losses. This may be a
required cost-cutting exercise, but it also sends messages to those not directly
affected that they may be next if further change is resisted. The problem with
using coercive power is that, at best, it results in compliance rather than
commitment.
The balance of power will depend on who holds the sources of power and
how well these are applied. Implementers should pause to consider any sources
of power they hold, and the sources and degree of power held by supporters,
neutrals and opposers. Power held by supporters should be mobilized; those
neutrals who wield power should be cultivated; and tactics should be
developed to minimize the influence of powerful opposers. The tactics that can
be deployed will be discussed shortly, but two applications of power will be
discussed first: overt and covert power plays.
Overt power plays are the visible, open kind of power plays that can be
used by implementers to push through their proposals. Unconcealed use of the
five sources of power is employed to influence key players. The use of overt
power by localized interests who battle to secure their own interests in the
process of change has been well documented (see Hickson et al. 1971; Hinings
et al. 1974).
Covert power plays are a more disguised form of influence. Their use is
more subtle and devious than that of overt power plays. Their application can
take many forms, including agenda-setting, limiting participation in decisions
to a few select individuals/departments, and defining what is and is not open to
decision for others in the organization (Wilson 1992).
Tactics
The discussion of overt and covert power plays has introduced some of the
means by which implementers and change agents can gain acceptance of their
proposals and overcome opposition. Now we examine in more detail thepage 853
tactics and skills needed to win implementation battles and how they can be
applied in the face of some hostile reaction within the organization. These can
be grouped into tactics of persuasion, politics, time and negotiation (see Figure
21.9), and are based on the work of a number of authorities (Kanter
1983; Ansoff and McDonnell 1990; Kanter et al. 1992; Piercy 2008).
The tactics provide a wide-ranging checklist of approaches to mobilizing
support and overcoming resistance.
FIGURE 21.9
Tactics for implementing marketing plans
Persuasion
Articulate a shared vision: The vision of where the organization is heading
and the desired results of the change need to be clearly stated to key players
in the organization. For example, if the marketing plan calls for a reduction
in staffing levels, the vision that this is required to reposition the firm for
greater competitiveness needs to be articulated. Without an understanding of
the wider picture, people may regard the exercise as ‘just another cost drive’
(Kanter et al. 1992). Since most change involves risk and discomfort, a clear
vision of its purpose and consequences can make the risk acceptable and the
discomfort endurable.
Communicate and train: Implementation of the marketing concept or a
fundamentally different marketing plan means that many individualspage 854
reorientate and engage in new activities. To achieve this requires a major
commitment to communicating the nature and purpose of the change, as
well as to training staff in the new skills to be mastered. Major changes
require face-to-face communication at discussion sessions and management
education seminars. Formal training programmes are needed to upgrade
skills and introduce new procedures.
Eliminate misconceptions: A major part of the communication programme
will be designed to eliminate misconceptions about the consequences of the
change. Unfounded fears and anxieties should be allayed. Certain
individuals will exaggerate the negative consequences of the proposed
changes, and their concerns need to be addressed.
Sell the benefits: The needs of key players must be identified and the
benefits of the change sold to them on that basis. The benefits may be
economic (e.g. increased salary) or psychological (e.g. increased status,
enhanced power). Whereas shared vision provides evidence of a wider
general benefit (e.g. increased competitiveness), personal benefits should
also be sold. This recognizes the fact that individuals seek to achieve not
only organizational goals but also personal ambitions.
Gain acceptance by association: Position the plan against some well￾accepted organizational doctrine such as customer service or quality
management. Because the doctrine is heavily backed, the chances of the
plan being accepted and implemented are enhanced. Another positioning
strategy is to associate the plan with a powerful individual (e.g. the chief
executive). The objective is to create the viewpoint that if the boss wants the
plan, there is no point in opposing it.
Leave room for local control over details: Leaving some local options or
local control over details of the plan creates a sense of ownership on the part
of those responsible for implementation and encourages adaptation to
different situations. Thought should be given to the extent of uniformity in
execution and the areas where local adoption is both practical and advisable.
Support words with action: When implementation involves establishing a
more marketing-orientated culture, it is vital to support words with
corresponding action. As we saw when discussing resistance to the
marketing concept, it is easy for managers to contradict their
words with inappropriate actions (e.g. stressing the need to
understand customers and then cutting the marketing research budget). An
illustrative case of how management actions supported the culture that
management were trying to create is the story of a regional manager at USfirm United Parcel Service (UPS), who used his initiative to untangle a
misdirected shipment of Christmas presents by hiring an entire train and
diverting two UPS-owned 727s from their flight plans (Bonoma 1984).
Despite the enormous cost (which far exceeded the value of the business),
when senior management learned what he had done they praised and
rewarded him – his actions supported and reinforced the culture they wanted
to foster. As this story became folklore at UPS, its staff knew that senior
management meant business when they said that the customer had to come
first.
Establish two-way communication: It is important that the people who are
responsible for implementation feel that they can put their viewpoints to
senior management, otherwise the feeling of top-down control will spread,
and resistance will build up through the belief that ‘no one ever listens to
us’. It is usually well worth listening to people lower down the management
hierarchy and especially those who come face to face with customers. One
way of implementing this approach is through staff suggestion schemes, but
these need to be managed so that staff believe it is worth the bother of taking
part.
Asda, the UK supermarket, is well known for its policy of tapping into the
collective wisdom of its 85,000 staff. It encourages them to put forward
suggestions for improved customer service, and the best ideas are presented at
an annual meeting called the National Circle. It also invites staff to write
directly to its chief executive officer, with the most promising ideas being
rewarded with ‘star points’ that staff can redeem against a catalogue of offers
including clothes and holidays.

Unilever Creates Virtual Jams While Chatting With Its
Employees
Unilever has more than 400 brands, 170,000 employees and is number one in fast-moving
consumer goods markets in 26 countries, so managing internal communications creates
many challenges. However, to ensure it can maintain its record of excellent customer
service and high product quality, the firm is always looking at innovative ways to interactpage 855
with its customers and employees around the globe. More specifically, in 2013, it looked for
ways to bring internal teams together more effectively, improve morale, and inspire and
motivate personal and professional development.
Source: PSL Images/Alamy Stock Photo
The solution was a ‘virtual jam lobby’ – a virtual conference that enabled employees working
across the globe to communicate and take part in a scheduled event using a digital
communications hub. The event created an opportunity to share live content, cut the costs
of employees having to travel to a single location, enabled multiple collaborations and
delivered very effective internal communications.
Unilever constantly finds ways to involve its large workforce in the running of its many
businesses. Using innovative technology platforms to enable the sharing of ideas, solutions
to problems and personal opinions produces rich feedback from employees.
Based on: McDonagh (2014); Unilever (2018)
Politics
Build coalitions: The process of creating allies for the proposed measures is
a crucial step in the implementation process. Two groups have special
significance: power sources that control the resources needed for
implementation – such as information (expertise or data) and finance and
support (legitimacy, opinion leadership and political backing) – and
stakeholders, who are those people likely to gain or lose from the change
(Kanter et al. 1992). Discussion with potential losers may reveal ways of
sharing some rewards with them (‘invite the opposition in’). At the
very least, talking to them will reveal their grievances and so allow
thought to be given as to how these may be handled. Another product of
these discussions with both potential allies and foes is that the original
proposals may be improved by accepting some of their suggestions.Display support: Having recruited powerful allies, these should be asked for
a visible demonstration of support. This will confirm any statements that
implementers have made about the strength of allies’ backing (‘gain
acceptance by association’). Allies should be invited to meetings,
presentations and seminars so that stakeholders can see the forces behind the
change.
Invite the opposition in: Thought should be given to creating ways of
sharing the rewards of the change with the opposition. This may mean
modifying the plan and how it is to be implemented to take account of the
needs of key players. As long as the main objectives of the plan remain
intact, this may be a necessary step towards removing some opposition.
Warn the opposition: Critics of the plan should be left in no doubt as to the
adverse consequences of opposition. This has been called selling the
negatives. However, the tactic should be used with care, because statements
that are perceived as threats may stiffen rather than dilute resistance,
particularly when the source does not have a strong power base.
Use of language: In the political arena, the potency of language in endorsing
a preferred action and discrediting the opposition has long been apparent.
Language can be used effectively in the implementation battle. For example,
critics of the new plan may be being labelled ‘outdated’, ‘backward looking’
and ‘set in their ways’. In meetings, implementers need to avoid the
temptation to overpower in their use of language. For people without a
strong power base (such as young newcomers to a firm), using phrases like
‘We must take this action’ or ‘This is the way we have to move’ to people in
a more senior position (e.g. a board of directors) will provoke psychological
resistance, even to praiseworthy plans. Phrases like ‘I suggest’ or ‘I have a
proposal for you to consider’ recognize the inevitable desire on the part of
more senior management to feel involved in the decision-making rather than
being treated like a rubber stamp.
Decision control: This may be achieved by agenda-setting (i.e. controlling
what is and is not discussed in meetings), limiting participation in decision￾making to a small number of allies, controlling which decisions are open for
debate in the organization, and timing important meetings when it is known
that a key critic is absent (e.g. on holiday or abroad on business).
The either/or alternative: Finally, when an implementation proposal is
floundering, a powerful proponent may decide to use the either/or tactic in
which the key decision-maker is required to choose between two documentsplaced on the desk: one asks for approval of the implementation plan; the
other tenders the implementer’s resignation.
Time
Incremental steps: People need time to adjust to change; therefore
consideration should be given to how quickly change is introduced. Where
resistance to the full implementation package is likely to be strong, one
option is to submit the strategy in incremental steps. A small, less
controversial strategy is implemented first, then its success provides the
impetus for the next implementation proposal, and so on.
Persistence: This tactic requires the resubmission of the strategy until it is
accepted. Modifications to the strategy may be necessary on the way, but the
objective is to wear down the opposition by resolute and persistent force.
Implementation can be a battle of wills and requires the capability of the
implementer to accept rejection without loss of motivation.
Leave insufficient time for alternatives: A different way of using time is to
present plans at the last possible minute so there is insufficient time for
anyone to present or implement an alternative. The proposition is basically,
‘We must move with this plan as there is no alternative.’
Wait for the opposition to leave: For those prepared to play a waiting game,
withdrawing proposals until a key opposition member leaves the firm or
loses power may be feasible. Implementers should be alert to changes in the
power structure in these ways as they may present a window of opportunity
to resubmit hitherto rejected proposals.
Negotiation
Make the opening stance high: When the implementer suspects that a
proposal in the plan is likely to require negotiation, the correct opening
stance is to start high but be realistic. There are two strong reasons for this:
first, the opponent may accept the proposal without modification; second, it
provides room for negotiation. When deciding how high to go, the limiting
factor is the need to avoid unnecessary conflict. For example, asking for a
move from a fixed salary to a commission-only system with a view to
compromising with salary plus commission is likely to be unrealistic and to
provoke unnecessary antagonism among the sales force.Trade concessions: Sometimes it may be possible to grant a page 856
concession simply to secure agreement to the basics of the plan.
Indeed, if the implementer has created negotiating room, this may be
perfectly acceptable. In other circumstances, however, the implementer may
be able to trade concession for concession with the opponent. For example,
a demand from the sales force to reduce list price may be met by a counter￾proposal to reduce discount levels. A useful way of trading concessions is by
means of the if… then technique: ‘If you are prepared to reduce your
discount levels from 10 to 5 per cent, I am then prepared to reduce list price
by 5 per cent’ (Kennedy et al. 1987). This is a valuable tool in negotiation,
because it promotes movement towards agreement and yet ensures that
concessions given to the opponent are matched by concessions in return.
Whenever possible, an attempt to create win–win situations should be made
in which concessions that cost the giver very little are valued highly by the
receiver.
Evaluation
Finally, during and after the implementation process, evaluation should be
made to consider what has been achieved and what has been learned.
Evaluation may be in terms of the degree of support gained from key players,
how well the plan and strategy have been implemented in the marketplace (e.g.
using customer surveys), the residual goodwill between opposing factions, and
any changes in the balance of power between the implementers and other key
parties in the firm.
Marketing Organization
The marketing organization provides the context in which marketing
implementation occurs. There are various organizational structures: functional,
product-based or market-centred matrix.
Not all firms have a marketing department – small companies cannot
afford the luxury of managerial specialism, and some financially or
production-driven organizations do not see the value of having one. In small
firms, the owner-manager may carry out some of the functions of marketing,page 857
such as developing customer relationships and product development. This
changes as firms develop and grow.
Functional organization
As firms expand, the importance of various business functions are realized and
a marketing manager could be appointed to oversee the marketing function
within the firm (see Figure 21.10). Care should be taken when
organizing marketing structures – especially in newly developing
firms – as there can be tension between business departments. For example,
sources of friction between sales and marketing can be:
Economic – such as wrangles over budget allocations. For example, the
sales force tends to blame marketers for the way they spend money on
promotions, and the marketers look to the sales force to achieve the highest
possible prices; friction is rife between the two groups.
Cultural – the two job roles attract different types of individual; marketers
tend to be analytical and project focused, whereas salespeople are skilled
relationship builders and have an acute insight into which products will sell
(Kotler et al. 2006).

Functionalisms bring the benefit of task specialization and a clear
definition of the responsibilities of a marketing organization (Workman et al.
1998).
Marketing organization and implementation are inevitably intertwined, as
the former affects the day-to-day activities of marketing managers. It is
important that we understand the organizational world as marketing managers
have come to understand it, in particular, the activities that constitute their job
(Brownlie and Saren 1997).
As the marketing environment changes, organizational structures evolve,
and the growing importance of digital marketing has impacted on the
functional structures within many marketing departments as has the focus of
the activities under the direct control of the marketing director (see Figure
21.10), for example.
Product-based organization
The need to give sufficient care and attention to individual products has led
many companies (particularly in the fast-moving consumer goods field) to
move to a product-based structure. For example, Unilever has moved from apage 858
functional to a product management system. A common structure is for a
product manager to oversee a group of brands within a product field supported
by brand managers who manage specific brands (see Figure 21.11). The
product manager’s role is to coordinate the business management of their
brands. At Unilever, its divisions are organized around its products (e.g.
personal care, foods, homecare and refreshments), and each division is able to
manage development, manufacturing, distributions, sales and marketing. This
structure enables each division to take control and contribute to the
organization’s business strategy, which centres on differentiation and building
competitive advantage (Young 2018). Alongside the product divisions are
finance, legal and marketing communication divisions, which support each of
the product areas and geography-based structures, which concentrate on North
America, Europe and other parts of the world. Adding geographical structures
helps large international firms like Unilever to organize their businesses
around regions, and benefit from local market networks and cultural
knowledge.

Matrix organization and ecosystems
For firms with a wide product range selling in diverse markets, a matrix
structure may be necessary to enable a multiple command system, which
relates to products and organizational functions (Gos 2015), shares managerial
power across two dimensions (vertical and horizontal), and thus facilitates
cutting across functional divisions and overcomes traditional restrictive
hierarchical structures (McPhail 2016).
The organizational structure resembles a grid (an example is shown in
Figure 21.12) and functional dimensions are overlaid so individuals from
different areas of the firm can work with specific project teams.
Matrix concepts became popular in the 1990s, in major aerospace
and defence projects, but their success encouraged many innovative firms in
different industries to implement a matrix-management structure. Matrix
structures offer key advantages:
managing complexity and enabling greater coordination
effective communications
resource efficiency and quality outputs
high motivation and job satisfaction
decision-making effectiveness
balanced power structures.
FIGURE 21.12
Matrix organizationSource: based on: Whitford (2006); Gos (2015)
Conflict and stress are negative characteristics of this type of
organizational structure (Gos 2015; McPhail 2016).
While a matrix structure is popular as it has many benefits, it does not suit
all organizations. P&G, for example, abandoned its three-way matrix structure
in 2019, preferring to operate through six business units based around product
types (e.g. baby and feminine care, grooming, family care, new ventures).
Each unit operates with a CEO who reports to P&G’s CEO (Reuters 2018).
As value creation becomes more central it is important to consider how this
affects organizational structure. An ecosystem involves managing multi-level
operations in a complex network of connected organizations. Global e￾commerce firm Alibaba uses a matrix structure that has been expanded to build
ecosystem matrix structures.
Marketing Control
Marketing control is an essential element of the marketing planning process
because it provides a review of how well marketing objectives have been
achieved. A framework for controlling marketing activities is given in Figure
21.13. The process begins by deciding marketing objectives, leading to thesetting of performance standards. For example, a marketing objective for a
large industrial firm of ‘widening the customer base’ might lead to the setting
of the performance standard of ‘generating 20 new accounts within 12
months’. Similarly, the marketing objective of ‘improving market share’ might
translate into a performance standard of ‘improving market share from 20 per
cent to 25 per cent’.
FIGURE 21.13
The marketing control system
The next step is to locate responsibility. In some cases, responsibility
ultimately falls on one person (e.g. the brand manager); in others it is shared
(e.g. the marketing director, sales manager and sales force). It is important to
consider this issue, since corrective or supportive action may need to focus on
those responsible for the success of marketing activity.
Performance is then evaluated against standards, which relies on an
efficient information system, and a judgement has to be made about the desiredpage 860
degree of success and/or failure achieved, and what corrective or supportive
action is to be taken. This can take various forms:
Failure attributed to poor performance of individuals may result in the
giving of advice regarding future attitudes and actions, training and/or
punishment (e.g. criticism, lower pay, demotion, termination of
employment). Success, on the other hand, should be rewarded through
praise, promotion and/or higher pay.
Failure attributed to unrealistic marketing objectives and
performance standards may cause them to be lowered for the
subsequent period. Success that is thought to reflect unambitious objectives
and standards may cause them to be raised in the next period.
The attainment of marketing objectives and standards may also mean
modification for the next period. For example, if the marketing objective
and performance standard of opening 20 new accounts is achieved, this may
mean that the focus for the next period may change. The next objective may
focus on customer retention, for instance.
The failure of one achieved objective to bring about another may also
require corrective action. For example, if a marketing objective of
increasing calls to new accounts does not result in extra sales, the original
objective may be dropped in favour of another (e.g. improving product
awareness through advertising).
Finally, plans are made for taking corrective or supportive action. If
correction is required, it may mean changing strategy or tactics to achieve set
goals. Extra support may be required to turn things around or to ensure future
development.
Control can occur at different levels in an organization: strategic or
operational.
Strategic and operational control
Strategic control concerns major business issues; assessment and control focus
on firm strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats; and the process of
control is through a marketing audit. In essence, marketing managers are
seeking to ensure the firm can answer the question ‘Are we doing the right
thing?’ There are increasing demands on the marketing function to become
accountable for its activities. Control of strategic issues involves looking at
longer-term objectives and then answering questions like ‘Are we in the rightmarket?’, ‘Are we selling the right products and services?’, ‘Does the firm
have the right resources and capabilities to succeed?’ The answers to these
questions can lead to significant or incremental changes to strategic objectives
and investments across the firm. The marketing audit provides a
comprehensive checklist of internal and external factors for firms to review, to
determine progress and performance. See Chapter 17 for detailed discussion of
how to conduct a marketing audit.
Operational control focuses on short-term tactical areas of a firm’s
activities. An array of measures (often referred to as marketing metrics) are
available to marketing managers who wish to measure the effectiveness of
their activities (Faris et al. 2006).
To be accountable, marketing managers use marketing metrics, which are
quantitative measures of the outcomes of marketing activities and
expenditures. No longer can marketing executives attend budget meetings
expecting to spend more money on advertising, promotion, direct marketing
and other marketing activities without quantitative justification of these
expenditures. Marketing accountability – the requirement to justify
marketing investment by using marketing metrics – is key to ongoing
investment. Without such justification, marketing budgets are often the first to
be cut in an economic downturn. During the Covid-19 pandemic, advertising
spend in Europe was down by around 9 per cent, and online media buyers and
planners paused spending (IAB 2020; World Economic Forum 2020).
Marketing metrics and analytics
Marketers need to measure and be able to demonstrate growth and
performance improvements over time. To do this they need a baseline from
which to measure. For example, at the start of a social media campaign,
awareness will be very low, but as the campaign develops, engagement
increases, customer conversions grow and sales (if applicable) increase, and if
measured accurately it becomes possible to demonstrate the performance of a
campaign.
Figure 21.14 shows key marketing metrics.
FIGURE 21.14
Key marketing metricspage 861
Profit/profitability
Profit is the financial objective of most organizations, so it is the most used
metric. Similarly, profitability, which measures the profit return on investments
such as products or advertising campaigns, is a popular metric since it relates
to the financial objectives of firms. It is usually measured as return on
investment (ROI) and, increasingly, marketers are attempting to measure return
on marketing investment, although accounting for marketing’s contribution to
a sales (and hence profit) increase is sometimes difficult; if possible, a baseline
figure should be established (i.e. what would have happened without
the marketing expenditure). Digital and direct marketing are
increasingly creating opportunities where experiments can be conducted to test
effects when such baseline figures are difficult to establish. Also, ROI is
usually measured over a short time period (e.g. a year), so such calculations
can underestimate the full effects of marketing investments, which, through
brand building, often have positive long-term effects (Ambler and Roberts
2008).
For operational control, profitability analysis can provide useful
information on the profit performance of key aspects of marketing, such as
products, customers or distribution channels.
Processing sales revenue and sales volume is easy, and the metrics are
important determinants of marketing investments. Sales increases are normally
sought to justify higher marketing expenditures, but without corresponding
profit metrics can be misleading. This is because sales can be bought with
excessive discounting, leading to higher sales but lower profits. For thispage 862
reason, rewarding sales forces for higher sales without also measuring profits
can be harmful. (See Chapter 9 for further discussion of pricing strategies.)
Despite these dangers, sales analysis of actual against target sales revenue
can be useful for operational control. Negative variance may be due to lower
sales volume or lower prices. Product, customer and regional analysis will be
carried out to discover where the shortfall arose. A change in the product mix
could account for a sales fall, with more lower-priced products being sold. The
loss of a major customer may also account for a sales decline. Regional
analysis may identify a poorly performing area sales manager or salesperson.
These findings would identify the direction of further investigations to uncover
the reasons for such outcomes.
Gross margin
Gross margin is a popular metric, and different industries and activity sectors
can achieve widely varying gross margins. For example, in retailing, high￾volume, low-price supermarkets achieve low single-digit margins (around 2
per cent), while jewellers typically aim to achieve 45 per cent or more gross
margins because their businesses have lower volume but individual items are
of higher value. Calculated as a percentage, gross margin is an indication of
the percentage of the selling price that is a contribution to profit. It is not
necessarily actual profit, as other expenses such as sales, marketing,
distribution and administrative costs have not been deducted. A problem with
using gross margin as a marketing metric is it can be misleading if these other
expenses are high. The answer is to calculate unit margin, where all costs are
included.
Awareness and digital marketing metrics
Awareness is an important metric because it measures whether a marketing
communications campaign is entering target consumers’ minds. Awareness
measures before and after a campaign are particularly useful. However,
awareness does not necessarily raise purchase levels if the brand is not liked. It
is therefore best used alongside other communications-orientated metrics such
as measures of beliefs, liking, willingness to recommend and purchase
intention. Digital marketing metrics (discussed in detail in Chapter 14) provide
very accurate and detailed results on customer behaviour at all stages of a
campaign and are the means to assessing the contributions of digitalmarketing to business performance (Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick 2022). Table
21.2 shows some typical awareness metrics, while Table 21.3 gives some
examples of digital metrics.

Market share
Market share analysis evaluates a firm’s performance in comparison with
that of its competitors. Sales analysis may show a healthy increase in revenues,
but this may be due to market growth rather than an improved performance
over competitors. An accompanying decline in market share would sound
warning bells regarding relative performance. This would stimulate further
investigation to root out the causes.
Market share decline is not always a symptom of poor performance. This is
why outcomes should always be compared with marketing objectives and
performance standards. If the marketing objective was to harvest a product,
leading to a performance standard of a 5 per cent increase in profits, its
achievement may be accompanied by a market share decline (through the
effect of a price rise). This would be a perfectly satisfactory outcome given thepage 863
desired objective. Conversely, a market share gain may not signal improved
performance if it was brought about by price reductions that reduced profits.
As we saw in Chapter 19, the relative market share metric (percentage)
was used when calculating a brand’s position on the Boston Consulting Group
Matrix. When a brand is a market leader, relative market share has a value
greater than 1. Table 21.4 shows some typical market share metrics.
TABLE 21.4 Some typical market share metrics
Typical metrics Calculation
Market share (value)
Market share (unit)
Relative market share
Number of new products
Innovation is the lifeblood of success, and therefore it is not surprising an
important marketing metric is the number of new products. However, simply
counting the number of new products launched per year does not consider their
success rate. Two other metrics can be used to measure success: the number
(and proportion) of successful launches, where success is recognized when
objectives are achieved; and the proportion of sales revenue (and profits)
attributable to new products (within a given time period). For example, 3M
measures the proportion of sales attributable to new products launched within
six years as a check on their innovative capability.
Care needs to be taken when defining what is a new product. As we saw in
Chapter 19, there are many categories of new product, stretching from brand
extensions to radical innovation (new-to-the-world products).
Therefore, it can be sensible to categorize each of the metrics
according to type of new product. Table 21.5 shows some typical new product
metrics.
TABLE 21.5 Some typical new product metrics
Typical metrics CalculationNumber of new products Number of new products launched per
year
Number of successful new products Number of new products achieving
objectives
Proportion of sales attributable to new products
(PSANP)
Relative price
Table 21.6 shows some typical relative price metrics.
TABLE 21.6 Some typical relative price metrics
Typical metrics Calculation
Ratio of brand A’s price to the average price charged in the
product category (RPAP)
Ratio of brand A’s price to the price of its main competitor
(RPPM)
The relative price metric indicates the extent to which a brand is operating
at a price premium or discount in a product category. A benchmark is required,
which is usually the average price charged or the price of the brand’s main
competitor or the market leader. If brand A was priced at £4 and the average
price charged was £3, the ratio of brand A’s price to the average price charged
in the product category (RPAP) would be 1.33, demonstrating that the brand
was charging a price premium (over the market average) of 33 per cent. If this
metric were supported by market leadership (indicated by using a market share
metric), this would suggest a strong differential advantage for the brand: not
only does the brand outsell its rivals but it does so with a higher price.
Therefore, when used with other metrics, relative price measures can be
indicative of the strength of a brand (brand equity).
Customer dissatisfaction
Table 21.7 shows some typical customer dissatisfaction metrics.page 864
TABLE 21.7 Some typical customer dissatisfaction metrics
Typical metrics Calculation
Number of customer complaints Number of complaints per period
Number of lost customers Number of lost customers per period
Proportion of lost customers (PLC)
Firms measure customer dissatisfaction because it is associated with losing
customers. Monitoring customer complaints helps to assess weaknesses in the
product offering, including service levels. The outcomes of customer
complaints should also be measured, as research has shown that the successful
resolution of a complaint can cause customers to feel more positive about the
firm than before the service failure (Maxham and Netemeyer 2002). The
number and proportion of lost customers are also useful metrics. These can be
measured for consumer packaged goods by consumer panels and for business￾to-business accounts directly from sales data.
Customer satisfaction
Table 21.8 shows some typical customer satisfaction metrics.
TABLE 21.8 Some typical customer satisfaction metrics
Typical metrics Calculation
Satisfaction rating scales Responses to ‘Very dissatisfied’ and to ‘Very satisfied’ rating
scales

expectations
Responses to ‘Worse than expected’ and to ‘Better than
expected’ rating scales

colleague?’ questionpage 865
An increasingly common barometer of marketing success is customer
satisfaction measurement, which is encouraging as customer satisfaction is at
the heart of the marketing concept. Although this measure does not appear
directly on a firm’s profit and loss account, it is a fundamental condition for
corporate success. The process involves setting customer satisfaction criteria,
designing a method of data collection (increasingly by online surveys and
questionnaires) to measure satisfaction on those criteria, choosing which
customers to contact, and analysing and interpreting results.
Big Picture: Key Topics in This
Chapterpage 866 Detailed Review
1. The relationship between marketing strategy, implementation and performance
Appropriate strategy with good implementation will have the best chance of
successful outcomes; appropriate strategy with bad implementation will lead to
trouble, especially if the substandard implementation leads to strategy change;
inappropriate strategy with good implementation may hasten failure or may lead to
actions that correct strategy and therefore produce favourable outcomes; and
inappropriate strategy with bad implementation will lead to failure.
2. The objectives of marketing implementation and change
The overall objective is the successful execution of the marketing plan.
This may require gaining the support of key decision-makers, gaining the required
resources, and gaining the commitment of relevant individuals and departments.
3. The stages that people pass through when they experience disruptive change
The stages are shock, denial, frustration, depression, experimentation, decision
and integration.
4. Objectives of marketing implementation
The ladder of support illustrates key stages in moving from opposition to
commitment, when implementing organizational change.
5. Value-based approaches to deliver the marketing concept
Increased commoditization of products and services is leading to squeezed profits.
Co-creation of value is a way to refocus marketing efforts and approaches towards
creating sustainable superior value.
6. The forms of resistance to marketing implementation and change
The 10 forms of resistance are: criticisms of specific details of the plan; foot￾dragging; slow response to requests; unavailability; suggestions that, despite the
merits of the plan, resources should be channelled elsewhere; arguments that the
proposals are too ambitious; hassle and aggravation created to wear the
proposers down; attempts to delay the decision; attacks on the credibility of the
proposer; and pointing out the risks of the plan.
7. How to develop effective implementation strategies
A change master is needed to drive through change.
Managing the implementation process requires the setting of objectives (‘would
like’ and ‘must have’), strategy (internal marketing), execution (persuasion,
negotiation, politics and tactics) and evaluation (who wins and what can be
learned).
8. The elements of an internal marketing programme
An internal marketing programme mirrors the structures used to market externally,
such as market segmentation, targeting and the marketing mix.page 867
The individuals within the organization are known as internal customers. These
can be segmented into three groups: supporters, neutrals and opposers. These
form distinct target markets that require different internal marketing mixes to be
designed to optimize the chances of successful adoption of the plan.
9. The skills and tactics that can be used to overcome resistance to the
implementation of the marketing concept and plan
The skills are persuasion (the needs, motivations and problems of internal
customers need to be understood before appealing messages can be developed),
negotiation and political skills (the understanding of the sources of power, and the
use of overt and covert power plays).
The tactics are persuasion, politics, timing and negotiation.
10. Marketing organizational structures
The options are: no marketing department, and functional, product￾based, market-centred or matrix organizational structures.
11. The nature of a marketing control system
There are two types of marketing control: strategic and operational control
systems.
Strategic control systems answer the question ‘Are we doing the right things?’ and
are based on a marketing audit.
Operational control systems concern tactical ongoing marketing activities.
Marketing metrics are used for this purpose and to justify marketing investments.
The most commonly used metrics are profit/profitability, sales (value and/or
volume), gross margin, awareness, market share, number of new products,
relative price, customer dissatisfaction, customer satisfaction and
distribution/availability.

Study Questions
1. Think of a situation when you experienced a dramatic change in your life. Using
Figure 21.3 for guidance, recall your feelings over time. How closely did your
experiences match the stages in the figure? How did your feelings at each stage (e.g.
denial and frustration) manifest themselves?
2. Can good implementation substitute for an inappropriate strategy? Give an example
of how good implementation might make the situation worse, and an example of how
it might improve the situation.
3. Discuss commoditization and its potential effects on firm survival.
4. Suggest strategies for the implementation of co-value creation that can lead to
superior value and differentiation.
5. Describe the ways in which people may resist the change that is implied in the
implementation of a new marketing plan. Why should they wish to do this?
6. What is internal marketing? Does the marketing concept apply when planning internal
marketing initiatives?
7. What tactics of persuasion are at the implementer’s disposal? What are the

CASE 41CROCS: BACK WITH MORE
BITE!
The Early Days
Love them or hate them… Crocs are back, and they are undoubtedly here to stay! It has been a
tough road for Crocs, which has been around for nearly 20 years. Crocs made its first
appearance in Boulder, Colorado, US, in 2002, as a producer of boat shoes made from a foam￾based resin known as Croslite (Salo et al. 2021, p.106). The brand enjoyed early success, with
Crocs amassing sales of 75,000 pairs within its first year of operation and 50 million pairs in the
four years that followed. Crocs continued to expand, coupled with rapidly rising sales, and in
2006 bought Jibbitz in a bid to focus on increasing its levels of customization. Jibbitz produces
small plastic charms, which consumers purchase and can then insert into the holes of their
Crocs shoes to personalize their appearance (Moore 2021).
Failed Strategy
The year 2007 saw significant challenges when the brand decided to outsource production in
order to ramp up volumes to meet rising demand. This was met with a notable drop in retail
orders, due to falling foot traffic in malls, leaving the brand stuck with excessive volumes of
inventory. It was also up against a backlash on social media platforms, with younger consumers
regarding Crocs as ‘grandparent shoes’ that were comfortable but ugly. To reduce the ever￾increasing inventory levels, Crocs embarked on a distribution strategy that saw it flood the
market: Crocs were being sold at outlets and towards the end of 2007 were even available at 7-
Eleven. They were available everywhere, which accelerated the counterfeiting of the shoes, as
consumers–especially those in foreign markets–had difficulty distinguishing the original from
the knock-off (Moore 2021). The brand’s image was being tarnished and this was contributing
to its premium appeal being lost. Crocs then found itself affected by the 2007 financial crisis,
with the US economy entering a recession in December that year. Crocs was in the middle of
the ‘perfect storm’ (Weinberg 2009).
The following year was no better: in 2008 Crocs incurred huge losses–in excess of $200
million–causing the closure of 158 stores, retrenching 2,000 employees and seeing its share
price hit rock bottom at $3 a share. Crocs’ woes continued as it broadened its appeal,
expanding the range to include more than 250 different styles of the previously niche-positioned
brand. Crocs’ initial target market remained unchanged, being predominantly baby boomers
and Gen Xers, who were ‘on their feet all day’, as well as nurses, waiters, etc. They simply
adored the orthotic benefits Crocs offered. The brightly coloured, oddly shaped shoes also
proved extremely popular with young children, who loved the cuteness and softness of Crocs.
However, this was not enough to sustain the brand and by the end of 2008 it was at breaking
point (Shivaranjani 2021).
Same Strategy, Same Resultpage 872
In March 2009, Crocs saw the arrival of new CEO John Duerden, a turnaround specialist who
immediately commenced with streamlining the bloated brand. Staff numbers were cut, factories
were closed and excessive inventory shed, with Duerden reverting to the core brand values that
had made Crocs famous around the world. Unprofitable product lines that diversified away from
the Crocs ‘look and feel’, such as premium-priced women’s shoes, were eliminated, with the
brand’s focus shifted to its core brand: the clog. This consolidation strategy proved
successful and in 2010 the brand returned to being profitable, but with this came
the departure of Duerden (De Pillis 2013).

John McCarvel, a loyal Crocs employee who had worked himself up through the ranks, took
over the reins as CEO. He immediately reverted to the diversification strategy that had proved
near fatal for the brand just a few years prior. The next few years saw the brand rapidly expand
its portfolio to include a lightweight sneaker range, flats, heels, sunglasses and everything ‘non￾Croc’, as McCarvel attempted to reposition Crocs as an ‘all season’ brand (MarketLine 2022).
This strategy proved successful, with revenue exceeding $1 billion in 2011.
However, Crocs had clearly not learned from its past mistakes and over the next few years
profits steadily declined (Figure C41.1). In 2015 this once again saw the brand undergo a
streamlining process, closing stores and factories and reducing its product range. The brand
had again lost track of who its customer was.

Note: the all-time high Crocs stock closing price was 180.57 on 12 November 2021; the
average Crocs stock price for the previous 52 weeks is 108.14.
From Ugly Duckling to Swan
In 2015, ugly became the new pretty, and this fashion trend swept across the globe, taking the
Crocs brand along with it and providing the ailing brand with momentum that was sorely
needed. Crocs embraced the ugly fashion trend, and its association with brands like
Christopher Kane, Vivienne Tam and Balenciaga changed the way the brand was perceived, for
ever (Swant 2022). These collaborations were not welcomed by all, but as a brand that had
become accustomed to creating a buzz on social media platforms, Crocs was changing its
strategy.
A shift in the way Crocs segmented its target market brought about a window of opportunity that
allowed it to be daringly creative in the execution of its brand strategies. No longer were its
markets segmented based on demographic factors such as age, gender and income, but rather
the lifestyle factors of the market were used–specifically psychographic factors such as habits,
behaviours and interests. The brand made a conscious effort to shrug off the ‘grandparent
shoe’ stigma, and shifted its attention to being culturally relevant within the context of the ugly
fashion trend (Swant 2022).
Crocs proceeded to direct its marketing strategy towards Generation Z. These young, carefree
individuals, born approximately between the years of 1997 and 2012, who seek individualism
and self-expression, initially seemed like an unlikely fit with the Crocs brand (Francis and
Hoefel 2018). Then came rapper Post Malone, who in 2018 famously tweeted ‘u can tell a lot
about a man by the jibbits on his crocs’, to form a collaboration that would launch Crocs into the
Gen Z market. The collaboration was an overwhelming success, and Crocs further enhanced
its newfound ‘hip and happening’ reputation by also collaborating with influencers such as
Justin Bieber, Bad Bunny and Vera Bradley. These brand associations resulted in
Crocs now being viewed as a brand that was relevant, funky, rebellious and simply
just cool to wear (Swant 2022)!In 2019, Covid-19 presented a major threat for businesses and supply chains globally. People
the world over were confined to their homes and many companies were simply unable to
withstand the devastating effects on their sales and profits. The ‘new normal’–most people
working from home and the associated changes in consumer lifestyles, with comfortable
clothing predominantly being worn–resulted in Crocs being the only major footwear brand to
enjoy a hefty increase in global sales in 2020 (see Figure C41.1) (Moore 2021).
While the brand might not recapture the dizzying heights its share price enjoyed in 2021, it
continues to perform well. The 2021 launch of the Classic Sandal style has increased sandal
sales by 30 per cent and the brand is hoping to top sales of $5 billion by 2026 (Sidell 2022).
Additionally, the launch of the exciting new 2022 ‘Come as You Are’ campaign, supported by a
fresh and well thought out brand positioning strategy, catapulted Crocs back to the top, where it
is enjoying a strong foothold in the footwear market.
Questions
1. This case study highlights Crocs’ implementation of various marketing strategies. Within the
context of Bonoma’s (1985) strategy implementation matrix, and with specific reference to
the ‘Success’ and ‘Failure’ quadrants, outline the factors that could have contributed to
Crocs’ initial failures and subsequent successes.
2. Evaluate Crocs’ approach to managing change within its environment.
3. Provide Crocs with recommendations as to how it could continue to differentiate itself by
increasing its value proposition to its customers.
This case study was written by Terence W. Hermanus, Senior Lecturer, Cape Peninsula
