Preface
This book addresses the prediction and control of noise and vibration in 
ventilation systems and their psychoacoustic effects on people. The content 
is based on past research and lecture material of the authors on acoustics. 
This book is not purported to be a comprehensive book on noise and vibra￾tion control for ventilation systems, because there are several handbooks 
or practical guides for noise and vibration control for ventilation systems. 
Instead, this book provides insights into the development of prediction 
methods and control of noise and vibration from ventilation systems, and 
an assessment of their psychological effects on people.
Summarising all the noise and vibration problems in ventilation systems 
in one book is a daunting and impossible task. In Chapter 1, we have tried 
to provide knowledge of building acoustics and psychoacoustics to readers 
looking for basic knowledge to support their understanding of the rest of 
the book. Chapter 2 briefly introduces duct-borne sound prediction and 
control, as there are design guides and handbooks that provide tables and 
charts for the prediction of transmission noise in air ducts. It also provides a 
stepping stone to the more complicated duct-borne noise problem discussed 
in Chapter 3. Chapter 3 begins by highlighting the engineering importance 
of the prediction of flow-generated noise from ventilation ductwork systems, 
and then introduces past works on the measurement of flow-generated noise 
and the development of prediction techniques for flow-generated noise 
from ventilation systems. Presumably, this is the first reference book to pro￾vide such a detailed review and introduction to the prediction methods of 
flow-generated noise from air ducts, particularly pressure-based prediction 
techniques. Chapter 4 introduces the fundamental knowledge of vibra￾tion isolation and the assessment of the vibration isolation performance of 
vibrating ventilation equipment. Machine vibrations are complex. In prac￾tice, only a simple single-degree-of-freedom undamped lumped-parameter 
system, with a single contact point, is used to predict the vibration￾isolation performance. This chapter introduces a more accurate prediction 
method, that is the power transmissibility method, based on the overall xii Preface
structure-borne sound power transmission and dynamic characteristics of 
machines and floor structures. To understand the effect of the acoustic envir￾onment on people owing to vibration or sound sources, Chapter 5 discusses 
psychoacoustic approaches. The psychoacoustics perception scale (PPS), the 
first psychometric tool designed to quantitatively assess all fundamental per￾ceptual dimensions of sound, is introduced. Objective psychoacoustic metrics 
and subjective human responses in psychoacoustic prediction are discussed. 
Case studies and examples are provided to the readers in Chapter 6 to illus￾trate the prediction of duct transmission noise, flow-generated noise, vibra￾tion isolation performance, and human psychoacoustic response discussed 
in the previous chapters.
The authors hope this book helps inspire readers to get involved in 
this topic.

General building acoustics
1.1 INTRODUCTION
Noise and sound, which are both vibrations of air particles, are physically 
the same. Considering human aural perception, noise is typically regarded 
as an unwanted sound. The energy properties of acoustical environments 
are commonly characterised by measurements of the sound pressure level 
(SPL; IEC 801-22-07), which are instantaneous sound pressure fluctuations. 
Because there is a wide range of detectable sound pressures from the human 
threshold of hearing (root mean square (RMS) sound pressure of 20 µPa), 
SPL is measured on a logarithmic scale in terms of decibel (dB). Therefore, 
SPL cannot be averaged arithmetically. Hence, equivalent continuous sound 
levels (IEC 801-22-16) are applied to measure the time-averaged sound 
levels over the elapsed time (T) of the measurements. Most acoustic environ￾ments can be roughly estimated using several SPL measurements at different 
locations in the environment.
Environmental noise is formed by sounds at different frequencies. 
Frequency is the number of vibrations of air in a second; it is measured 
in Hertz (Hz). The audio frequency range is typically 20–20,000 Hz for 
any person with a normal hearing. Nonetheless, human hearing sensation 
depends on the frequency of the sounds. The human hearing system is more 
sensitive to 500–6,000 Hz than other frequencies in the audio frequency 
range. A-weighting, the most common frequency weighting in acoustical 
measurements, is a filter that approximates human ear responses. The 
A-weighted equivalent sound level (LAeq, T), a time-averaged energy level of 
the A-weighted SPL in a period of T, is a good indicator of the general 
acoustic environment.
1.2 FUNDAMENTALS OF ACOUSTICS
Acoustics is the scientific study of the generation, transmission, and recep￾tion of acoustic energy in the form of vibrational waves in an elastic medium 
[1]. Specifically, it deals with the space-time evolution of sound in an elastic 2 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
medium. Therefore, the sound pressure of a travelling harmonic wave can 
be represented by a sinusoidal function of space and time dependence. If 
sound waves propagate in free space without boundaries, sound reflection 
will not occur. However, sound waves exhibit phenomena such as multiple 
sound reflections, interference, and absorption when boundaries exist, such 
as in fully enclosed or semi-enclosed rooms or air ducts.
1.2.1 Building acoustics
Acoustics [2] is concerned with the generation and space-time evolution 
of small mechanical perturbations in a fluid (sound waves) or solid (elastic 
waves). An acoustic wave allows energy to be transferred from one point to 
another without any mean displacement of air particles in the medium between 
the two points. Sound is an aural sensation caused by pressure variations in 
air and is always produced by a source of vibration. For example, the com￾pressor of a condenser system gives rise to a succession of compressions and 
rarefactions, which radiate out from the source at the speed of sound. Sound 
is not only responsible for the sensation of hearing but is also governed by 
analogous physical principles. Noise problems in building acoustics are typ￾ically in the audio frequency range. This is referred to as the audio frequency 
range. Sounds with frequencies below 20 Hz are referred to as infrasound. 
Sounds with a frequency above 20,000 Hz are called ultrasound, the study 
of which is called ultrasonics. Both infrasound and ultrasound are regarded 
as sounds. The difference between acoustics and optics is that acoustics uses 
mechanical waves as opposed to electromagnetic ones.
Noise is an unwanted sound that has a negative impact on people. 
However, sound sources are inevitably present in the environment. 
Therefore, perceptions influenced by the acoustic environment are critical 
in differentiating desirable and undesirable sounds. Building acoustics [3] 
involves the science of controlling and predicting sound in buildings and 
studying the effects of sound on building occupants. This is an important 
issue because it is related to the indoor environmental quality, human com￾fort, and satisfaction. A holistic approach consisting of both objective and 
subjective information of the acoustic environment provides more compre￾hensive knowledge of noise control in buildings.
1.2.2 Energy feature
Sound pressure, sound intensity, and sound power are three physical quan￾tities related to the energy content of the acoustic environment. Both levels 
of these physical quantities are measured in decibels (dB), which is expressed 
as the ratio of two values of the quantities on a logarithmic scale. One 
decibel is 1/10 of Bel (B), named after Alexander Graham Bell. The decibel 
is more famous in acoustics because 1 dB is the only noticeable difference General building acoustics 3
in sound intensity for the normal human ear. The logarithmic scale cor￾responds more closely to the wide range of the human hearing response, 
from the standard threshold of hearing at 1,000 Hz to the threshold of 
pain at some ten trillion times that intensity. In addition, normal algebraic 
addition is not generally applicable to the addition/subtraction of levels. In 
general, an increase of 3 dB represents doubling of the quantities. Detailed 
definitions of the logarithmic and related quantities can be found in the IEC 
Standard 60027-3:2002.
Sound pressure, p(t), is a measure of the small pressure perturbation 
above atmospheric pressure in Pascal (Pa). This quantity is affected by the 
surrounding environment. It can be heard in the audio frequency range and 
can be measured using the acoustic equipment. The effective sound pressure 
of an acoustic measurement is referred to as the RMS value of instantaneous 
sound pressure over a time interval, T, at a location, pRMS, T.
 The minimum 
sound pressure that can be captured by the human ear is 20 μPa (2×10-5 Pa). 
It was chosen as the reference sound pressure, p0, in the SPL (or Lp). The 
SPL value is defined as follows:

Two detector response times (Fast and Slow) are commonly applied in 
SPL measurements. This indicates how rapidly the detector output signal 
changes in response to a sudden change in the input signal. Fast has a time 
constant of T = 0.125 s, whereas Slow has a time constant of T = 1 s.
Sound power, W, is the energy emitted by a sound source per unit time 
measured in Watts (W). This quantity is an inherent property of a sound 
source, and is independent of the environment. The reference sound power, 
W0, was chosen to be 10–12 W in the sound power level (LW) calculation, as 
follows:

The sound intensity, I, is the acoustic energy passing through a unit area 
per second in watt per area (W/m2). This quantity changes with the distance 
from the sound sources. The reference sound intensity, I0, was chosen to be 
10–12 Wm–2 in the sound intensity level (LI

1.2.2.1 Sound field
If a sound wave is emitted by a source and spherically propagated in a free-​
field (direct field) environment with a homogeneous, steady, and simple fluid 
or elastic solid without reflection, diffraction, absorption, and dispersion, the 
relationships of pRMS, I, and W at a distance r from the source will be

where Z denotes the characteristic acoustic impedance of the medium. Z
is equal to the density of the medium (ρ; kgm-3) times the speed of sound 
(c; ms–1). For the air media, Z = 428 kgm–2s–1 at 0°C and Z = 413 kgm–2s–1
at 0°C. The LI
 of a loud sound causes pain to the ear, usually between 115 
and 140 dB.
It is necessary to understand the sound fields inside an enclosed space 
for indoor noise control and prediction of noise and vibration from ven￾tilation systems. The sound field in an enclosed space is strongly affected 
by the reflective properties of the enclosed surfaces in a room. Owing to 
the reflective surfaces, multiple reflections occur, and a diffused-field (rever￾berant field) is established in addition to the direct field from the sound 
source. Therefore, at any point in an enclosure, the overall SPL is a function 
of the energy contained in the direct and reverberant fields.
Direct sound is the sound that travels from the source to the receiver 
without undergoing reflection at any boundary. In real-life situations, sound 
sources in an indoor room are not perfect point sources that radiate sound 
energy equally in all directions. Therefore, a directivity factor is required 
to describe the angular dependence of sound intensity. After applying a 
directivity factor, Qθ, to Eqs. 1.4, the intensity due to the direct sound is 
given by
I WQ
r Dir = θ

The SPL due to direct sound, in terms of the LW of the source, is then given by

 L L Q

(1.6)
The value of Qθ depends on the acoustic characteristics of the source and its 
position relative to the surface of the room. If the acoustic characteristics of 
the source are not known, then it is usually sufficient to assume a unidirec￾tional source and take the value of Qθ appropriate to the source position in 
the room (see Table 1.1).
The directivity index DIθ is defined as:
DI Q θ θ = 10 10 log (1.7)
In the free-field condition, there were no surfaces obstructing sound propa￾gation. However, the sound field in a room travels only a short distance 
before it strikes the surface. Because all the reflected sound rays strike at least 
one boundary, the SPL of the reverberant sound depends on the amount of 
absorption at the boundary materials. The reverberant sound level builds 
up to a level where the rate of the supply of sound energy from the source is 
equal to the rate at which it is absorbed at the room surface.
The reverberant sound pressure level, SPLRev, depends on the LW of the 
sound, a quantity called the room constant.

which depends on the total area of the room surface S and the average

The absorption coefficient α represents the random incidence absorption 
coefficient of a material and is defined as the proportion of energy absorbed 
by a surface to the incident energy on the surface.
The average absorption coefficient, α , is the average value over all room 
surfaces, Si

All objects in the room, for example, people and furniture, provide absorp￾tion and should be considered when calculating the average absorption 
coefficient of the room. The absorption per object, multiplied by the total 
number of objects, was added to the top line of the formula. Stotal does not 
change when considering objects in the room.
Hence, the total SPL was determined by the logarithmic addition of the 
direct and reverberant sound levels in Eqs. 1.6 and 1.9.

The direct sound of a point source falls by 6 dB per doubling of the dis￾tance, whereas the reverberant sound is the same at all positions in the room.
1.2.3 Spectral feature
1.2.3.1 Octave scale
The sound spectrum (IEC 801-21-15) is the magnitude of the sound fre￾quency components. This is also referred to as the spectral distribution of 
the acoustic energy. The temporal wave of the sound pressure, p(t), can be 
transformed by Fourier analysis into the frequency spectrum, Lp(f). If the 
wave is a periodic sound, then a discrete frequency spectrum is obtained. 
A continuous frequency spectrum was obtained if the wave was a random 
sound. As most sound waveforms are random in the time domain, real-life 
waveforms usually have all components within the frequency range in Lp(f). 
For vibration studies, the frequency bands of the spectrum were in units of 
Hz. The spectrum may cover the frequency range of infrasound and ultra￾sound, as the haptic sense caused by vibration will also be of research interest.
For Lp(f) covering the audio frequency range, frequency analysis is essen￾tial to identify the acoustic characteristics of the environment, determine the 
dominant frequency bands, and hence design appropriate noise controls. 
The octave or 1/3 octave scale and Bark scale are typically applied for General building acoustics 7
frequency analysis in acoustic and psychoacoustic measurements, respect￾ively. The octave (IEC 801-30-09) scale splits the auditable spectrum into 
ten equal logarithmic frequency bands. 1/3 octaves further divide the spec￾trum into 33 bands. The 1/3 octave spectrum is typically used to analyse 
the spectral content of sounds. An audiometry exam test of hearing ability 
is also based on the diagnosis of hearing thresholds at the octave or 1/3 
octave bands.
Each octave band is named by the centre frequency, fc, which is the geo￾metric mean of the upper frequency limit of an octave band, fcut-off_up, and the 
lower frequency limit of the band fcut-off_low, and is given as follows:
f f f c cut off up cut off low = × − − _ _ (1.12)
Because the ratio of fcut-off_up to fcut-off_low for each octave band is always 2, 
fcut-off_up and fcut-off_low can be expressed in terms of fc as follows:
f f f f cut off up c cut off low c or − − = = _ _ 2 1

a 1/3 octave band, the relationship between fup_c and flow_c is as follows:

1.2.3.2 Bark scale
The Bark scale, also called the psychoacoustical scale, was proposed by 
Zwicker in 1961 [4]. The upper frequency limit, the lower frequency limit, 
and the central frequency of all critical bands (Bark bands) in the Bark 
scale included the measurement results of a series of experiments on the 
threshold for complex sounds, considering the masking, the perception of 
phase, and most often the loudness of complex sounds. Compared with the 
octave scale, the exact relationship between the frequency limits and central 
frequency cannot be found for the Bark scale. The entire audio frequency 
range was divided into 24 Barks. The 24-Bark spectrum is represented by 
the specific loudness, N′, over the critical bands. The comparison tables of 
the different frequency scales in terms of 1/3 octave, octave, and Bark bands 
are shown in Figure 1.1.8 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
Figure 1.1 Comparison tables of different frequency scale in terms of (a) 1/3 octave 
(/octave) bands and (b) Bark bands applied in building acoustics.General building acoustics 9
1.2.3.3 Frequency dependency of loudness sensation
It is well known that human hearing thresholds differ at different frequency 
bands and are related to the age and gender (ISO 7029:2017 [5]) of people. 
Our ears are frequency-selective, being most sensitive between 500 Hz and 
6,000 Hz, compared with our overall hearing range from 20 Hz to 20,000 
Hz. The ear is a non-linear device with sensitivity and can tolerate higher 
loudness levels at low frequencies. Sound loudness is a subjective term 
that describes the strength of the ear’s perception of sound. It is intimately 
related to intensity but can by no means be considered identical to the 
intensity. The sound intensity must be factored into by the ear’s sensitivity 
to the frequencies contained in the sound loudness contours (ISO 226:2003 
[6]). Based on the equal soundness contours, which indicate the variation 
for the average human ear, 1,000 Hz is chosen as a standard frequency to 
define phon. While a pure tone sound is perceived to be as loud as a 60 dB 
sound at 1,000 Hz, it is believed to have a loudness of 60 phon. The use 
of phon as a unit of loudness is an improvement over just quoting the level 
in decibels; however, it is still not a measurement which is directly propor￾tional to loudness. The sone scale was created to provide a linear scale for 
loudness. One sone loudness corresponds to a level of 40 dB for a 1,000 
Hz tone. The empirical formula relating the loudness N (in sones) to the 
loudness level LN (in phons) derived from subjective tests on the listener is 
as follows:

1.2.3.4 Frequency weighting
Frequency weighting filters correlate the sound level meter (objective) 
measurements with subjective human responses. Our subjective response 
is also loudness dependent; therefore, early sound level meters/analysers 
included A, B, C, and Z (zero) and linear or flat frequency weightings to 
consider the responses. The weighting network scales are used in practice to 
add the loudness contribution from all bands. The most general one is the 
A-weighting scale, designed to approximate the ear at approximately the 
40 phon level (inverted equal-loudness contour). The B- and C-weighting 
networks are inverted 70 and 100 phon loudness contours, respectively; 
however, they are less popular currently. All these weighting filters are 
based on the 1/3 ocatave scale of the SPL measurement data. The unit of 
the SPL measurement will be changed to dB(A), dB(B), or dB(C) if A-, B-, 
or C-weighting is applied in the measurement. A-weighting is the most 
widely used frequency weighting in environmental noise policy, regulations, 10 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
and guidelines, as it shows a good estimation of the perceived noise level 
captured by human ears.
1.2.4 Temporal feature
The SPL in Eq. 1.1 is the level for a tiny time interval of the detector response 
time, T. For indoor acoustic measurements, the elapsed time, TE, can be up 
to minutes, hours, and even a day.
1.2.4.1 Equivalent indicator
When the noise is not stationary but does not change significantly with 
time, it is convenient to add up all quadratic pressures p2
x(t) (i.e. all acoustic 
energy) over a period of time and provide an average quadratic pressure. 
Equivalent continuous sound pressure level, Lxeq_TE, is therefore designed 
based on this average quadratic pressure over a given TE. In addition, 
the value of Lxeq_TE can be calculated from the N (= TE/T) number of the 
measured SPL during the entire measurement, as follows:

where Lxn is the nth instantaneous x-weighted (e.g. A, B, C, and Z) SPL level 
of the detector response time. For example, sound from ventilation is usu￾ally accepted to be steady during operation. The A-weighted equivalent con￾tinuous SPL of 30 min, LAeq_30mins, is a suitable acoustic metric to represent 
the general acoustic characteristics of the noise.

For the percentile x-weighted SPL, LxN% is the SPL that exceeds N% of 
the measurement time TE, where N is usually chosen to be an integer. The 
statistical indicators LA10 and LA90 are widely used in measurements to deter￾mine the effects of significant noise sources and background noise in the 
environment, respectively. The maximum x-weighted SPL level (Lx_max) and 
that of minimum (Lx_min) are also two statistical indicators that describe the 
acoustic characteristics of the environment.General building acoustics 11
1.2.4.3 Reverberation time
When the sound source was switched off, the direct sound ceased imme￾diately, and the reverberant sound decayed at a rate that depended on the 
total absorption Sα in the room. The reverberation time RT is defined as 
the time taken for the sound to decay by 60 dB. In practice, a decay of 60 
dB is difficult to achieve, and RT is determined by doubling the time for a 
30 dB decay e.g., from −5 dB to −35 dB. The Sabine formula developed by 
Wallace Clement Sabine is an approximate expression for the RT of a room 
and is as follows:
RT V
S = 0.161 , α
(1.17)
where Sα is the total absorption of the room and V is the room volume. 
RT is also the principal parameter for assessing the suitability of the acous￾tics of a room for the proposed room. In addition, RT values vary with the 
sound frequency. As the absorption coefficients of room surfaces generally 
increase with increasing frequency, the RT of a room generally decreases 
with increasing frequency. The optimum RT quoted can be at the 500 Hz 
octave band. Although RT is the most common and useful parameter for 
assessing the acoustical quality of an architectural space, studies [7, 8] 
have revealed that the energy decay may not be uniform. Other acoustical 
parameters associated with the early part of energy decay such as early 
decay time (EDT) are also used for assessing the acoustical quality of an 
architectural space such as a church.
1.3 INDOOR ASSESSMENT OF SOUND AND VIBRATION
1.3.1 Acoustic criteria
The equivalent continuous SPL Lxeq_TE is a single-value parameter. However, 
spectral content is important as it provides information about sound 
quality. Other noise criteria used in assessing the acoustic performance of 
air-conditioned spaces include noise criterion (NC), noise rating (NR), and 
room criterion (RC) curves. The properties of noise, including the sound 
pressure level, loudness, frequency content, tonal components, impul￾siveness, and level fluctuations, determine whether the noise is accept￾able. Psychoacoustics is related to human auditory response to sound. 
Psychoacoustic metrics provide a sense of sound quality.
1.3.1.1 Noise criterion curves
Noise criterion (NC) is one of the earliest designed and widely applicable 
indoor noise criteria. NC curves (see Figure 1.2) were developed in 12 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
1957 by Beranek in the U.S.A. [9]. The NC curves include eight octave 
bands from 63 Hz to 8,000 Hz and the shape of the curves approximates 
the equal loudness contours developed in the early 1930s by Fletcher and 
Munson. The NC curves can help return a single NC value of an unoccu￾pied space in buildings from the spectrum of the background SPL of the 
space. The NC values can serve as a criterion to compare different acoustic 
environments and check whether the SPL of the acoustic environments 
is within the acceptable range. The NC value was determined by deter￾mining the lowest NC curve that was not reached by the spectrum of the 
background SPL of the acoustic environment. For example, the octave 
band spectra of different acoustic environments E1 and E2 are plotted 
in Figure 1.4(a). The lowest NC curve was not reached by the measured 
spectra for NC-45. Therefore, environments E1 and E2 had the same NC
value as NC-45. This example also demonstrates that NC value is not 
sufficient to distinguish the spectral features of different acoustic environ￾ments. Hence, different indoor noise criteria such as Balanced Noise 
Figure 1.2 Noise criterion (NC) curves and the recommended NC values for different 
types of unoccupied space.General building acoustics 13
Criteria (NCB), Preferred Noise Criteria (PNC), Room Criteria Mark II 
(RC Mark II) were designed [10] to have a more comprehensive quantifi￾cation of indoor acoustical environments.
1.3.1.2 Noise rating curves
Noise rating (NR) curves (see Figure 1.3) were developed in 1962 by 
Kosten and Van Os. The indoor criteria NR is more commonly applied in 
Europe, while NC is more commonly applied in the U.S.A. The NR curves 
Figure 1.3 Noise rating (NR) curves.14 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
are generated by a formula of the frequency-band dependent constants, a 
and b, which are added to the octave band SPL for NR level, SPLNR = a +
b × SPLoctave. The naming of each NR curve is designed using the SPL at 
the 1,000-Hz octave band. Compared with the NC curves, the NR curves 
include one more octave band (31.5 Hz) and cover a larger range from NR
0 to NR 130. Furthermore, the NR curves are steeper for low-frequency 
bands, representing a greater tolerance to low-frequency sounds. The deter￾mination of the NR value is similar to that of the NC value, to determine 
the lowest NR curve that is not reached by the SPL spectrum of the environ￾ment. The NC value can be used to quantify the acoustic environment and 
hence as a criterion to assess the acceptance of hearing preservation, speech 
communication, and annoyance of different environments, as stated in the 
ISO Recommendation ISO/R 1996-1971 [11]. Using acoustic environments 
E1 and E2, which have the same NC value as an example (see Figure 1.4(b)), 
the NR value of E1 (NR-​44) is different from that of E2 (NR-47).
1.3.1.3 Room criterion curves
To distinguish the spectral features of different acoustic environments, RC
curves were developed. The details of the RC curves can be found in the 
American National Standard Criteria (ANSI S12.2-2019) for evaluating room 
noise [12]. The RC curves were also recommended by the American Society 
of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) on 
the basis of specifying the design level in terms of a well-balanced spectrum 
shape. The RC curves included nine octave bands from 16 Hz to 4,000 Hz. 
The acoustic environment can be regarded as an optimum balance if all 
the individual octave band SPL of the environment are within ±2 dB of the 
octave band SPL for the RC level. Moreover, the RC curves not only provide 
a single RC value but also facilitate the sign of the spectral features 
of the environment. For example, there are two acoustic environments, E1 
and E2, with the same NC value (see Figure 1.4(c)–(d)) and vastly different 
spectra. In fact, the E1 will be subjectively perceived to be ‘rumbly’ because 
it is relatively rich in low frequencies. The E2 will be subjectively perceived 
to be ‘hissy’ because it is relatively rich in high frequencies. However, the 
NC and NR values could not distinguish between the spectral features of E1 
and E1. The arithmetic average of the SPL at the 500-, 1,000-, and 2,000-
Hz octave bands is the RC value. Therefore, the RC values of E1 and E2 are 
RC-37 and RC-44, respectively. Starting from the RC value at the 1,000-
Hz octave band, a straight line with a slope of 5 dB per octave band was 
drawn. Subsequently, two lines (R-line and H-line) were drawn parallel to 
the straight line. The R-line will be to the left of the 500-Hz band and 5 dB 
above, and the H-line will be to the right of the 1,000-Hz band and 3 dB 
above. The sign of the spectral feature of the environment, ‘Rumble (R)’ 
or ‘Hiss (H)’, is given if the SPL spectrum of the environment exceeds the General building acoustics 15
R-line or H-line. Therefore, E1 and E2 were determined as RC-37 (R) and 
RC-44(H), respectively. If neither the individual octave band SPL of the 
environment excess the R-line and H-line, the sign of the spectral feature of 
the environment will be ‘Neutral (N)’.
1.3.1.4 Psychoacoustics metrics
Psychoacoustics is a science that investigates the objective characteristics 
and subjective perceptual influence of sound. A psychoacoustic approach 
that considers both auditory and non-auditory factors provides a higher 
Figure 1.4 Examples of determinations of (a) NC values; (b) NR values; and (c)–(d) RC
values of the acoustical environments 1 and 2 (E1 and E2).16 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
accuracy in audience perceptual judgements. Psychoacoustic metrics are a 
series of objective metrics for estimating the actual sensations of sounds based 
on the psychoacoustical scale (Bark scale) proposed by Eberhard Zwicker 
in 1961 [4]. Total loudness (N), the estimation of the loudness sensation, is 
the most common psychoacoustic metric in psychoacoustic measurements 
[4]. The spectral and temporal effects on loudness sensation, the transmis￾sion characteristics of human outer and middle ear structures, and the non￾linear relationships between sound stimuli and loudness judgements [13] are 
considered in the N calculation. The international ISO 532 [14] standardises 
the method of the N calculation method. Moreover, the spectral content of 
acoustical environments can be characterised by measurements of sharpness 
(S), which is a psychoacoustic metric used to estimate the sharpness sen￾sation by calculating the energy skewness of sounds [4]. The details of the 
use of the Bark scale in psychoacoustic approaches will be discussed in 
Chapter 5.
1.4 NOISE PROBLEMS
Noise and undesired and unpleasant sounds have always been key issues 
in environmental management [15]. Environmental awareness of the 
negative impacts of noise has increased over the last two decades [16]. 
There is an increasing amount of scientific evidence on the impact of 
noise [17]. Because the noise level of ventilation sounds is much smaller 
than the value of 70 dB(A), which causes noise-induced hearing loss in 
long exposure, psychoacoustic approaches are more important for iden￾tifying psychological impacts such as acoustic comfort, satisfaction, pref￾erence, acceptance, stress, and annoyance from ventilation noise. Other 
physiological impacts [15] such as the risk of high blood pressure, cardiac 
arrest, tinnitus, and sleep disturbance, and impacts on performance [18, 
19] such as concentration and memory, are also the focus of researchers 
in the field.
1.5 SOUND AND VIBRATION FROM VENTILATION 
SYSTEMS
The identification of source noise characteristics is a primary consideration 
for source noise control. Measurements were required to identify the most 
significant noise sources in the environment. Duct-​borne sound, airborne 
sound, and structure-​borne sound are the three common types of sounds 
existing in building ventilation systems (see Figure 1.5). In this section, the 
discussion is primarily focused on engineering practices for noise control of 
ventilation noise.General building acoustics 17
1.6 CONTROL METHODS FOR BUILDING ACOUSTICS
The principal purpose of noise control in building acoustics is to ensure 
that the acoustic environment of rooms in a building fulfils predetermined 
acoustic standards and design criteria. Control of sound sources and trans￾mission paths are two major types of engineering practices for ventilation 
noise in buildings. Mechanical equipment such as air-cooled chillers, water￾cooling towers, and fans are well accepted as noise sources in ventilation 
systems. Therefore, the relocation of noisy equipment, replacement of quieter 
Figure 1.5 Schematic of the common engineering practices {reference number see 
Table 1.2} for the noise control of the different types of ventilation noise in 
buildings.18 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
equipment, and routine maintenance of equipment are common engineering 
practices for controlling sound sources. The basic concept in the control 
of the sound transmission path involves reducing the propagating sound 
energy from the noise sources to receivers. Installation of sound absorption 
materials to equipment surfaces and room surfaces, soundproofing barriers 
between sources and receivers, partial or complete enclosure of equipment, 
and silencers to reduce airborne sound are common engineering practices 
for controlling transmission noise. The common practices for the control of 
different types of sounds existing in the ventilation systems of buildings are 
listed and shown in Table 1.2 and Figure 1.5.
1.6.1 Controls of duct-borne sound
The sounds of fans in ventilation ductwork systems, as well as the sounds 
induced by the interaction between solid obstacles and airflow in ducts, 
can be transmitted between the duct and spaces through the duct surfaces. 
All these sounds can bother nearby residents at the air outlets of ductwork 
systems or in spaces involving air ducts. The mechanisms of the different 
types of duct-borne sounds are discussed in Chapter 2. All of these may cause 
noise disturbances to nearby residents. Therefore, additional stiffening and 
composite lagging of sound absorbing materials around the vibrating duct 
surfaces are effective measures to reduce vibration and induce duct-borne 
sound at duct surfaces. In addition, the installation of flexible connectors 
between fans and ducts can help reduce the transmission of fan sounds to a 
ductwork system. The position change of the duct opening away from the

receivers can also increase the sound transmission path to reduce duct-borne 
sounds from the ventilation ductwork systems to receivers. The predicted 
SPL attenuation and percentage drop of the loudness level at different 
distances from a point sound source are listed in Table 1.3. The predictions 
of SPL attenuation are based on the inverse square distance law (see Eq. 1.6) 
and the approximation of the psychoacoustic metric N in the inverse power 
0.46 of the distance from a noise source as experimented and proposed by 
Ma et al., respectively [20].
1.6.2 Controls of airborne sound
Airborne sound can be generated from the flow turbulence of rotating fan 
blades, water spraying and falling in water-cooling towers, and compressor 
operation of air-cooled chillers in refrigeration cycles in ventilation duct￾work systems of buildings. For fan sounds, the reduction in rotational fan 
speed can help control the SPL of the airborne sound during off-peak hours.

Notes: The sound source is assumed to be a point source. * N is the reference value of the 
psychoacoustic metric (total loudness) measured 1 m from the sound source. The reverberant 
sound is assumed to be zero.20 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
A partial enclosure is usually applied to a stationary noise source that 
requires space for air supply and/or exhaust or for accessibility. The par￾tial enclosure can be a composite of one or more partition(s), wall(s), 
barrier(s), or panel(s) to block the transmission path of airborne sounds 
from a sound source to receivers. The transmission path of sounds can be 
further increased by placing a barrier closer to the sound source or using 
a higher barrier. The soundproof performance of the partial enclosure can 
be increased if the surface(s) facing the sound source are lined with sound 
absorption materials, and there is a good seal between the surfaces. Silencers 
can also be installed together with a partial enclosure at the air intake and/
or discharge point(s) of a noise source to absorb the generated airborne 
sounds. For water-cooling towers, the installation of an acoustic mat and 
lined vent cowl can help reduce water falling and spraying sounds from the 
operation. The lined vent cowl can divert the direction of the sound trans￾mission path away from the receiver.
If the sound sources are unavoidably surrounded by residents in all 
directions, a complete enclosure is considered. The sound reduction index, 
SRI, is a basic measure of the sound insulation of a partition, and the for￾mula for SRI measurement according to ISO 140-3:1995 [21] is as follows:
SRI SPL SPL source receiver = − + × 10 10 log ,
S
A (1.18)
where SPLsource is the average SPL in the source room, SPLreceiver
 is the 
average SPL in the receiver room, S is the area of the testing material, 
and A is the equivalent absorption area in the receiver room. The SRI of 
different typical materials according to ISO 15712-1 [22] are shown in 
Figure 1.6. A complete enclosure is similar to a partial enclosure; all the 
surface(s) facing a sound source should be lined with sound absorption 
materials to achieve better performance. Functional and sufficient heat 
or air exchange is required to prevent equipment overheating. Therefore, 
the installation of silencers together with a complete enclosure at the air 
intake and discharge positions is significant for absorbing airborne sounds 
but allows air exchange from the enclosed equipment to the surroundings. 
If impact sounds can be generated from the operation of the equipment, 
the floating floor can be an efficient control measure to isolate the sounds 
transmitted to receivers in the rooms below the equipment. An acoustic 
floating floor is a resilient layer suspended above existing structural slabs 
of buildings. The enclosed air spaces inside the floating floor can help 
absorb the sounds emitted from the equipment. It can also serve as a pro￾tective layer for the existing structural slabs. Therefore, careful defect 
checking should be performed at the installation stage of the floating floor. 
Defects are difficult to repair because heavy equipment may be placed 
above the floating floor.General building acoustics 21
1.6.3 Controls of structure-borne sound
The transmission of structure-borne sound occurs at the physical contact 
points between the sound sources and building structure. Therefore, an 
acoustic floating floor can not only reduce the airborne sound but also 
minimise the structure-borne sound and vibration generated from the 
equipment. A floating floor is useful for absorbing sounds and preventing 
them from arriving at the building structure. Consequently, a more 
pleasant acoustic environment can be provided to the rooms directly 
below the equipment. Vibrations generated from the operations of fans, 
air-cooled chillers, and water-cooling towers can be transmitted and may 
generate a breakout sound to the different rooms in the building through 
the building structure. Vibration isolators are a choice other than floating 
floors to reduce structure-borne sound and vibration transmission from 
the supporting points of the equipment to the building structure. Metal 
springs and rubber mounts are two major types of vibration isolators. The 
Figure 1.6 Sound reduction index of the different typical materials according to ISO 
15712-1.
Source: From Ref. [22].22 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
efficiency of vibration isolation is critically affected by the selection of the 
isolator type. The force transmissibility, isolation efficiency, and power 
transmissibility of the different types of vibration isolators are discussed 
in Chapter 4. In addition, engineers should consider the high-frequency 
sound generated from the metallic contacts of metal springs and the rela￾tively short lifetime of rubber mounts. Inertia blocks, which are usually 
large and heavy concrete blocks, are often installed between the vibrating 
equipment and vibration isolators to increase the stability and lower the 
centre of gravity of the ventilation systems. If possible, the relocation of 
the noisy equipment away from the rooms with receivers also controls the 
sounds from ventilation systems.
1.6.4 Psychoacoustic approach in noise control
The main idea of psychoacoustic techniques is understanding how indi￾viduals perceive, experience, and/or understand the acoustic environment. 
Compared with traditional noise management, psychoacoustic approaches 
emphasise that environmental sounds are regarded as resources (not 
wastes); loudness is not the only perception of sounds. The responses to 
different sound sources need to be differentiated. Noise level reduction is not 
equal to the improvement of the acoustical environment, and measurements 
of psychoacoustic metrics other than SPL are required. Differentiating the 
preferences for different sound sources is important. Noise masking with 
preferable sounds is a possible solution for modifying the public envir￾onment. Increased opportunities for exposure to natural sounds, particu￾larly water sounds or music, can promote the general sound quality of the 
environment.
1.7 PREDICTION METHODS FOR BUILDING ACOUSTICS
In the early planning stage of ventilation systems, actual acoustic informa￾tion of the building may not be available at this stage. Therefore, noise 
prediction is extremely important for the design of noise controls for ven￾tilation systems [23]. Three prediction methods are widely used in room 
acoustics: wave-based acoustic, geometrical acoustics, and diffusion 
equation methods. The application of these methods for the duct-​borne 
sound, airborne sound, and structure-​borne sound will be further discussed 
in Chapters 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
1.7.1 Wave-based acoustical methods
In wave-based acoustic methods, acoustic waves are assumed to propa￾gate in a homogeneous, steady, isotropic, and perfect elastic medium with General building acoustics 23
boundaries. The wave equations of the acoustic characteristics are com￾pletely defined by the functions of space and time. The assumptions of the 
conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in systems are described 
by the continuity equation, Euler’s equation, and state equation, respect￾ively. These equations can be further simplified by neglecting higher-order 
terms if the fluctuations of particle velocity, acoustic pressure, and medium 
density are assumed to be extremely small time-varying perturbations 
compared to their equilibrium values. The linear time-independent acoustic 
wave equation is then obtained as follows:

where p is the difference between the instantaneous values of the total 
and atmospheric pressures. Finite difference and finite element methods
are two common numerical methods used to approximate sound wave 
propagation in building rooms. This method is rapid and efficient for 
obtaining the energy features of rooms with simple shapes, well-defined 
boundary conditions, and dimensions smaller than the wavelength of 
the wave equation. Currently, numerical simulations are required to not 
only consider the energy feature but also the frequency feature of the 
acoustic environment. There is a challenge in terms of the computational 
power for more complicated situations and frequency-dependent acoustic 
characteristics.
1.7.1.1 Sound wave propagation in air ducts
This section is concerned with sound wave propagation in air ducts. The 
propagation of sound waves is affected by the reflective properties of fairly 
rigid surfaces in the air ducts. The effects of the duct walls on the propaga￾tion of sound waves in air ducts are briefly outlined. Wave-based acoustical 
methods can be not only applied to sound wave propagation in building 
rooms but also to sound wave propagation in air ducts.
Assuming a simple harmonic sound source in a rectangular duct of finite 
duct length and cross-sectional dimensions a and b, the interior of the duct 
is the region where 0<x<a, 0<y<b, and −∞<z<∞. In addition, we assumed 
that the duct walls were rigid.
Assuming a simple harmonic motion of a particular frequency, we have a 
three-dimension Helmholtz equation obtained from Eq. 1.19

It can be observed from Eq. 1.29 that the complete solution consists of an 
exponential function multiplied by the modal shape function. Duct modes
are definite patterns of variation in the amplitude over the cross-section of 
the air duct because of the interference among the multiple reflections from 
the duct walls.

For frequencies below the cut-on frequency of the first transverse duct mode, 
all modes are evanescent (cut-​off), and only plane waves are propagated, as 
shown in Figure 1.7. For simplicity, the magnitudes (Amn and Bmn) of the 
waves propagating in the +z and −z directions were assumed to be the same, 
as shown in Figure 1.7.
For frequencies above the cut-on frequency of the first transverse or 
higher-order duct modes, the modes are propagated, as shown in Figure 1.8.

and (b) a decaying mode at t = 0 s.General building acoustics 27
1.7.2 Geometrical acoustics methods
Geometrical acoustic methods are also called ray-acoustic methods. They 
involve the approximate theory; high-frequency sound in air is imagined as 
travelling in a straight line directly from the sound source to the receiver. 
The image source, ray tracing, and beam tracing methods can be classified 
as geometric-acoustic methods. The principal task of geometrical acoustics 
involves determining the trajectories of sound rays. Rays have the simplest 
form in a homogeneous medium, where they are straight lines.
1.7.3 Diffusion equation methods
A diffusion equation models the sound field in enclosures by diffusely 
reflecting boundaries. It has been successfully applied to predict room 
acoustic parameters, such as SPL, in room acoustics simulations. Finite 
difference method was used to obtain approximate solutions under the 
assumption of sufficiently scattered sound that requires completely diffu￾sive boundary conditions. The absorption and scattering coefficients of the 
boundaries were also considered in the diffusion equation models.
1.7.4 Machine-learning methods
Compared with traditional acoustic approaches, the results of machine￾learned methods are data-driven models instead of explicit equations of 
Figure 1.8 Examples of the modal sharp functions in different duct modes (m, n) for sound 
propagation in a rigid air duct of a dimension of a × b m at t = 0 s.28 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
acoustic and non-acoustic variables. Any type of data can be the input and 
output of machine learning methods. The training of the models was based 
on datasets of the designed input and output variables. For example, training 
data can consist of acoustic and psychoacoustic metrics as input variables 
and psychological and physiological noise impacts as output variables. The 
features of complex real-life situations are learned and stored in weight 
matrices inside the machine-learned models. Machine-learned models can 
predict a new situation based on previous training datasets; however, the 
internal structures of the models are complicated for humans to compre￾hend. This is why machine-learned methods are also called black-box 
methods. Nevertheless, the rapid development of machine learning methods 
has significant potential for noise control in the future.

Duct-borne sound prediction 
and control
2.1 INTRODUCTION
The main purpose of a ductwork system is to provide a suitable amount 
of fresh or conditioned air to an indoor environment. To achieve a good 
indoor environmental quality, acoustic requirements are as important as 
thermal requirements in the design of ventilation and air-conditioning 
systems. To accomplish the acoustic requirements and design criteria, we 
need to acknowledge the different types of duct-borne noise problems 
and their generation, transmission, and prediction. In general, three types 
of noise problems may be encountered in a typical ventilation ductwork 
system. These are the primary noise, breakout noise, and secondary noise.
Primary noise is also known as transmission noise. The source of primary 
noise in ventilation ductwork systems is fans, which provide air movement 
and overcomes the pressure drops across the ductwork systems. Because 
there is much well-established primary noise information [1, 2], it is not a 
problem for the ventilation system designer to determine how much of the 
sound generated by fans is transmitted through ductwork systems. In add￾ition, there are well-established methods for selecting attenuators to control 
the fan noise transmitted through ducted systems. Hence, problems arising 
from primary noise sources are relatively rare.
Breakout noise is the sound that leaves the system at points other than 
duct terminations. Therefore, it is more difficult to solve problems arising 
from the ‘breakout’ of noise through the walls of the ductwork along which 
it is passing. In general, this may be due to fan noise, aerodynamic noise 
from the interaction of airflow, and duct fittings or airborne noise arising 
from the turbulent airflow interacting with duct walls.
Secondary noise is also known as regenerated or flow-​generated noise
and is a type of aerodynamic noise. Generally, aerodynamic noise in ducts 
is produced by the interaction between solid obstacles and high-speed or 
unsteady airflow. In ventilation system design, it is common to have duct 
corners, changing duct cross-sections, branch points, dampers, and terminal 
diffusers. Therefore, with these geometrical discontinuities, the production 32 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
of turbulence is unavoidable. The noise produced in this manner in venti￾lation systems is known as regenerated noise because it is generated on the 
quiet side of the primary attenuators of the ventilation system. With the 
advent of high-velocity ventilation systems, and as building materials and 
structures are becoming lighter, the prediction and possible minimisation of 
regenerated noise is of great importance. It is known that all in-duct elem￾ents generate flow noise in a ventilation system; even an attenuator that 
is supposed to reduce noise, also generates noise. Consequently, it is very 
important to predict the amount of flow noise generated during the design 
stage. A more detailed discussion of flow-generated noise is provided in 
Chapter 3.
2.2 PRIMARY NOISE
To estimate the attenuation of transmission noise for practical engineering 
purposes, we need to consider the sound power levels of the fan fed into the 
ductwork system, the acoustic energy being attenuated by the system (such 
as attenuation provided by silencers), and room corrections.
2.2.1 Sound power levels of the fan
A ventilation fan is a device operated by the aerodynamic action of a rotating 
impeller to continuously drive air through the ductwork system to the 
indoor environment. Fan noise is caused by mechanical noise from motors 
and bearings, aerodynamic noise due to rotational noise produced by the 
interaction between the impeller blades and the surrounding air, and vortex 
noise due to the turbulent flow across the impeller blades. Different types of 
fans affect the operating and noise characteristics to suit the different needs 
of applications. There are two major types of fans.
1. Centrifugal fans that propel air centrifugally (Figure 2.1(a))
2. Axial flow fans that propel air axially (Figure 2.1(b))
In general, the noise spectrum of an axial flow fan has a peak at a higher 
frequency than that of a centrifugal fan of similar duty.
2.2.2 Ductwork system attenuation
The original acoustic energy fed into the system by the fan was reduced as it 
passed down the ductwork system. The attenuation of this acoustic energy 
by each component of the ductwork system is briefly discussed herein. 
Tables and charts for ductwork system attenuation can be found in prac￾tical design guides or handbooks [1–4].Duct-borne sound prediction and control 33
2.2.2.1 Attenuation per unit duct length
Noise from the fan is transmitted and attenuated along the duct since the 
duct walls are not perfectly rigid. Sound attenuation is due to excitation 
of the duct wall vibration; molecular air absorption inside the duct can be 
ignored, as shown in Figure 2.2. Part of the excitation energy is used to 
overcome the internal damping of the duct material. Consequently, it was 
converted into heat. The remaining excitation energy is radiated from the 
duct as the breakout noise. In practice, it is usually assumed that sound 
power produced by the fan is continuously and linearly reduced along the 
plain duct length such that the reduction of sound power levels by the duct 
of constant duct cross-sectional area can be expressed as ‘attenuation per 
metre run’ (i.e., dB/m). The ductwork can be circular or rectangular in cross 
section. The circular duct tends to be stiffer than the rectangular duct of the 
same cross-sectional area because more acoustic energy can pass along 
the circular duct. The circular duct exhibits less in-duct attenuation than the 
rectangular duct at low to medium frequencies.
2.2.2.2 Attenuation due to bends and duct fittings
The attenuation of sound energy is obtained by the partial reflection of 
medium- and high-frequency sound back towards the source at bends or by 
the corresponding geometry changes where airflow changes direction or is 
expanded/restricted.
Figure 2.1 Schematic diagrams of (a) a centrifugal fan and (b) an axial flow fan.34 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
2.2.2.3 Attenuation at ductwork contractions and expansions
As mentioned earlier, sound attenuation can be obtained at the points of 
ductwork contractions or expansions. The mechanism involved is similar to 
that of a bend, in which medium- and high-frequency sounds are reflected 
along the duct. The amount of sound attenuation obtained is a function of 
the steepness of the area change (i.e. the more acute, the higher the attenu￾ation) and the ratio of the cross-sectional areas of the ductwork.
2.2.2.4 Attenuation due to branches
The total acoustic energy at a branch was divided between the main and 
branch ducts. It is assumed that this division of energy is directly propor￾tional to the division of airflow, and there is no sound absorption or reflec￾tion at a branch.
2.2.2.5 Attenuation due to duct terminations
When the sound energy reaches the end of the duct, it goes into the volume 
of the ventilated room. Owing to the extreme increase in volume (or change 
in acoustic impedance), acoustic energy loss occurs. These losses indicate 
that some of the acoustic energy was reflected in the duct space and their 
amount was frequency dependent. In other words, the losses depend on the 
wavelength of the sound and the size of the duct. This acoustic attenuation 
at duct termination is called ‘end reflection loss’, which were particularly 
prominent at low frequencies and for smaller areas of termination.
2.2.3 Control of sound in the ventilated room
The sound pressure level at any point in a room consists of direct and rever￾berant sounds.

Direct sound is influenced by the sound power emerging from a single 
outlet, the distance between the source (the duct outlet) and the receiver 
(a person inside the room) and directivity factors (surface and source). The 
reverberant sound is influenced by all the duct outlets in the room and is 
dependent on the room volume and total absorption available from the 
room surface or contents.
2.2.4 Noise control methods for ventilation ductwork 
system
In addition to sound control within the room, noise control methods that 
can be used to reduce duct-borne sound transmission include the use of 
a plenum chamber, package attenuators or silencers, duct liners or semi￾active noise control, and active noise control. Although passive noise con￾trol methods, such as duct liners and silencers, seem to consume more 
material resources than semi-active and active systems, the latter requires 
sensors, controllers, resonators or loudspeakers, and electricity. According 
to a study conducted by Mak et al. [5] that combined the analytic hierarchy 
process and life cycle analysis to obtain a holistic view of the system per￾formance in terms of human, economic and environmental impacts, it was 
found that the most sustainable design was duct liners, followed by silencers, 
active noise control, and semi-active noise control. This is probably the 
reason why duct liners and dissipative silencers are the most common noise 
control methods used in the noise control of ventilation ductwork systems. 
However, traditional methods, including dissipative and passive reactive 
silencers, suffer from some serious drawbacks, despite their wide use in 
duct noise control. The dissipative silencer performs well at medium to 
high frequencies but fails to be effective at low frequencies because of its 
high-impedance characteristics. The accumulation of dust and bacterial 
breeding in porous sound absorption materials is a notable issue related 
to public health. Passive reactive silencers, Helmholtz Resonators (HRs), 
and expansion chambers are typical examples that exhibit stable noise￾attenuation performance and can be tuned conveniently. Nevertheless, the 
volume of the expansion chamber must be sufficiently large to handle low￾frequency noises. The presence of HR offers a solution to low-frequency 
noise control; however, it is regarded as a narrow-band noise attenuator 
that is only effective at its resonance frequency over a relatively narrow 
frequency range. Over the years, several investigators have attempted 
to devise a method for controlling duct-borne low-frequency noise over 
a wide working frequency range. An array of differently tuned HRs or 36 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
micro-perforated tube mufflers was studied by Mak’s research team [6–12] 
to reduce low-frequency broadband noise, as shown in Figure 2.3. The 
use of an array of periodic HRs mounted on the duct can provide a much 
broader low-frequency noise attenuation band, owing to the coupling 
effects of the Bragg reflection and resonance of the HRs.
2.2.5 Summary
Noise is generated by the fan and transmitted through the ductwork. The 
noise emerging from duct termination was finally discharged into the 
ventilated room. A summary of the system noise attenuation is shown in 
Figure 2.4.
2.3 BREAKOUT NOISE
Breakout noise may radiate from a long duct run when there is a high level 
of internal sound fields or internal flow turbulence; a simple predictive 
equation is available in the CIBSE guide [2] for the estimation of the sound 
power radiated from the length of the duct.

where Lw F, is the sound power radiating from the duct (W), Lw D, is the sound 
power in the duct (W), R is the sound reduction index of the duct wall 
material, Sd
 is the surface area of the duct wall (i.e. duct perimeter × duct 
length) (m2) and Ad is the cross-sectional area of the duct (m2).
This is an equation for the estimation of turbulence-induced vibration. 
Because the appropriate values of the parameters in the equation are not 
easily obtained, this equation has limited practical application. It is difficult 
to accurately predict breakout noise because it may result from high levels 
of transmission noise, flow-generated noise, or duct wall vibration because 
of duct internal sound fields or internal flow turbulence.
Figure 2.4 Primary noise transmission from a fan to a room.38 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
To estimate the levels of breakout noise due to the vibration of the duct 
wall caused by the interaction of the turbulent flow and the in-duct elem￾ents, a prediction method based on the static pressure drops across the 
in-duct elements was proposed [13]. The total sound power levels, Lw,Total , 
of the breakout noise due to sound- and turbulence-induced vibrations can 
be estimated by,

where Lw,A is the radiated sound power level of the breakout noise due to 
sound-induced vibration and Lw,F is the radiated sound power level of the 
breakout noise due to turbulence-induced vibration. Lw,F can be obtained 
using Eq. 2.2, and Lw,D can be calculated using Nelson and Morfey’s 
equations [14] (discussed in Chapter 3).
Noise breakout may be due to (1) high levels of transmission noise; 
(2) flow-generated noise; and (3) turbulent airflow interacting with duct 
walls, causing the duct walls to vibrate and radiate airborne noise.
2.4 SECONDARY NOISE
Extensive research on regenerated noise has been conducted, and has had 
a strong emphasis on jet engine noise. The airflow speeds involved in this 
situation are generally close to the speed of sound. Compared with the 
considerable effort in the jet noise field, little work has been conducted 
on the problem of noise generation by turbulent flow in ventilation duct 
systems.
In the past, some investigators worked on the collection of data 
concerning noise generation using various duct elements. However, they 
worked on a very limited range of duct elements and sizes because of 
the need for expensive acoustic and aerodynamic facilities for conven￾tional measurements. Other researchers have attempted to develop gen￾eral techniques for predicting flow-generated noise in ventilation systems. 
The techniques are based on an empirical relationship between the loss of 
static pressure caused by the in-duct flow elements and the sound power 
generated.
The spectrum of the sound power generated was predicted using a 
generalised spectrum based on a Strouhal number (St), for which it is neces￾sary to identify a representative dimension. The simple spoilers used in the 
experiments of these workers could be accomplished by simple observa￾tion. These techniques were developed from a study of the sound generated Duct-borne sound prediction and control 39
by simple in-duct elements, such as strip spoilers and orifice plates. Real 
in-duct elements, such as bends in ventilation systems, will have very 
dissimilar sizes and shapes compared to these simple in-duct elements. 
Therefore, it is difficult to determine a representative dimension for various 
types and sizes of in-duct elements found in ventilation systems. Unless a 
simple method for determining the representative dimension can be devised, 
a generalised prediction technique for regenerated noise in a ventilation 
system cannot be developed.
As most investigators were unable to determine the overall turbulence 
field in the vicinity of the in-duct elements, they assumed that the fluctu￾ating drag force acting on the flow spoiler was proportional to the steady￾state drag force. Because the sound power level of the regenerated noise 
is determined by the strength of the fluctuating drag force, they assumed 
that the sound power level of the regenerated noise could be related to the 
steady-state drag force. Hence, the sound power level of the regenerated 
noise could be related to the pressure drop across the in-duct elements. 
Nevertheless, the origin of the regenerated noise is the interaction between 
turbulence and in-duct spoilers. It would be preferable if the sound power 
level could be directly related to the turbulence field.
Recently, considerable advances have been made in computational fluid 
dynamics (CFD) such that several commercial codes, which can be used to 
predict the behaviour of moving air, are now available. In principle, these 
CFD codes can be used to determine the fine details of airflow turbulence, 
which can then be used to investigate the noise generated in the ventilation 
system.
There are many potential advantages to using CFD instead of experi￾mental measurements. First, the most important advantage of computer 
simulations is their low cost. Second, computational simulation can usu￾ally be performed with remarkable speed compared to an equivalent real 
experiment. Third, a computer solution to a problem provides a consid￾erable amount of detailed information, but no experimental study can 
be expected to measure the distribution of all variables over the entire 
domain. Fourth, realistic conditions can be simulated in CFD; for example, 
various sizes of in-duct elements and ducts with different airflow rates can 
be modelled.
However, there is a disadvantage to using CFD. The validity of a CFD 
solution depends on both the mathematical model and numerical method 
employed, but the experimental investigation, in contrast, observes reality.
Secondary noise is also called regenerated noise or flow-​generated noise.

noise is presented in Figure 2.5.40 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems

Prediction methods for 
flow-generated noise 
from ventilation systems
3.1 INTRODUCTION
In the previous chapter, we discussed the three types of noise problems com￾monly encountered in ventilation ductwork systems. In this chapter, we 
focus on the development of prediction methods for flow-generated noise 
from ventilation systems. Flow-​generated noise, also known as regenerated 
noise or secondary noise, is the noise generated on the quiet side of pri￾mary attenuators because of the interaction between the turbulent air flow 
and duct discontinuities or flow spoilers, as shown in Figure 3.1. In other 
words, it is the additional noise generated by unsteady flow in the wake of 
an obstruction in a flow duct.
At long distances from a noise source, such as a fan in a flow duct, flow￾generated noise from in-duct elements can be severe. Splitter attenuators or 
dissipative silencers, which are commonly used in ducts to absorb the noise 
produced by ventilation system supply fans, can generate noise as well as 
absorb it. Hence, controlling the flow-generated noise of duct fittings is of 
utmost engineering importance.
If flow-generated noise could be predicted at the design stage, then it 
would not be a problem as a suitable remedy could be prescribed. In fact, 
the failure to accurately predict noise levels, especially in high-speed (i.e., air 
flow velocities above 10 m/s) ventilation flow ducts, can make it impossible 
to solve problems that arise after commissioning because there is usually no 
space available.
Ventilation system designers usually attempt to predict flow-generated 
noise using the procedures set out in publications such as the ASHRAE 
Handbook [1] or CIBSE Guide [2]. The information contained in these 
publications were drawn from the published works of different researchers. 
However, these researchers usually consider a limited range of in-duct 
components and duct sizes. Thus, applying their results to systems with 
configurations considerably different from those on which the original 
measurements were made can produce questionable results. In short, existing 
design methods are inadequate. Willson and Iqbal [3] have claimed that 44 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
the standard techniques for predicting flow-generated noise due to in-duct 
elements, found in the ASHRAE Handbook and CIBSE Guide significantly 
underestimate the noise levels likely to be encountered in practical systems.
3.2 THE CONCEPT OF ‘AERODYNAMIC NOISE’
Because the mechanism of flow-noise generation is directly related to aero￾dynamics, the flow-generated noise from ventilation systems is a form of 
‘aerodynamic noise’. It is therefore important to understand the concept of 
aerodynamic noise and the different types of aerodynamic sound sources 
before the previous work on flow-generated noise is reviewed.
Aerodynamic noise is noise generated as a by-product of an unsteady 
(turbulent) airflow, or noise produced without (vibration) the participation 
of solid boundaries. Its frequency spectrum extends from the sub-audible 
to the ultrasonic, encompassing a wide range of frequencies of comparable 
intensity.
Aerodynamic noise can be produced by air jets, boundary layers, vortices 
and wakes, edge tones, and related phenomena. The theory of aerodynamic 
sound generation was modelled after the stress system in a fluid acting on 
fluid elements. This leads to the condensation and dilation of the fluid elem￾ents, causing them to act as acoustic radiators [4]. Numerous factors con￾tribute to stress, including pressure and velocity field fluctuations, shear 
forces in the flow, fluid viscosity, and external body forces.
As previously stated, aerodynamic noise also comprises ultrasonic noise. 
It cannot be ‘heard’ but could have detrimental effects on human beings or 
animals, and thus require investigation by medical researchers. The discus￾sion here will be restricted to the low flow speeds encountered in ventilation 
systems that result in the generation of low-frequency sound, and for which 
current aerodynamic theory provides three fundamental mechanisms of 
noise generation. Figure 3.2 (after Gordon [5]) shows a schematic represen￾tation of the typical locations and descriptions of the three noise-generation 
mechanisms for a terminal duct carrying air.
Figure 3.1 A schematic of flow-generated noise in a ventilation system.Prediction methods for flow-generated noise 45
3.2.1 Aerodynamic monopole
Aerodynamic monopole radiation occurs when mass or heat is introduced 
into a fluid at a non-steady rate. A monopole source is similar to a pulsating 
sphere (Figure 3.3 after Howe and Baumann [6]). The acoustic pressure￾pulse fronts are always in phase, thereby producing a spherical directivity 
pattern.
When monopole sound is generated by unsteady flow velocities, the 
dimensional relationship between the radiated sound power and important 
parameters that produce it is:
W L U
c monopole ∝ = L U M ρ ρ 2 4
2 3 (3.1)
where
Wmonopole = radiated sound power, W;
ρ = mean gas density, kg/m3;
c = speed of sound in gas, m/s;
U = flow velocity, m/s;
L = length scale; and
M = Mach number which is equal to U/c, dimensionless.
It follows that, for a monopole source, the intensity of sound generation is 
proportional to the fourth power of the mean flow velocity.
Typical monopole sources include pulse jets (where high-speed air is 
periodically ejected through a nozzle), sirens (where a steady airflow is peri￾odically chopped), and propellers at zero pitch (where air is periodically 
displaced each time a blade passes a given point).
In ventilation systems, the necessary perturbation of the net mass flow 
through the duct system, which results in a monopole source, could arise 
Figure 3.2 A schematic of the three noise-generation mechanisms for a terminal duct 
carrying air.46 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
from a fluctuating stall in the air-moving equipment or, less likely, from the 
net compressibility of the duct air flow.
3.2.2 Aerodynamic dipole
When turbulent flow interacts with a solid surface, or when turbulence 
(in the form of a wake) is generated by a solid surface, changes occur in 
the momentum field around the spoiler. Such changes are time-dependent; 
require fluctuating forces; and must, in general, exist on the solid surface. 
Any such forces may be resolved into ‘lift’ and ‘drag’ components, and the 
sound generated is represented by an acoustic dipole (Figure 3.3), the axis 
of which is aligned with that of the fluctuating force. The dipole can be 
considered as two monopoles separated by a small distance and pulsating 
out-of-phase with each other. Most sound generation mechanisms in air￾conditioning systems can be represented by dipole characteristics.
In the flow system shown in Figure 3.1, the presence of the spoiler 
indicates the location of a dipole source. The figure also indicates the possi￾bility that the turbulent wake from the spoiler impinges on the duct wall at 
the exit plane and generates surface noise.
If the dipole-source distribution is random, then the sound spectrum is of 
a broadband nature. A well-ordered distribution, on the other hand, results 
in a discrete sound spectrum. This is what happens with rotational noise 
in fans.
Figure 3.3 Typical sources of aerodynamic noise and their dimensional properties in the 
fluid of uniform mean density.Prediction methods for flow-generated noise 47
The dimensional dependence of the radiated dipole sound power is as 
follows:
W L U
c dipole ∝ = L U M ρ ρ 2 6
3
2 3 3 (3.2)
This indicates that the radiation intensity from the dipoles obeys the sixth 
power of the velocity law. Dipole radiation is a factor of M2, which differs 
from that of a monopole. At subsonic speeds (where M < 1), the dipole is less 
efficient than the monopole. Because of the pressure cancellation that occurs 
in the plane normal to the dipole axis, the contributions yield a directivity 
pattern with a figure-of-eight shape that is strongest in the direction of the 
dipole axis, and weakest at right angles to the axis.
3.2.3 Aerodynamic quadrupole
In airflow systems, turbulent mixing can occur in the absence of solid 
surfaces. Examples of this are found in the induction of airstream mixing 
and boundary layer turbulence. When air leaves the duct, it enters a region 
of zero flow velocity. The high-velocity gradients at the interface of the 
moving and stationary media produce shear forces in the fluids, which gen￾erate turbulent mixing and noise. The noise sources are spatially distributed 
along and across the regions of mixing. Lighthill [7, 8] proposed that a 
quadrupole represents a model of the acoustic source. The quadrupole can 
be considered as a combination of two dipoles aligned in opposite or par￾allel directions, as shown in Figure 3.3.
This is the acoustic quadrupole phenomenon generally referred to as ‘jet’ 
noise. This noise source dominates high-speed subsonic, turbulent air jets. 
The strength of the quadrupole source is large in regions where both turbu￾lence and mean-velocity gradients are high, such as in the highly turbulent 
mixing layer of a jet. Sources of noise generated by turbulence may also be 
found within ducts. These are associated with local high-velocity gradients, 
as in the spoiler wake in Figure 3.3.
The dimensional dependence of radiated quadrupole sound power is as 
follows:
W L U
quadrupole ∝ = L U M ρ ρ 2 8
2 3 3
5 (3.3)
The radiated sound power for this source type is proportional to the eighth 
power of the flow velocity. The quadrupole efficiency differs by factor M2
from that of the dipole. At subsonic speeds (M < 1), the quadrupole radiation 48 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
efficiency is lower than that of the dipole because of the double cancellation 
effect, as shown in the fourth column of Figure 3.3.
3.2.4 Dominant noise sources
The radiation efficiencies of monopole, dipole, and quadrupole sources 
decrease in subsonic flows. However, the dependence of their radiated sound 
powers on flow speeds exhibit the opposite trend, i.e., the total radiated 
sound power varies as the fourth, sixth, and eighth power of the flow speed 
for monopole, dipole, and quadrupole sources, respectively. Thus, despite 
the inherently low efficiency, radiation from a quadrupole source may dom￾inate that from other sources at a high flow speed. The quadrupole radiation 
for a jet engine with a high exhaust speed usually predominates, although 
other internal sources, such as rough burning (predominantly a monopole 
source) or compressor noise (predominantly a dipole source), are present 
and contribute to the total noise.
The constant of proportionality for each type of source may have different 
values depending on the sound generation process. Thus, the constant for a 
singing-wire phenomenon is different from that for an edge-tone phenom￾enon, although both result from aerodynamic dipole radiation. The propor￾tionality relations in Eqs. 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 are useful in estimating the effects 
of parameter changes on the radiated sound power.
3.2.5 Additional ideas on aerodynamic sources
Hardy [9] has shown that by assuming a simple spherical diffusion source, 
it is possible to deal with phenomena such as air outlets under pressure 
(monopoles), fan noise (dipoles), and jet noise (quadrupoles).
By considering the sound radiation from unsteady forces resulting from 
turbulence in the oncoming flow and from the shedding of vortices from a 
flow spoiler, Curle [10] showed that under certain conditions, the applied 
forces on a fluid correspond to acoustic dipoles. Several authors [11, 12] 
have shown that the dipole (surface) sound radiated by an infinite rigid flat 
plate vanishes, and the radiation field degenerates into a quadrupole type. 
In considering a finite plate, however, where the flow extends over the edges, 
the pressure differential across the plate is relieved by the flow around the 
edges, generating a sound similar to that from ‘pressure dipoles’ – a type of 
radiation that cannot exist elsewhere on the plate [13].
The analysis of the noise generated by flow spoilers usually assumes that 
the spoilers are small compared with the sound wavelength at the frequency 
in question. This ensures that the flow field in the neighbourhood of the 
spoiler may be treated as incompressible. Davies and Ffowcs–Williams [14] 
have noted that when a sound source is confined within an infinitely long 
duct with a small diameter compared to the wavelength, the character of the Prediction methods for flow-generated noise 49
problem changes from three- to one-dimensional. This change affects both 
the acoustic impedance of the surroundings and the amount of sound power 
radiated by the source. In addition, the dependence of the sound power on 
the frequency of the source changes by a factor f2.
At low frequencies, the monopole, dipole, and quadrupole sources 
confined in a small-diameter duct would have sound power outputs 
increasing as u2, u4, and u6 instead of the typical u4, u6, and u8 characteristics 
of these sources in an infinite fluid, respectively. As the frequency of the 
sound source increases, the sound power radiated by the source in the duct 
approaches that in the free field.
3.3 PREVIOUS WORKS ON FLOW-GENERATED NOISE 
FROM VENTILATION SYSTEMS
The purpose of this review is to indicate the amount of effort spent so far 
on the measurement and development of prediction techniques for flow￾generated noise.
Several researchers have contributed to the development of prediction 
techniques for flow-generated noise in ventilation systems. Prior to actually 
developing such techniques, some researchers established the theory or basis 
of the mechanism of aerodynamic noise generation [15].
Before 1950, the production of sound by airflow in the presence of rigid 
bodies was of interest, especially in connection with musical instruments. 
Theoretical and experimental investigations of the intensity of the sound 
produced by fluid flow were performed.
It is known that turbulent motion produces noise directly related to the 
fluctuating pressure distribution. In 1950, Batchelor [16] obtained pressure 
correlations by considering the pressure fluctuations caused by the turbulent 
motion of a viscous incompressible fluid; however, he did not consider how 
to estimate the sound generated by turbulence.
In the early 1950s, a new impetus for research on aerodynamic noise was 
provided by the theory of Lighthill [7, 8] which predicted the sound intensity 
produced by fluid motion. This became the classical theory of aerodynamic 
noise generation that describes the mechanism by which the free turbulence 
in the mixing region of a jet exhaust radiates sound. He demonstrated that 
the sound field is produced by the static distribution of acoustic quadrupoles, 
and that the intensity of the noise generated increased according to the 
eighth power of the exhaust velocity. The basis of this approach was the 
comparison with the governing equations of the density fluctuations of real 
fluid, which are appropriate for a uniform acoustic medium at rest. The 
difference between the two sets of equations was considered as the effect of a 
fluctuating external force field (externally applied fluctuating stresses) acting 
on the uniform acoustic medium at rest, hence radiating sound according to 
the ordinary laws of acoustics.50 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
In 1952, Proudman [17] analysed the generation of noise by homoge￾neous isotropic turbulence on the basis of Lighthill’s theory.
In 1955, Curle [10] extended Lighthill’s general theory of aerodynamic 
sound by incorporating the influence of solid boundaries on the sound field. 
First, the reflection and diffraction of sound waves occur at the solid bound￾aries. Second, there is a resultant dipole field at the solid boundaries, which 
are the limits of Lighthill’s quadrupole distribution. These effects are shown 
to be equivalent to a dipole distribution.
In 1963, Powell [18] attempted to describe the aerodynamic sound 
generated by the movement of vortices, or vorticity, in an unsteady fluid 
flow. His theory is particularly well-structured to estimate sound from flows 
described in terms of vorticity.
In 1967, Davies and Ffowcs–Williams [14] addressed the problem of esti￾mating the sound field generated by a limited turbulence region in an infin￾itely long, straight, and hard-walled pipe. The acoustic power in the pipe 
was considered and calculated for two types of turbulent motion. For the 
first type, the eddies large to such an extent that the motion is completely 
correlated across the pipe, and all the sound is in the form of a plane wave 
propagating in the axial direction. The second type of motion is a statistic￾ally slow varying flow with a small eddy correlation length compared with 
the cross-sectional pipe dimension.
After the basis of the aerodynamic sound generation theory was 
established, numerous theoretical and experimental studies were conducted 
on flow-generated noise in ventilation systems. Because flow-generated 
noise can be severe at a high flow velocity, it has gained the interest of many 
scientific and technical investigators. Their experimental work focusing on 
data collection for flow-generated noise will first be reviewed, followed by 
those on the development of generalised predictive techniques for flow￾generated noise.
3.3.1 Work on the collection of measured data for 
various duct elements
Various potential sources of flow-generated noise exist in ventilation duct￾work systems. The following are considered.
Plain straight ducts, bends, take-offs, abrupt and gentle transformation 
pieces, tie rods, butterfly dampers, opposed blade dampers, damper-damper 
interaction, attenuators, terminal units, diffusers and associated dampers, 
grilles, high-speed jet outlets, and nozzles.
3.3.1.1 Straight empty duct
Ingard et al. [19] carried out experiments in which air was passed through 
an empty 600 mm square mild steel duct at velocities of 10, 15, and 25 m/s. Prediction methods for flow-generated noise 51
Their results showed that the generated sound power level increased by 
approximately 18 dB per doubling of the flow speed. The energy in the 
spectrum decreased with the increase in frequency. However, an increase in 
the sound power was observed when the sound wavelength was comparable 
to the duct width.
Soroka [20, 21] investigated circular ducts with diameters between 100 
and 250 mm, and rectangular/square ducts with equivalent cross-sectional 
areas, all open-ended. His results showed systematic relationships between 
the duct velocities and measured sound levels. Circular ducts were observed 
to be quieter than square ducts at lower velocities. Nevertheless, the rate of 
increase of the noise with velocity was higher for circular ducts. Thus, the 
circular ducts were nearly as noisy as the square ducts at the highest veloci￾ties tested. In addition, the rectangular duct was noisier than the square duct 
with the same cross-sectional area.
Soroka also measured the A-weighted sound levels in each case at approxi￾mately 600 mm (2 ft) from the centre of the exit section at an angle of 45°. 
Because only two rectangular ducts were tested, the data for the other duct 
sizes were obtained by extrapolation. Moreover, the analysis ignored the 
noise spectrum, which is important. Therefore, the uncertainty created by 
his approach and the abovementioned omissions have vitiated the authority 
of his work.
3.3.1.2 Butterfly dampers
Ingard et al. [19] measured the spectra of the noise generated by a 597 mm × 
597 mm × 3 mm steel damper installed in a 600 mm square duct at an angle 
of 0°, 15°, and 45° with respect to the flow axis. The flow speeds ranged 
from 4 to 30 m/s in a series of experiments. For small-angle settings, the 
spectrum shape was similar to that of the empty duct spectra. However, the 
spectrum was remarkably flat at the highest angle setting. This change was 
attributed to the increase in the size and velocity of the turbulent wake that 
formed behind the plate as the angle setting of the damper increased.
3.3.1.3 Cylindrical rod in a straight duct
It is common to have a strut or sensor inside a ventilation duct system. 
Ingard et al. [19] tested a series of small-diameter rods in a 600 mm × 
600 mm steel duct. The rods typically did not radiate any noticeable 
noise above the general background noise from the duct. Occasionally, 
however, the sound intensity was considerably amplified when the eddy 
frequency of the Karman vortices shed by the cylinder (Figure 3.4) 
coincided with the frequency of the lateral acoustic wave mode in the 
duct. Their results showed the effects of placing a 13 mm rod in a duct 
flow of 25 m/s. The increased noise from regeneration was preferentially 52 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
amplified by coupling to a resonant mode of the 600 mm square duct at 
500 Hz of noise from a 600 mm × 600 mm duct with and without four 
13 mm diameter rod.
3.3.1.4 Duct transition sections
Ingard et al. [19] measured the sound power generated by three transition 
combinations using abrupt and gradual transformations. They found that a 
higher airflow rate produced a higher sound level. Nevertheless, the sound 
levels produced differed throughout the spectrum on a case-to-case basis. 
Basically, the abrupt transition pieces generated more sound than the gradual 
ones, but the change in the sound level produced had no direct relationship 
with the change in the cross-sectional area. Furthermore, with an area tran￾sition ratio of 3:1, an improvement of only a few decibels was achieved with 
the use of a gradual transition. For the smaller area ratio change of 1.5:1, 
an improvement of approximately 20 dB was achieved. With a large area 
change of 9:1, the results showed improvements approaching 30 dB with 
the use of gradual transition.
3.3.1.5 Bends
Kerka [22] was among the earliest investigators to measure the attenuation 
and noise generation by bends, both with and without turning vanes. He 
found that vaned bends were significantly noisier than unvaned bends. For 
vaned bends of the same size but different angles, the noise levels in the 
low- and mid-frequency range were similar for a given air velocity. The 
noise level at low frequencies for vaned bends of the same angle signifi￾cantly increased as their size increased. For vaned bends of different aspect 
ratios (with opposite sides remaining constant in size), the noise level was 
nearly the same in the mid-frequency range. However, it increased in the 
low-frequency rage, and to a lesser extent in the high-frequency range, as 
the aspect ratio increased.
Figure 3.4 A schematic of the generation of Karman vortices due to a cylindrical rod.Prediction methods for flow-generated noise 53
Ingard et al. [19] also measured the noise generated by bends. Six bends 
were tested during the experiments. Curved and rectangular 90° bends were 
tested with both square and rectangular cross-sections. The rectangular 
bends were tested with and without circular arc-turning vanes. Tests were 
conducted for each bend at various duct air velocities, reaching approxi￾mately 30 m/s with 400 mm square bends and 13 m/s with 600 mm × 
200 mm rectangular bends. They found that the radiused bends generated 
marginal sound for the entire range of air flow rates considered. Therefore, 
this type of bend can generally be ignored as a source of significant aero￾dynamic sound.
Soroka [20, 21] conducted a series of experiments to test 90° sharp and 
radiused bends with and without terminating ducts, fitted to ducts with 
diameters ranging between 100 and 250 mm. He measured the A-weighted 
sound levels at a distance of 600 mm from the centre of the exit and at an 
angle of 45o. In some cases, additional measurements were performed at a 
distance of 900 mm for comparison. His objective was to measure the sound 
power in the direct field of the exit plane. Soroka performed his analysis 
solely on the basis of the total sound power generated; no reference was 
made to the noise spectrum. This approach is misleading, and the results 
lack vital information. Therefore, his conclusions should be interpreted with 
caution.
Watson [23] tested 725 mm × 350 mm and 350 mm × 750 mm lined 
and unlined ducts and bends, with and without airflow. His objective was 
to investigate the attenuation (insertion loss), self-generated noise, and 
pressure drop of different duct elements. Mitre bends without vanes, with 
standard guide vanes, and with acoustically treated guide vanes were tested. 
Watson’s work had a limited scope and was not a systematic investigation. 
However, he observed that when he used specially lined double-skin con￾struction guide vanes, the high-frequency attenuation effect of the vanes was 
significantly modified, and the performance appeared to be close to that of 
bends without vanes. The self-generated noise of the specially treated bends 
appeared comparable with that of any well-designed vaned mitre bend. 
The sound power levels obtained from the tests agreed closely with those 
obtained by Kerka [22] on similar elements.
3.3.1.6 Branch take-off sections
Brockmeyer [24] conducted an experiment to measure the sound power 
leaving the end of a 100 mm branch duct for two main flow velocities (9 
and 18 m/s) and two junction designs (sharp and coned). The experimental 
results considered the duct ‘end reflection’ and indicated a substantial fall￾off below 250 Hz. The term ‘end reflection’ is a phenomenon that occurs 
when the sound energy reaches the end of a duct run. A considerable amount 
of low-frequency energy is reflected upwards through the ductwork. If the 54 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
outlet is small, then the amount reflected could reach 90% or more. This 
occurs because, for low-frequency sound, whose wavelength is significantly 
greater than that of the duct, the noise or pressure fluctuation compresses 
a slug of air in the pipe like a wave. Upon reaching the end of the pipe, the 
slug of air can suddenly expand sideways, and the resistance to the pressure￾pulse motion disappears, which causes a considerable amount of air to exit 
the end of the pipe, and a negative pulse to travel back up the pipe, taking 
some of the energy with it.
3.3.2 Work on generalised predictive technique for 
flow-generated noise
The data obtained from the previous experiments described above can only 
be effectively applied to systems with the same configurations. Moreover, 
only general conclusions can be drawn. As an alternative to the establish￾ment of a database of flow-generated sound powers, because of the variety 
of elements, attempts have been made to develop a more generalised pre￾diction method.
Chaddock [25] experimentally found that the total sound power level in 
decibels WD of circular ceiling diffusers could be expressed by the following 
equation:
WD m A Vm = + 32 13 60 + 10 10 log log (3.4)
where
Am = minimum flow area in the neck, m2 and
Vm = velocity at the minimum area, m/s.
Hubert [26] plotted the total noise output of various diffusers against the 
resistance based on the concept of diffuser resistance, which he previously 
derived [27]. The empirical relationship he obtained is as follows:
WD s = + L A 10 60 30 log l 10 10 10 m m + + og V log , ξ (3.5)
where
WD = sound power level, dB;
Ls = specific sound power level (re 10-12W);
ξ = specific resistance of the diffuser;
Am = minimum flow area in the neck, m2; and
Vm = velocity at the minimum flow area, m/s.
The concept of a pressure-​based scheme to predict the sound generated by 
the interaction between a flow and surface was first proposed by Iudin [28]. 
He began with the assumption that the acoustic power of flow-generated Prediction methods for flow-generated noise 55
noise, and its distribution over the frequency spectrum, are determined by 
the geometric shape of the duct, its dimensions, flow parameters, and the 
acoustic properties of the volume in which the sound was generated. He 
further assumed that the flow parameters in an air duct with a specific geo￾metric shape are determined by the static pressure differential P across it; 
the physical properties of the medium (density ρ and sound velocity c); and 
dimensionless constants (Reynolds number Re and Mach number M).

v = c (3.6)
M V
c = (3.7)
where
V = time-averaged flow velocity at a characteristic point in the air duct;
dc = determined geometric dimension (representative dimension); and
ν = kinematic viscosity of the medium.
According to Iudin, the acoustic properties of the volume are determined 
by the dimensionless impedances Z of the boundaries, and by the relationship 
between the sound wavelength and dimensions of the volume λ/dc. The fre￾quency of the aerodynamic sound is determined by the Strouhal number St.
St fd
V = = Q R 1 ( ) the geometric shape, e M, (3.8)
Because the frequency is f = c/λ, then λ/dc = 1/(MSt); therefore, λ/dc, which is 
a constant when Z is also a constant, is not a determining criterion.
Based on these assumptions, the acoustic power of the air duct can be 
expressed as follows:
W Q p c d Re M Z
d = 


This equation is the working similarity formula for his experiments.
Iudin studied the noise of various metal air duct elements, including low￾and high-pressure ejectors, powdery granular material layers, and aero￾dynamic velocity pipes. The investigations were performed in both acoustic 56 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
and untreated rooms and in open air. By combining the results of his studies 
with a dimensional analysis of the source mechanism, he concluded that the 
acoustic power is proportional to the cube of the excess pressure and the 
square of the geometric dimension.
Iudin’s work has been relatively neglected in favour of the work of 
Gordon [29, 30]. Initially, Gordon and Maidanik [31] studied the sound￾generating capabilities of a flow spoiler in a pipe environment using a scale 
model. Their investigation of the effect of upstream flow discontinuities on 
the acoustic power radiated by an air jet was expanded by Gordon [29, 30]. 
The analysis by Gordon was based on the assumption that the magnitude of 
the fluctuating forces associated with an aerodynamic source is proportional 
to the steady-state drag forces. He investigated the sound power generated 
by various spoilers close to the end of a pipe carrying a high-velocity air 
flow. He [29] initially derived the following empirical formula to predict the 
total acoustic power generated by a spoiler in a duct.

where
W = acoustic power;
p0 = total stagnation pressure on the upstream side of the spoiler (measured 
with a pitot static tube);
pa = atmospheric pressure;
ρa
 = atmospheric density;
ca = velocity of sound;
D = duct diameter; and
K = constant with an experimentally determined value of 2.5 × 10-4.
The geometry of the spoiler was not directly input into Eq. (3.11) but was 
implicit in the pressure drop (p0 − pa) across the flow spoiler.
The frequency spectrum of the flow-generated noise is crucial in engin￾eering design. Gordon found that a normalised spectrum could be obtained 
by collapsing the data from a series of experiments onto different spoiler 
configurations. He then modified Eq. (3.11) into the following form:

where
f0 = constant frequency related to the dimension of the duct spoiler system;
fc = octave band centre frequency; and
D = duct diameter.Prediction methods for flow-generated noise 57
He observed that f0 tended to be close to the cross-mode onset frequency, 
and collapsed his data based on this correction.
Gordon considered air velocities and pressure drops across spoilers in 
excess of those encountered in ventilation systems. Although his work 
cannot be applied to predict flow-generated noise in ventilation systems, 
his work along with that of Iudin, support the idea that a pressure-based 
prediction technique may be applicable to conditions encountered in 
ventilation systems. Although he devised scaling laws to collapse his 
measured sound power data onto a ‘generalised spectrum’, he derived 
his scaling laws from a free-field radiation model, in which the noise was 
generated by a point fluctuating source and the effect of the duct was 
neglected.
In 1970, Heller and Widnall [32] presented the results of their theoretical 
and experimental study on the correlation between fluctuating forces on rigid 
flow spoilers with the corresponding sound radiation. As an extension of the 
experimental work of Gordon and Maidanik [31], they directly measured 
the fluctuating drag and lift forces on flow spoilers. They then demonstrated 
a direct correlation between the fluctuating forces and radiated sound under 
both free-field and confined-environment conditions. Their data correlated 
well when they plotted [20log10(Fdrag/F0) − 40log10(U/U0)] and [20log10(P/P0) 
− 60log10(U/U0)] against the Strouhal number St = fcd/U [32, 33]. Fdrag is the 
measured fluctuating drag force (N), F0 is the reference force (1 × 10-5 N), 
U is either the jet exhaust velocity or in-pipe flow velocity (m/s), U0 is the 
reference velocity (1 m/s), fc is the 1/3 octave band centre frequency, d is the 
length dimension related to a typical dimension of the spoiler, P is the sound 
pressure, and P0 is the reference pressure.
A theory, which considers the effects of the enclosure on the sources 
and the pipe-end reflection, was developed to predict the sound power 
radiated to the free field from pipe-immersed flow spoilers. In this theory, 
the efficiency of the sound power radiation from dipole sources in a hard￾walled pipe (confined environment) increased by a frequency-squared term, 
which changed the sound power/flow velocity dependence to a quadrupole 
dependence, i.e., to an eighth-power-law dependence. However, the effect of 
end reflection introduced an inverse frequency-squared term that restored 
the original sixth power of the velocity-dependence of the dipole-source 
power radiation. In addition, the sound power radiated by dipole sources 
in a confined environment increased by a factor of three, as predicted and 
observed in their experiments. Hence, they clarified the acoustical signifi￾cance of the duct enclosing the noise source.
In 1973, Holmes [34, 35] extended Gordon’s work to develop a tech￾nique that became the basis of a flow-generated noise prediction method 
owing to the variety of in-duct elements. He investigated the noise 
generated by supply grilles, dampers, grille and damper combinations, and 
bends fitted with turning vanes. He considered the effect of the ductwork 58 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
enclosing an airstream. He assumed that the acoustic power generated 
was proportional to the product of the area and the sixth power of the 
air velocity. The general technique obtained the effective blockage factor 
Be (ratio of the free area and duct area) from the pressure loss data CL. 
This value was then used to calculate the free area and velocity. Finally, 
the general spectra were employed to obtain the frequency spectrum for a 
given condition.
The relationships proposed for the sound produced by air duct elements 
are as follows.
Damper:
L K w l = + K K V B + + K d s
, 1 Bref 0−12W (3.13)
where
Kl
 = general damper spectrum;
KV = velocity correction factor;
KB = duct correction factor; and
KS = spectrum correction factor.
Similar calculations were performed for grilles and bends with turning vanes 
using the appropriate charts and tables.
This prediction method was developed from a simplified theory and a 
limited range of in-duct components and duct sizes; hence, it may not be 
applicable to systems with different configurations.
Nelson and Morfey [36] investigated the aerodynamic sound production 
in low-speed flow ducts. In developing their theory, they considered the 
effect of the duct environment on noise generation. The basis of their theory 
is that the sound power radiated by an in-duct spoiler is related to the total 
fluctuating drag force acting on the spoiler, which is a function of the tur￾bulence intensity in the spoiler region. Because they were unable to deter￾mine the actual spectrum of the turbulence intensity within the vicinity 
of the spoiler, to arrive at a predictive technique, they further assumed that 
the fluctuating drag force is directly proportional to the steady drag force. 
(The same assumption was made by Gordon [30] in devising his theory, 
and its validity was confirmed by the experiments of Heller and Widnall 
[32].) The collapse of the experimental data onto a generalised spectrum 
to form the basis of the predictive technique was achieved by the empirical 
evaluation of the constant of proportionality between the fluctuating and 
steady drag forces as a function of the Strouhal number.
The Nelson–Morfey equations for determining the sound power generated 
by an in-duct spoiler are as follows.

All the terms in the proposed predictive equations are constants or meas￾urable variables, plus a single Strouhal number-dependent constant. When 
the value of the Strouhal number-dependent constant is established, it is 
possible, in principle, to employ the Nelson–Morfey theory for predictive 
purposes.
The experimental results presented by Nelson and Morfey were obtained 
using simple flat-plate flow spoilers in square-section ductwork. These 
cannot easily be related to typical elements found in real ventilation systems. 
With this type of spoiler, the value of the characteristic dimension can 
be easily determined. To apply the Nelson–Morfey theory to other duct 60 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
obstructions, the appropriate values of this parameter must be determined. 
For obstructions other than flat-plate spoilers in a square duct or for any 
obstruction in a circular duct, the values of this parameter cannot be 
determined by simply inspecting the geometry of the situation.
Oldham and Ukpoho [37] extended the work of Nelson and Morfey to 
the case of circular ductwork and more complex flow spoilers. They rewrote 
the Nelson–Morfey equations by determining the appropriate values of the 
open area ratio and the characteristic dimension to apply the work of Nelson 
and Morfey to more complex flow spoilers in circular or square ducts.
The modified Nelson–Morfey equations by Oldham and Ukpoho for 
determining the sound power generated by an in-duct spoiler are as follows:

Oldham and Ukpoho conducted experiments on dampers and orifice plates 
in a circular duct to produce a generalised spectrum by collapsing the experi￾mental data on the basis of the modified Nelson–Morfey equations. The 
spectra obtained using dampers and orifice plates as spoilers were similar to 
those obtained by Nelson and Morfey with simple strip spoilers. Although 
the results of Oldham and Ukpoho lend further support to the concept of 
a generalised prediction method based on pressure loss, their experiments 
were carried out using ductwork of a similar size to that of Nelson and 
Morfey. Thus, the generalised prediction curve they derived may not apply 
to systems with very different duct dimensions.
Oldham and Ukpoho [38] also investigated the interactions between 
closely spaced duct elements. Their experimental data showed that placing a 
second element in the downstream turbulence of another element increased 
the noise levels experienced with both elements in relative isolation. They 
also found that the increase in noise level was frequency-dependent and 
a function of the spoiler separation and duct diameter. The former effect 
resulted from the acoustic reflection between the two elements, which is 
a function of their acoustic impedances. Despite their studies on the inter￾action between two closely spaced duct elements, their modified Nelson–
Morfey predictive equations are similar to those from previous techniques, 
and are only applicable to an isolated element in air ducts.
Most predictive methods, including those in the CIBSE Guide [2] are 
only applied to an isolated in-duct element, which is very different from 
that found in practical systems. Mak and Yang [39, 40] developed a pre￾dictive technique for the aerodynamic noise radiated by two elements in air 
ducts. To develop their theory, they used a simple source model to represent 
the partially coherent noise sources. Then, they also hypothesised a con￾stant of proportionality between the fluctuating and steady-state drag forces 
acting on the flow spoilers. Based on the work of Nelson and Morfey, Mak 
and Yang finally developed a predictive technique for the flow-generated 
noise produced by two in-duct flow spoilers. Thus, the inferred infinite-duct 
values of the radiated sound power level Lw,D in the frequency band can be 
normalised by evaluating the following:62 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems

These predictive equations were later revised [41] to compare their results 
with the experimental results of Oldham and Ukpoho. The predicted 
results generally agreed with the experimental results of Oldham and 
Ukpoho.
However, the technique proposed by Mak and Yang is limited to two 
in-duct elements. Because there are always multiple in-duct elements (more 
than two elements) in a practical ventilation ductwork system, the technique 
was further developed theoretically by Mak [42] and Mak et al. [43, 44] 
to predict the flow-generated noise produced by multiple in-duct elements. 
These methods consider the acoustical and/or aerodynamic interaction(s) of 
multiple flow-noise sources in an air duct. Mak et al. [45] experimentally 
confirmed the effectiveness of the prediction method of Mak [42] for mul￾tiple in-duct spoilers. Two predictive equations [42, 45] were obtained to 
determine the radiated sound power generated by the interaction between 
multiple spoilers, one corresponding to the centre; frequenciesf

then a simple relationship betweenΠN , the sound power due to multiple (N)

The main drawback of such a prediction method for multiple in-duct 
elements is that it requires the ratio of the mean drag forces, phase relation￾ship between the fluctuating drag forces acting on the spoilers, and coher￾ence function of the noise sources. Determining these parameters requires 
expensive acoustic and aerodynamic facilities.
In this chapter, we mentioned that there is only a limited amount of 
measured data on the flow-generated noise produced by some in-duct 
elements, such as bends and transition pieces. This lack of data reflects Prediction methods for flow-generated noise 67
the difficulty in obtaining such information by conventional measurement 
techniques that require the use of an expensive and specially combined 
acoustic and aerodynamic experimental facility consisting of the following:
1. a powerful fan system;
2. a high-performance silencer system to reduce the noise from the fan 
entering the test section of the ductwork;
3. a long test duct to ensure stable flow conditions at the test element;
4. a large reverberant room with a low level of background noise in which 
the sound power generated can be measured. Examples include the 
experimental setup of Nelson and Morfey [36], Oldham and Ukpoho 
[37], and Mak et al. [44] (Figure 3.5). Other researchers have used a 
large anechoic chamber for acoustic measurements [5, 29].
An alternative to using specialised and aerodynamic facilities currently 
gaining support in building engineering is using computational fluid 
Figure 3.5 Schematic diagrams of the experimental setup for flow-generated noise

dynamics (CFD) software packages, which is a powerful design tool that 
can predict the behaviour of fluid flow regimes. It has been applied to sev￾eral areas of building engineering with considerable success, such as smoke 
extraction. The use of the pressure drop across in-duct elements to predict 
the sound power level of flow-generated noise is attributed to the fact that 
investigators have been unable to determine the actual spectrum of the tur￾bulence intensity within the vicinity of a spoiler. However, flow-generated 
noise originates from the turbulence itself and its interaction with an acous￾tically hard surface. The use of CFD enables the direct determination of 
the turbulent field within the vicinity of the spoiler. Therefore, the validity 
of the basic assumption regarding the constant of proportionality between 
fluctuating and steady drag forces, which is the basis of pressure-based 
techniques, can be investigated. A representative dimension for dissimilar 
in-duct elements can also be obtained by studying the turbulent field within 
the vicinity of the in-duct elements. In addition, a relationship between tur￾bulence and acoustic energy can be established to develop a generalised pre￾dictive technique for flow-generated noise. CFD was employed by Mak and 
Oldham [46, 47] to develop their technique for predicting flow-generated 
noise in ventilation systems. This technique is based on the relationship 
between the turbulent kinetic energy and acoustic energy. Although they 
have developed a turbulence-based prediction technique for flow-generated 
noise, their technique, similar to that of other researchers, can only be used 
for an isolated element in an air duct. In a real system, acoustic and aero￾dynamic interactions always occur between nearby elements in an air duct.
To further develop the prediction methods of Mak et al. for practical 
applications, a CFD approach [48, 49] was adopted to determine the 
parameters of the prediction methods, such as the ratio of the mean drag 
forces, the phase relationship between the fluctuating drag forces acting on 
the spoilers, and the coherence function of the noise sources.
Bullock [50] transformed the test data obtained by Ingard et al. [19] into 
a more general and useful form. The results of his analytical work have been 
adopted by ASHRAE Handbook [1] for the estimation of flow-generated 
noise by an isolated air duct element.
The CIBSE Guide B4 Noise and Vibration Control for HVAC [2] 
proposed an equation (CIBSE Guide B4 method) to estimate the overall 
sound power level Lw generated by an isolated duct fitting:
L C A u w = + 10 60 + 10 10 log log (3.30)
where
C = a constant dependent on the fitting and flow turbulence;
A = minimum flow area of the fitting, m2; and
u = maximum flow velocity in the fitting, m/s.Prediction methods for flow-generated noise 69
Typical values of C for a range of duct fittings in low-turbulence flow 
conditions and the corrections to obtain the octave band power levels are 
provided in CIBSE Guide B4.
In addition to the CIBSE Guide B4 method, the Guide provides a gen￾eric formula based on the concept of the pressure-​based scheme and the 
works of Nelson and Morfey, and Oldham and Ukpoho for predicting 
flow-generated noise produced by an isolated duct fitting. Two predictive 
equations for the flow-generated noise produced by a single isolated in-duct 
spoiler are used to obtain the sound power level LW in different frequency 
ranges (below and above the ‘cut-on’ frequency f
0 of the duct). The cut￾on frequency f
0, which was determined by the geometries of the duct as 
f c l 0 = /2 for rectangular ductwork or f c r 0 = 1. / 841 2π for circular ductwork 
(where c is the velocity of sound, l is the longest sectional dimension of the 
rectangular ductwork, and r is the radius of the circular duct), determines 
the wave propagation modes through the duct. According to CIBSE Guide 
B4, the equations for the sound power level LW are given as [2]:
For f f c < 0 (below the cut-on frequency)
L K St A u w = −37 20 20 10 40 + ( ) ( ) + + + 10 10 10 10 log log ξ log log (3.31)

σ = − ( ) ξ ξ( ) − 1 2 1 1 / is the clear area ratio, and K St ( ) is an experimentally
determined factor related to the Strouhal number St af u = − ( ) c
σ σ 1 / (a

20 10 log K( ) ( ) St can be obtained once the Strouhal number is derived. The 
pressure loss factor ξ can be obtained from the expression ξ ρ = ∆P u /0 5 2 .
(where ∆P is the static pressure drop due to the component, and ρ is the 
density of air).
The flow-generated noise problem caused by in-duct elements is due to the 
complex acoustic and turbulent interactions between multiple in-duct flow 
noise sources. The prediction method of Mak et al. [42, 45] for multiple in￾duct elements considered the effects of interactions between flow-generated 
noise sources in ventilation ductworks by introducing an interaction factor 
in the predictive equations in Eq. (3.25). This interaction factor, denoted as 
β m, was later introduced [51] to revise the generic formula in CIBSE Guide 70 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
B4 to develop a simplified and practical engineering prediction method for 
multiple in-duct elements. This simplified method is explained as follows.
The sound power generated by a single in-duct element can be obtained 
by Eq. (3.31) (for f f c < 0) and Eq. (3.32) (for f f c > 0) in different frequency 
ranges. For the sound power generated by multiple in-duct elements, a 
simple relationship between the sound power level owing to multiple elem￾ents and that owing to a single element is obtained as follows:
L L WN w N = + 10 10 log , β (3.33)
where LWN and LW represent the sound power level owing to multiple and a 
single element (obtained from Eq. (3.31) and Eq. (3.32)), respectively; and 
β mN is the interaction factor. Notably, LW is the element with the largest 
pressure loss factor ξ. Based on the earlier works of Mak et al. [42, 45], the 
simplified equations of the interaction factor are expressed as follows:
For f f c < 0 (below the cut-on frequency)

number, L is the shortest distance between two elements, a and b are the 
duct cross-sectional dimensions, and r is the radius of the circular duct.
The interaction factor ꞵN is primarily a function of the frequency, dis￾tance between the various duct elements, and geometries of the ventilation 
ductwork system. It can be observed from Eq. (3.33) that the LWN increased 
when the interaction factor ꞵN > 1, and decreased when 0 < ꞵN < 1. However, 
Eq. (3.35) only considers the case of ꞵN > 1 by removing the product term 
cos( ) kL kL − u c/ from the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.35). 
The purpose of such simplification is to prevent underestimations at high 
frequencies. The values of the interaction factor could be obtained in a 
straightforward manner at the design stage once the geometries of the ven￾tilation ductwork system have been determined. Although the proposed 
interaction factor ꞵN only represents the approximate added sound pressure 
level, and hence could overestimate it, the simple and convenient prediction 
formulae meet the requirements of engineers dealing with daily practical 
cases, and could be a significant improvement to existing design guides. The 
predictions of this proposed method show good agreement with the experi￾mental results, especially for cases with three in-duct elements [51].
3.4 SUMMARY
Flow-generated noise is aerodynamic noise produced by in-duct elements on 
the quiet side of the primary attenuator in a ventilation system. The accurate 
prediction and control of flow-generated noise are important because, at 
long distances from the primary noise source (the fan), such noise from duct 
fittings could present severe problems.
This chapter reviewed studies on the measurement and prediction of flow￾generated noise, particularly the prediction methods for flow-generated 
noise produced by in-duct discontinuities. To provide a basis for developing 
a generalised prediction method for the noise produced by all flow duct 
discontinuities in ventilation ductwork systems, several issues need to be 72 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
addressed. (1) To accurately predict the flow-generated noise, the predic￾tion method should consider the acoustics and aerodynamic interactions 
between flow duct elements. (2) To derive a generalised prediction tech￾nique, all of the data for a particular in-duct element or several similar elem￾ents must be collapsed onto a single curve. For different in-duct elements, 
a single normalised spectrum for flow-generated noise may be insufficient 
for all the configurations of in-duct elements. It is suggested that several 
representative normalised spectra should be obtained for different types of 
in-duct elements. (3) A simple method to determine the representative char￾acteristic dimension of different flow discontinuities or in-duct elements is 
required to obtain the Strouhal number. In conclusion, it remains to be seen 
whether the developed prediction methods can be applied or extended to 
a wider configuration of obstructions in air duct systems. Some practical 
problems will be encountered in the prediction of flow-generated noise.
Assessing the effects of duct-borne sound and flow-generated noise on 
people is as important as their prediction. In Chapter 5, we will discuss 
the recent development of a holistic psychoacoustic assessment method for 
noise from ventilation systems.

Assessment of vibration 
isolation for machinery 
of ventilation systems
4.1 INTRODUCTION
Despite their benefits, ventilation ductwork systems produce airborne, 
duct-borne, and structure-borne sounds. Sounds are generated because 
the systems have vibrating mechanical machines, such as ventilation fans 
and motor-driven equipment. These machines may cause the roof or floor 
of the electrical and mechanical (E&M) equipment room to vibrate suffi￾ciently high, rendering the spaces they serve unusable. Thus, satisfactory 
acoustic design plays an important role in the design of ventilation systems.
Building acoustics is focused on the audio frequency range (or audible 
frequency range) 20–20 kHz as well as the octave or 1/3 octave scale 
and Bark scale for the frequency analysis in acoustic and psychoacoustic 
measurements, respectively. However, vibration or structure-borne sound 
analyses are typically centred on low frequencies (e.g., 0–200 Hz). This 
range includes frequencies from 20 to 200 Hz that humans may be able 
to hear and vibrations below 20 Hz that can be felt but are inaudible. 
The human perception of vibration and sound differs because our senses 
include hearing and touch. In addition, vibrations or structure-borne 
sound problems are typically analysed in a single-hertz band instead of the 
octave or 1/3 octave band.
Figure 4.1 shows a schematic of a simple vibratory system for modelling 
a machine resting on a floor/roof. It includes a simple vibration isolator 
in relation to a vibrating source, structure-borne sound transmission path, 
and receiver. It also demonstrates several important aspects in the study of 
structure-borne sound transmission in buildings such as:
• Structure-borne sound source characterisation,
• Vibration isolation (assessment of performance using transmissibility),
• Vibrational waves produced in the floor/roof, and
• Coupling with air at the hearing end.78 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
This chapter focuses on vibration isolation. First, the fundamentals of vibra￾tion and some terminologies are introduced in relation to source character￾isation and vibration isolation.
4.2 FUNDAMENTALS OF VIBRATION
Vibrations can be classified as periodic, random, or transient. In periodic 
vibrations, motion is exactly repeated after a time interval called period. 
The simplest type of periodic vibration, called simple harmonic motion, can 
be presented as a displacement–time (x–t) graph or sine wave. This type 
of motion can be described in terms of a single frequency f. In random 
vibrations, oscillations are never exactly repeated. An example is the vibra￾tion produced by wind in building structures. Transient vibrations diminish 
to zero after a certain period. An example is the vibration in buildings 
generated by heavy vehicle passage.
4.2.1 Simple oscillator (free undamped vibration)
When mass m, fastened to a spring and constrained to move parallel to the 
spring, is slightly displaced from its rest position and released, the mass 
vibrates (Figure 4.2). The sinusoidal vibrations of this mass are known as 
simple harmonic vibrations.

stiffness k with a single contact point on a floor.Assessment of vibration isolation for machinery 79
As shown in Figure 4.2, the restoring force, F, can be given by:
F k = − x, (4.1)

4.2.3 Damped oscillations (free vibration)
Whenever a real body oscillates, dissipative (frictional) forces are generated. 
These forces are of many types, depending on the oscillating system. 
However, they consistently result in the damping of oscillations—a decrease 
in the amplitude of free oscillations with time (Figure 4.3(b)).
Consider the viscous frictional force, Fr, on a simple oscillator. Such a 
force is assumed to be proportional to the speed of mass and directed to 
oppose the motion. It can be expressed as
F R dx
dt r m = − , (4.8)
where Rm is a positive constant known as the mechanical resistance of the 
system. In this case of viscous damping, the amount of damping is quanti￾fied using the damping constant, Rm. This is infrequently denoted by another 
symbol, C, defined as the damping force per unit velocity.

4.3 SOURCE CHARACTERISATION
4.3.1 Introduction
Structure-borne sound problems in buildings are more difficult to solve than 
airborne or duct-borne sound problems. One reason is that no consensus 
on how these machines can be described as vibrational sources has been 
achieved. Several studies have demonstrated [1–5] that the activities and 
dynamic characteristics of a machine are both required to describe appro￾priately the ability of a vibrating source to emit structure-borne sound.
This section briefly introduces some basic terminologies and methods for 
characterising the source and receiver for evaluating power transmission.
4.3.2 Basic theory
4.3.2.1 Mobility
The behaviour of most structures in buildings is essentially linear. This allows 
their dynamic response to be described by two basic parameters: exciting 
force and response velocity.
In mechanical vibrations, the complex ratio of the translational or rota￾tional response velocity taken at a point in a system to the exciting force or 
moment phasor at the same point or another point in a system is defined 
as mobility. During excitation, all other points in the structure are allowed 
to respond freely without any constraint other than those representing the 
normal support of the structure. Following the foregoing general definition, 
other terms, such as point, transfer, and cross mobilities designating a loca￾tion and direction with respect to two phasors, can also be defined [1–5].Assessment of vibration isolation for machinery 83
Mobility is frequency-dependent. It is a function of structural geom￾etry, boundary conditions, material properties, and damping. Analytical 
expressions for beams and infinite plates are available; however, publications 
on plate structures with finite boundaries are limited.
4.3.2.2 Free velocity
Machines, such as fans, generate vibrations during operation owing 
to internal dynamic forces. These forces are difficult to measure directly 
because a machine may have multiple vibration-generating components. 
The most practical way to describe the strength of a vibration source is to 
adopt a collective response approach. In this method, the complex source 
mechanism and internal transmission paths are represented by free veloci￾ties at contact points.
Free velocity (the velocity of a source at a contact point) is measured 
while the machine operates without contact with supporting structures.
4.3.2.3 Vibrational power transmission
For a vertical motion system with a single contact point, assuming harmonic 
time dependence, the complex time-averaged power can be expressed as [6]:
P F v, * = 1
2 (4.14)
where F and v are the force and velocity at the contact point, respectively; 
the asterisk denotes a complex conjugate.
The power transmitted, expressed in terms of the source and receiver 
properties, can be expressed as [7]:
P
v
Y Y
Y sf
s r
r = ( ),
+
1
2
2
2 Re (4.15)
where vsf is the root mean square free velocity of the source, and the com￾plex source and receiver mobilities are Ys and Yr, respectively.
4.3.2.4 Source descriptor
Mondot and Petersson [7] proposed a novel characterisation of structure￾borne sound sources in terms of a source descriptor describing the internal 
activity and dynamic characteristics of a source using the free velocity 
and mobility at contact points. By introducing Ys
* (complex conjugate 
of source mobility) into the numerator and denominator of Eq. 4.15, the 84 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
structure-borne sound source can be characterised. Accordingly, the com￾plex power is given by

, called the source descriptor, is solely a function of 
the sound source. Although its dimension is that of power, it is not actual 
power; it represents the ability of the source to deliver power. The actual 
power transmitted is a fraction of this source descriptor. It is determined 
by the second term, the coupling function, which is the degree of matching 
between the source and receiver. The source descriptor data can be obtained 
prior to installation; thus, this unique and invariant quantity is suitable for 
characterising the sound source based on unifying power. This concept was 
subsequently extended to studies of multipoint and multicomponent sources 
[2, 5] using effective mobility [8].
4.3.3 Summary
To evaluate the structure-borne sound transmission from a machine to 
its supporting structure, characterising the structure-borne sound source 
is necessary. One proposed method for source characterisation requires 
three basic parameters: free velocity, source mobility, and supporting struc￾ture mobility. The use of a single parameter is insufficient for properly 
characterising the source or predicting the energy flow under the installation 
condition of the machine.
4.4 VIBRATION ISOLATION
4.4.1 Introduction
Air-cooled chillers, chilled water pumps, and primary air handling units are 
typically installed on the E&M roof or floor of a building. The ASHRAE 
Handbook [9] recommends that a noise-sensitive area must not be near 
or adjacent to E&M plant rooms. However, for noise-sensitive rooms 
(e.g., penthouse-type executive offices) not to be near or directly under 
the E&M floor on which air conditioning equipment (including air-cooled 
chillers or ventilation fans) is installed is unavoidable. Structure-borne 
sound problems are caused by machine vibrations. Although solving this 
problem is important, no simple or universally agreed upon method for 
characterising the ‘noisiness’ of equipment (such as compressors as a source Assessment of vibration isolation for machinery 85
of structure-borne sound) has been devised [1–5]. Several investigators 
[8, 10, 11] have endeavoured to devise techniques for predicting the 
occurrence of structure-borne sound. Nevertheless, no practical method has 
been developed for engineers to predict the level of structure-borne sound 
generated by machinery in occupied spaces. However, structure-borne sound 
can be reduced by installing vibration isolators. The selection of vibration 
isolators is based on the disturbance frequency, which is typically relatively 
low. Force transmissibility or isolation efficiency is generally adopted in the 
industry as a basis for selecting vibration isolators. In defining force trans￾missibility, the floor is assumed as non-movable (i.e., the floor mobility is 
zero). This means that the effect of floor mobility on isolation efficiency 
is generally ignored. In some cases where floor mobility was ignored, no 
structure-borne sound problems occurred. However, in certain cases, a con￾siderable amount of vibrational energy was possibly transmitted to the floor. 
Consequently, vibrations were generated on the E&M floor and emitted 
noise to the room just below the floor. This possibly occurred because the 
effect of floor mobility was ignored in the usual force transmissibility and 
selection of vibration isolators. The effect of floor mobility on the isolation 
efficiency of vibration isolators, recently studied by Mak and Su [12], is 
introduced in this section.
4.4.2 Force transmissibility and isolation efficiency
4.4.2.1 Usual engineering definition of isolation efficiency and 
transmissibility
Machine vibrations are complicated. In practice, a simple single-degree-of￾freedom undamped system with a mass and spring isolator is considered. 
By referring to Figure 4.4, the (force) transmissibility [13] for an undamped 
system can be defined as follows:

δst = static deflection in metre = mg/kx;
δ= static deflection in millimetre = δst ×103
(usually given in the manufacturer’s catalogue);
k = axial stiffness of the spring;
g = acceleration due to gravity; and
m = effective mass of the simple vibration isolation model.
In this formula, the floor is assumed to be non-movable.
Figure 4.5 shows a plot of the usual engineering transmissibility against 
fd/fn for a single degree-of-freedom undamped system. The figure indicates 
that (1) when fd > 2 fn, the transmissibility is less than unity, and useful 
isolation commences. (2) When fd < 2 fn, force amplification occurs. 
(3) The higher the fd value, or the lower the fn value, the greater the 
degree of isolation. (4) When fd = fn, T→∞; however, this does not occur 
in practice because of the presence of damping or mechanical restraints/
constraints within the system. In the foregoing (where the disturbance 
Figure 4.4 A vibration isolation model.Assessment of vibration isolation for machinery 87
frequency equals the natural frequency), the situation is known as ‘reson￾ance condition’.
4.4.2.2 General practice in selecting vibration isolators
Various types of vibration isolators are shown in Figure 4.6. Ventilation 
system designers select the equipment based on various design criteria. From 
the manufacturer’s catalogue the net weight (in kilogram) of a machine can 
be obtained. Typically, designers add approximately 20% to this weight as a 
safety factor. Based on the manufacturer’s catalogue, a suitable static deflec￾tion of a vibration isolator can be selected by the contractor according to the 
weight of the machine provided by the consultant. The natural frequency 
can then be calculated from the static deflection (in millimetres) according 
to the usual definition of the natural frequency given by Eq. 4.19. Based on 
the calculated natural and disturbance frequencies, the isolation efficiency 
can be calculated and verified according to the typical definition given by 
Eqs. 4.16 and 4.17. The isolation efficiency is expected to exceed 90% (fd/
fn > 3.3). The general rule in practice is that the greater the static deflection 
(δ), the lower the natural frequency (fn) of the system. This results in the 
Figure 4.5 Usual engineering transmissibility curve for an undamped system.88 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
greater isolation efficiency of the spectrum of disturbing frequencies (fd) in 
which isolation occurs.
Two types of vibration isolators are commonly used in Hong Kong.
1. Spring isolator (δ > 25 mm)
This isolator typically has high static deflection such that it provides sat￾isfactory vibration isolation even at a low disturbance frequency. At high 
disturbance frequencies, a bridging effect may occur and can be eliminated 
by incorporating a neoprene pad on the base plate. Typically, the installa￾tion cost is high.
2. Rubber (neoprene) (δ < 12 mm)
The use of this rubber to isolate high disturbance frequencies is effective 
because of its high natural frequency. However, performance is degraded 
after the long exposure of rubber to sunlight. This isolator only requires 
simple installation and is typically inexpensive.
In theory, the ratio of the forcing frequency to the natural frequency 
(fd/fn) must be as large as possible provided that it is compatible with the 
stability. A vibratory machine can be rigidly mounted onto an inertia 
block (a large concrete block) and separated by vibration isolators. 
This allows the stiffer isolators to achieve the same natural frequency. 
In addition, the assembly’s centre of gravity was lowered, and the sta￾bility improved. A study on the effect of the inertia block on the stability 
of the vibratory system and performance of vibration isolation can be 
found in [14].
4.4.2.3 Real isolation efficiency and transmissibility
Different from their usual definitions, transmissibility and isolation effi￾ciency were described by Mak and Su [12] by considering the effect of floor 
mobility. For the four identical simple isolators with four contact points

symmetric about the central point of a plate, as shown in Figure 4.7, ‘real’ 
transmissibility (referred to as ‘real’ here because the exhibited transmis￾sibility is believed to reflect reality) is expressed by the following [12]:

is transformed into the usual definition of transmissibility (i.e., Eq. 4.17).

4.4.2.4 Comparison between ‘usual’ and ‘real’ transmissibilities
A vibratory machine placed on a floor is modelled in Figure 4.7. Four simple 
symmetric isolators (each with simple mass (m) and spring stiffness (k)) are 
placed symmetrically on a simple concrete plate. The physical parameters 
of the plate are density (ρ= 2.8 × 103 kg/m3), Young’s modulus (E = 2.1 × 
1010 N/m2), loss factor (η= 0.5 × 10−2), and Poisson’s Ratio (μ = 0.2). The 
geometric dimensions of the plate are as follows: (length) l = 3.5 m, (width) 
W = 3.5 m, and (thickness) d = 0.24 m.
The floor mobility, Y, of the contact point can then be obtained, as 
shown in Figure 4.8a. If the mass, m, is 400 kg and the disturbance fre￾quency, fd, is 50 Hz, the transmissibility curves can be obtained using Eqs. 
4.16 and 4.19. In Figure 4.8b, the dotted line represents the transmissi￾bility obtained by the usual engineering definition (i.e., Eq. 4.1), and the 
solid line represents the real transmissibility described in this study [12]. 
In the real transmissibility, the plate is assumed to have a vibration contact 
point, whereas in the usual engineering transmissibility, no contact 90 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
occurs (i.e., Y = 0). The real transmissibility curve is based on the value 
of Y in Figure 4.8a. By contrast, Y = 0 is assumed in the typical engineering 
transmissibility. Figure 4.8b indicates that the two transmissibility 
curves have considerable differences. Real transmissibility is larger than 
usual transmissibility when the ratio of the forcing frequency to the nat￾ural frequency (fd/fn) exceeds 2.6. The real transmissibility curve reaches 
its peak when fd/fn is approximately 3.5. In other words, the real isolation 
efficiency is smaller than the usual isolation efficiency when fd/fn is greater 
than 2.6, and it reaches its lowest value when fd/fn is near 3.5. The common 
presumption is that fd/fn > 3 (T < 13%) can be used to select vibration 
isolators. However, Figure 4.8b shows that the real transmissibility can 
be considerably higher than the usual engineering transmissibility when 
fd/fn > 3 (particularly fd/fn = 3.6). The usual transmissibility is only 8.3%; 
in contrast, the real transmissibility exceeds 70%. The difference between 
the two in Figure 4.8b decreases as fd/fn increases. If fd/fn is large, the effect 
of the floor mobility, Y, of the plate can be ignored. When fd/fn is approxi￾mately 3.5, the real transmissibility is significantly greater than the usual 
transmissibility. Consequently, the actual isolation efficiency obtained 
using Eq. 4.21 is considerably less than the usual isolation efficiency 
obtained using Eq. 4.18. This possibly explains why vibration isolators 
sometimes do not perform well although they are selected according to the 
usual isolation efficiency.
The force transmissibility method, which is based on the usual engin￾eering definition of force transmissibility from Eq. 4.17, ignores the effect 
of floor mobility. The technique is based on an undamped lumped param￾eter system (i.e., a long wavelength limit) with a single degree of freedom 
(i.e., only vertical linear motion). In addition, a single contact point ignores 
the interactions of all the dynamic forces transmitted to the floor from the 
machine through the vibration isolators.

placed symmetrically on a simply-simply-simply-simply plate.Assessment of vibration isolation for machinery 91
4.4.2.5 Damped forced oscillatory system
The effect of damping is ignored in Eq. 4.17. However, in all linked systems, 
damping is present to varying degrees; consequently, it modifies some of the 
relationships.
The force transmissibility, TF, for a viscously damped forced oscillatory 
system is expressed as follows:

where
fd = forcing frequency;
fn = natural frequency;
ξ = C/Co, damping ratio of the mass–spring system;
C = actual damping; and
Co = critical damping (the damping value at which the oscillating motion 
commences).
An examination of the family of curves in Figure 4.9 shows that increasing the 
value of damping reduces not only the peak transmissibility at resonance but 
also the performance of the vibration isolator in the useful isolation region. To 
achieve maximum isolation, damping must be as low as possible; this is accept￾able for a majority of applications encountered by building service engineers.

(b) transmissibility curves.92 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
4.4.3 Power transmissibility
The force transmissibility method is commonly adopted in the industry 
because it is simple and convenient. However, it neglects the effect of floor 
mobility on the structure-borne sound power transmitted from a vibratory 
machine to the floor/roof as well as the interactions among several con￾tact points between the vibratory machine and floor/roof. This is because 
the method is based on a single contact point, single-degree-of-freedom 
(vertical linear motion), and lumped parameter system. Actual vibrating 
machines, such as fans, typically have several mounting points. The use of 
the power transmissibility method to assess the performance of vibration 
isolators may not be correct considering the following. (1) The effect of 
floor mobility cannot be ignored at natural frequencies. (2) The weight of a 
vibrating machine is not evenly distributed among several mounting points, 
Figure 4.9 Transmissibility for a viscously damped system.Assessment of vibration isolation for machinery 93
or (3) other vibrations exist in other degrees of freedom (such as rotations) 
at one of the mounting points.
The ‘power transmissibility method’ proposed by Mak et al. [15–18] 
was used to evaluate the vibration–isolation performance of a machine in a 
building. It is based on the ratio of structure-borne sound power. The power 
transmissibility is γ = ( )

The advantage of the power transmissibility method is that it considers 
the effect of floor mobility and interaction among all the dynamic forces 
transmitted to the floor through vibration isolators. Further studies [19] 
were conducted to incorporate the effect of viscous damping into the power 
transmissibility method. In addition, recent studies [14, 20] have been 
conducted to investigate the effect of inertia block on the stability of the 
vibratory system and performance of vibration isolation. Further work on 
the isolation of transient vibrations was conducted by Wang and Mak [21]. 
Therefore, the performance of vibration isolation can be assessed using the 
power transmissibility method. However, the method is constrained because 
it requires the availability or measurements of the source mobility, floor 
mobility, and the free velocity of the machine (vibratory source). The source 
mobility can be measured at the same support points using force actuators 
mounted with the elastically suspended machine. The floor mobility can 
be measured using electrodynamic shakers and force actuators. Mobility is 
measured as a transfer function using a dual-channel fast Fourier transform 
analyser.
4.4.4 Summary
The effect of floor mobility on the force transmissibility and isolation effi￾ciency of vibration isolators is discussed. The effective floor mobility increases 
the force transmissibility. In turn, the isolation efficiency decreases when fd/
fn exceeds 2.6 for the four contact points on the plate [16]. Other practical Assessment of vibration isolation for machinery 95
problems concerning vibration isolators are found in [13]. Floor mobility is 
important in the selection of vibration isolators because it affects the isola￾tion efficiency. The presumption [16] is that the sound radiating from the 
E&M equipment floor above a room and the walls surrounding the room 
can be reduced if floor mobility is considered in the selection of vibration 
isolators. The developed power transmissibility method [15] can estimate 
the performance of vibration isolators because it considers the effect of the 
dynamic interaction among all contact points and floor mobility.
4.5 USE OF INERTIA BLOCK FOR STABILISATION OF 
VIBRATION-ISOLATED MACHINES
The inertia block shown in Figure 4.10 is commonly used by engineers to 
stabilise vibration-isolated vibratory equipment. However, no comprehen￾sive guidelines for the selection of inertia blocks or indices for assessing 
the effect of these blocks on the stability of vibratory systems are available 
in the building industry. In addition to vibration isolation, the purpose of 
maintaining the ‘stability’ of the mounted vibratory system is to control the 
vibration and rotational velocities of mounted machines. This can prevent 
the vibrating and rocking motions from adversely affecting the mounting 
and normal operations of machines. In other words, the use of a heavy and 
rigid inertia block can reduce the motion of an isolated machine. Yun and 
Mak [14] proposed the use of ‘mounted vibration velocity’ and ‘mounted 
rotational velocity level’ of the vibratory machine for assessing the stability 
of the vibratory system. To evaluate the effect of the inertia block on the 
performance of the vibration isolation system, a vibratory machine model 
with four mounting points was used and analysed. The mass distribution 
was uneven, and the exciting force was eccentric. They indicated that the 
use of an inertia block did not affect the vibration isolation performance. 
Instead, the block decreased the vibration velocity and rotational velocity of 
the isolated vibratory machine. As a result, the inertia block increased the 
stability of the vibratory system regardless of whether the machine had a 
slightly or highly uneven mass distribution. Their results revealed that, for 
Figure 4.10 An isolated machine with an inertia block.96 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
a machine with a highly uneven mass distribution, the mounted vibratory 
machine required an inertia block with a large mass to enhance the stability 
of the isolated vibratory system.
4.6 VIBRATIONAL WAVES GENERATED IN SOLID FLOOR
The three main types of waves formed in solids are longitudinal, transverse, 
and bending. In general, longitudinal waves do not cause considerable direct 
radiation of sound into air. Nevertheless, they are important because of their 
ability to excite other parts of a structure to generate bending vibrations. 
These bending waves are extremely important because of their ability to 
radiate sounds. Further, they produce large deflections in the structure and 
cause considerable radiation of sound energy.
4.7 COUPLING WITH AIR AND EMISSION OF SOUND
Owing to the occasional inadequate design of vibration isolation, vibrations 
may be produced at the E&M floor that may, in turn, emit noise to the 
room just below this floor.
4.8 SUMMARY
This chapter introduces some fundamental knowledge on vibration isola￾tion and the assessment of the vibration isolation performance of air con￾ditioning or ventilation equipment. To understand the effect of acoustic 
environment on people due to vibration or sound sources, the succeeding 
chapter discusses psychoacoustic approaches.

Development of psychoacoustic 
prediction method
5.1 INTRODUCTION
The previous chapters discuss how duct-borne, flow-generated, and vibra￾tion noise is produced in ventilation ductwork systems. Over the last two 
decades, awareness of the negative impact of noise on the environment 
has increased [1]. The amount of scientific evidence on the impact of noise 
on aspects, such as working productivity, comfort, health, and well-being 
of occupants, continues to increase [2]. Therefore, the adverse effects of 
noise on ventilation ductwork systems can offset the benefits of improving 
indoor air quality. Although the definition that noise is an undesirable and 
unpleasant sound has been widely accepted, it involves a sophisticated psy￾chological process based on the perception of sound [3]. As a result, noise 
management [4] cannot simply pertain to sound pressure level (SPL) reduc￾tion. Ma et al. [3] found that the universal fundamental underlying struc￾ture of the human perception of sounds consisted of three latent perceptual 
dimensions: subjective evaluation of general judgement (Evaluation, E), sen￾sitivity to magnitude (Potency, P), and sensation of temporal and spectral 
compositions of sound (Activity, A). These three perceptual dimensions, 
representing the factorial structure of human perception of sounds, are 
collectively referred to as the EPA model. Psychoacoustics is a branch of 
psychophysics that investigates the objective characteristics and subjective 
perceptual influence of noisy indoor environments. The psychoacoustic 
approach, which considers both auditory and non-auditory effects of noise, 
can provide an accurate prediction of human perceptual judgements of 
noise. With the support of objective psychoacoustic metrics and subjective 
psychometric properties, the multidimensional psychological impacts on the 
human perception of noise can be effectively evaluated and predicted.
5.2 OBJECTIVE PSYCHOACOUSTIC APPROACH
When sound waves propagate into the human cochlea, the basilar mem￾brane of the organ of Corti is excited. Auditory signals are then transduced 100 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
by hair cells, i.e., sensory cells in the organ of Corti, to electrical nerve 
impulses travelling to the brain. Because the resonance of sound waves 
of different frequencies is particularly intense at different regions of the 
basilar membrane, frequency dependence of human hearing depends on 
this (Figure 5.1). In 1933, Harvey Fletcher [5] introduced the concept of 
critical bands to describe the frequency bandwidth of ‘band-pass auditory 
filters’ created by particular regions of the basilar membrane. Subsequently, 
Eberhard Zwicker proposed the psychoacoustical scale, ‘Bark scale’, in 
1961. A total of 24 critical bands in Bark scale were directly measured in 
a series of loudness approximation experiments [6]. Bark scale is one of 
the most popular psychoacoustic scales applied worldwide. This is because 
its complex band-pass filter can more accurately approximate the non￾linear behaviour of the human auditory system than the 1/3-octave band￾pass filter used in the traditional acoustic approach on a logarithmic scale 
(Figure 5.2). The numerical details of the two scales are shown in Figure 1.1
in Chapter 1.
5.2.1 Total loudness (N)
The traditional norm for assessing indoor environments is based on noise 
indices, such as noise criteria (NC), nose rating (NR), room constant (RC), 
and equivalent continuous SPL (LAeq) [7, 8]. Although they can provide 
a single-value assessment of the acceptability of indoor noise environments, 
the noise features of environments and their psychological impact 
Figure 5.1 Simplified schematic of basilar membrane in organ of Corti for characterising 
high-to-low frequency auditory signals from base to apex.Development of psychoacoustic prediction method 101
on occupants (other than occupant sensitivity to noise magnitude) have 
not been well assessed [9–11]. Psychoacoustic metrics are used to estimate 
actual sensations of sounds based on human auditory responses to both 
energy and spectral contents of sound [12]. In assessing the acoustic comfort 
of indoor environments, the performance of the psychoacoustic metric N is 
better than those of NC and NR [13].
Before calculating N, the specific loudness (N’) of each critical band 
(Bark band) must be calculated. According to Stevens’ law of psycho￾physics [14], the intensity of sound wave stimulus (in terms of excita￾tion) is hypothesised to be proportional to the perceived magnitude of the 
loudness sensation:
N E′( ) ∝ Ek , (5.1)
where E is the excitation level of a stimulus entering the organ of Corti; 
N′ is the specific loudness of loudness sensation at a critical band; and k is 
the exponential constant of loudness sensation. When a noticeable change

(ΔN′) occurs due to a change in excitation (ΔE), Eq. 5.1 can be expressed 
as Eq. 5.2:
∆ ∆ ′
′ + = +
N
N N
k E

, (5.2)
where N′MT and EMT are the specific loudness and reference excitation of the 
masked threshold, respectively. The masked threshold is the internal noise 
floor, which is considerably less than the values of N′ and E′. The relation￾ship between the masked threshold and threshold in quiet is described by 
the threshold factor (s) given by Eq. 5.3:
E
E
s
T
MT = , (5.3)
where ET is the excitation of the threshold in quiet and EMT is the excitation 
of masked threshold produced by a test tone and within the critical band at 
the test-tone frequency.
By considering Eq. 5.2 as a differential equation, it can be solved by inte￾grating both sides. The solution of this equation is as follows:
Ln MT MT ( ) N N ′ + ′ = + k E ln( ) E C+ , (5.4)
where C is an unknown constant of the integration. Using reasonable 
boundary conditions, i.e., N = 0 and E = 0, the constant C is found. 
Substituting C N = ln ln ( ) MT MT ′ − k E( ) into Eq. 5.4 yields Eq. 5.5, as follows:

1 sone. By replacing ‘1’ inside the brackets in Eq. 5.8 by (1 − s), the expres￾sion becomes

Details of the values of k and s are found in Eberhard Zwicker’s book [12] 
and the computation guideline of N is found in ISO-532, which is an inter￾national standard [15].
5.2.2 Sharpness (S)
Although the spectral content of sounds is considered in the calculation of 
N, only the effect of this content on the loudness sensation is judged. The 104 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
psychoacoustic metric S is designed to characterise the skewness of energy 
distribution to high-frequency components. This is achieved by introducing 
an additional frequency weighting for the human sharpness sensation, as 
follows:

(5.12)
where g(z) is critical-band-rate dependent (Figure 5.3).
The unit of S is acum, which means ‘sharp’ in Latin; a 60-dB 1-kHz pure 
tone or narrow-band sound within the ninth Bark band is equal to 1 acum. 
The equation for S is as follows:

In the foregoing equation, the denominator is the total loudness, N, implying 
that S is a normalised metric. The comparison of S values is a comparison 
Figure 5.3 Plot of critical-band-rate dependent on 24 Bark bands.Development of psychoacoustic prediction method 105
of the skewness of the energy distribution (spectral envelope) of sounds to 
high-frequency components, as shown in Figure 5.4. A higher skewness of 
the energy distribution to high-frequency components is observed in envir￾onment 2, which has a higher S value.
Ma et al. [16] found that the S value is a valuable index for evaluating 
the health risks of people in an environment with high-frequency noise. 
The increase in low-frequency noise from ventilation systems can be one of 
the solutions to counteract the health risk from high-frequency noise; this 
can be achieved by reducing the S value in the environment. The results pro￾vide another perspective for noise control and show that SPL reduction is 
not the only means for managing noise.
5.2.3 Roughness (R)
In real-life situations, noise is a complex sound comprising different fre￾quency components instead of a pure test tone of a single frequency. The 
human hearing system is unable to differentiate the components of a fre￾quency pair that have the same amplitude and stimuli in the same critical 
band. Although more than one frequency component exists, the same region 
in the basilar membrane is excited. Otherwise, a feeling of roughness is 
created if the sound consists of multiple frequency components of different 
amplitudes and are in multiple critical bands. Frequency and temporal 
resolution are the two main factors considered in the calculation of the 
psychoacoustic metric, R:
R f ~ , L mod∆ (5.14)
Figure 5.4 Spectral envelope of (a) environment 1 and (b) environment 2 in terms of spec￾trum of specific loudness (N’) in 24 Bark bands.106 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
where fmod is the frequency for modulating the effect of frequency resolution 
(Hz), and ΔL is the temporal depth for masking the effect of temporal reso￾lution (dB). For a more precise estimation of R, the following is proposed:
R f ~ . L z dz mod
Bark
0
24 ∫ ∆ ( ) (5.15)
The unit of R is asper, which means ‘rough’ in Latin; a 60-dB 1-kHz tone 
with 100% amplitude modulation at 70 Hz is equal to 1 asper. After intro￾ducing this boundary condition, the equation for R becomes
R f L z dz as

The experimental results of Zwicker et al. [12] showed that the roughness 
sensation of sounds was negligible if fmod < 15 Hz or fmod > 300 Hz.
5.2.4 Fluctuation strength (FS)
If the modulation frequency of sound is low (fmod < ~20), a sensation of fluc￾tuating strength rather than a sensation of roughness is generated. Because 
the sensation of fluctuation is found to be strongest if fmod = 4 Hz, the empir￾ical equation considering the effects of frequency and temporal resolutions 
is as follows:

this boundary condition, the equation of FS becomes

5.3 SUBJECTIVE PSYCHOACOUSTIC APPROACH
The objective psychoacoustic approach using psychoacoustic metrics and 
the subjective approach by measuring human responses to the acoustic 
environment are equally important in psychoacoustic studies. Subjective Development of psychoacoustic prediction method 107
measurement data are crucial to determining how human perception is 
affected by the acoustic environment and the mechanism behind human 
perception. Therefore, the reliability and validity of the study’s findings are 
critically challenged if inappropriate subjective measurement tools are used. 
For the objective psychoacoustic approach, the accuracy and precision of 
the measurement can be improved using better acoustic equipment with 
higher standards. Over the years, several investigators have endeavoured 
to devise a method for assessing the perceptual influence of environmental 
noise on occupants [17–21]. However, the heterogeneous nature of different 
psychoacoustic studies has increased the difficulty of standardising subjective 
assessment methods. Fortunately, this problem has been resolved by the 
critical systematic review and meta-analysis of Ma et al. [3]. Their findings 
provide insights into the fundamental mechanism of the human perception 
of sounds. Subsequently, a psychometric tool, the psychoacoustics percep￾tion scale (PPS), was designed to quantify human subjective responses. The 
PPS was found to be a valid, reliable, and applicable assessment tool for 
any built environment [22]. In the future, PPS is anticipated to be a valuable 
psychometric tool for standardising the subjective psychoacoustic approach 
of studies.
5.3.1 Rating methods
A semantic differential scale was applied to the PPS. This scale, proposed by 
Osgood in 1952, is a commonly used psychological scale [23] to represent 
the ‘meaning of things’ quantitively. The first psychoacoustic approach 
using a semantic differential scale to represent the ‘human perceptions of 
sounds’ quantitatively was implemented by Solomon in 1959 [24]. A sys￾tematic review conducted by Ma et al. [3] integrated the significant results 
of all accessible English language psychoacoustic studies in finding ‘human 
perceptions of sounds’ after 1959. The meta-analysis of the results of eligible 
studies extracted universal findings. The three fundamental human percep￾tual dimensions of sounds are found to be ‘Evaluation (E)’, ‘Potency (P)’, 
and ‘Activity (A)’, pertaining to the human general judgement, sensitivity 
to magnitude, and sensation of the temporal and spectral compositions of 
perceived sound, respectively (Figure 5.5).
The PPS is a psychometric tool consisting of nine semantic differential 
questions. Each question is formed by a bipolar adjective pair (AP) with 
two descriptors of opposite meanings. The score for each item in the PPS 
ranges from −3 to +3. For example, the AP score of ‘Pleasant–Unpleasant’ 
has seven levels: ‘Extremely Pleasant (−3), ‘Quite Pleasant (−2)’, ‘Slightly 
Pleasant (−1)’, ‘Equally (0)’, ‘Slightly Unpleasant (1)’, ‘Quite Unpleasant 
(2)’, and ‘Extremely Unpleasant (3)’. The E, P, and A scores are defined as 
the sum of the three compulsory APs in the factors. The total EPA score is 
defined as the sum of all nine APs in the PPS. The ‘human perceptions of 108 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
sounds’ can be represented by their positions in the semantic spaces of E, 
P, and A scores. The foregoing depicts a general picture of the perceived 
acoustic environment, facilitating the comparison of sounds in different 
aspects rather than merely comparing magnitudes.
5.3.2 Adjective pair (AP, Descriptors)
The proper selection of questions is the first and most important step in 
any subjective assessment. Improper selection by including redundant and 
irrelevant questions lengthens the time of assessment, increases the difficulty 
of subject recruitment, reduces the concentration of subjects on the 
assessment, and affects the reliability of measurement results [25]. In con￾trast, the lack of important questions limits the validity and generality of 
the assessment results. In a systematic review by Ma et al. [3], a total of 5 
677 participants, 828 756 ratings, 1 365 sounds, and 686 descriptors were 
included in the 45 eligible studies on the assessment of human perceptions 
of various indoor and outdoor sounds using a semantic differential scale. 
Quantitative meta-analysis was based on the extracted data of the 27 
APs applied to the eligible studies after an important analysis. All 27 APs 
were significant in assessing the human perception of sound. The meta￾analysis of the extracted data further confirmed that a minimum of nine 
APs were required to represent the acoustic environment quantitatively in 
Figure 5.5 Schematic of semantic spaces formed by three fundamental human perceptual 
dimensions of sounds: ‘Evaluation’, ‘Potency’, and ‘Activity’.Development of psychoacoustic prediction method 109
three fundamental human perceptual dimensions of sounds. The three most 
suitable APs for assessing the general human judgement of sound in the E 
dimension are ‘Quiet–Noisy’, ‘Relaxed–Tense’, and ‘Pleasant–Unpleasant’. 
The three most suitable APs for assessing the human sensitivity to the mag￾nitude of sound in the P dimension are ‘Quiet–Loud’, ‘Light–Heavy’, and 
‘Weak–Strong’. The three most suitable APs for assessing the human sensa￾tion of the temporal and spectral compositions of sound in the A dimension 
are ‘Deep–Metallic’, ‘Low–High’, and ‘Dull–Sharp’. The meta-analysis 
results also show a potential association between the other perceptions and 
the E, P, and A dimensions (Table 5.1). The PPS only requires the inclusion 
of the nine compulsory APs in the E, P, and A dimensions; researchers have 
the freedom to assess other perceptions based on their own research purpose 
or interest. The use of PPS can aid in reducing the diversity in the selection 
of APs and hence also reduce the discrepancy among the analytical results 
of psychoacoustic studies.
5.4 VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF PPS
The PPS is the first designed psychometric tool based on the universal 
underlying structure of the human perceptual dimensions of sound [3]. The 
PPS utilizes the EPA model, which serves as an integrated representation

of the three fundamental perceptual dimensions and their underlying 
factorial structure (Figure 5.6). It considerably simplifies the subjective 
assessment without missing any important human perception of sound. 
The PPS was further validated by Ma et al. as a reliable and applicable 
psychometric tool for qualitatively assessing the perceptions of the general 
judgement, energy content, and temporal and spectral contents of 
sound [22]. The high values of the test–retest Cronbach’s αs and composite 
reliabilities of compulsory items in the E, P, and A dimensions demonstrate 
the satisfactory internal consistency of the items. The results also 
verified the reliability of the PPS in assessing the E, P, and A dimensions. 
They also supported the use of E, P, and A scores to represent the sound 
quality of the acoustic environment in the designed dimensions quantita￾tively. The E, P, and A scores can be treated as indices of the sound quality 
of the environment and used in analysing the environmental influence on 
occupants. In general, the factorial structure in terms of factor loading, 
scalar, factor covariance, and error variances of the P and A dimensions 
was found to be invariant across gender. The total EPA score can represent 
the joint contribution of the E, P, and A dimensions and serve as a signifi￾cant predictor of other perceptions. The development of PPS may be 
valuable for psychoacoustic studies. The PPS is a potentially fundamental 
psychometric tool to standardise subjective assessment methods in the 
psychoacoustic approach.

5.5 PSYCHOACOUSTIC PREDICTION METHOD
5.5.1 Objective psychoacoustic metric
The prediction of psychoacoustic metrics [26, 27] can be improved by 
considering the effects of spatial variation (Figure 5.7). Improved environ￾mental noise control [28] can be achieved by accurately predicting the noise 
of building elements [29–33] and measuring the noise outdoors [34–36] and 
indoors [37]. Sound attenuation during propagation is not a new concept 
in acoustics. The inverse square distance law for the distance dependence 
of sound intensity is well known. Ma et al. [26] found that the effects of 
distance should be considered using sound energy content-related metrics. 
Moreover, the psychoacoustic metric, N, of the perceived loudness sensation 
of subjects was predictable in sound propagation. A subjective life experi￾ence in which loudness decreased as the distance increased was found. Their 
study is the first to provide a scientific and objective method for predicting 
the decrement in loudness using psychoacoustic metrics. The study results 
[26] provide a new approach to estimate the values of N at different positions 
successfully from a noise source. The numerical approximation of N in the 
inverse power, 0.46 of D, was firstly proposed based on the study results. 
Owing to the non-linearity of logarithmic functions in the unweighted SPL 
(LZ) and A-weighted SPL (LA) calculations, the magnitude of environmental 
change cannot be easily interpreted by the changes in LZ and LA values.
For example, the magnitudes of changes in environmental sound energy 
and occupants’ loudness perception of a 6-dBA decrement in 30-dBA and 
50-dBA rooms are different. The changes in LZ and LA values may not be 
suitable metrics for the statistical analysis and prediction of environmental 
effects on subjective responses. The N measurement serves as an alterna￾tive to environmental assessment and prediction. Because the unit of N is a 
linear scale (sone scale), the difference among N values can be interpreted. 
As mentioned, the resulting 6-dBA decrement when the distance from the 
sound source is doubled cannot clearly explain the environmental influence 
on acoustic properties or subjective responses. In contrast, the decrease in 
N value during sound propagation allows people to perceive the extent 
to which the environment has quieted down. The offhand prediction of 
psychoacoustic metrics is now possible. In Eq. 5.9, when the excitation 
(sound intensity) of sound considerably exceeds that of Eref (1012 W∙m−2), 
N’ is approximated to a power 0.23 of the excitation. Therefore, N’ was 
approximated to the inverse power of 0.46 of the distance (D) from the 
noise source. In other words, doubling the distance from the sound source 
causes the value of N to be 0.73 times smaller (Eq. 5.19). The predictability 
of psychoacoustic metrics with spatial variation is demonstrated for the 
first time:112 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems

(5.19)
where ND (ND’) is the total loudness at distance D (D′) from the noise source.
The effect of emission orientation was observed when the distance from the 
sound source was less than 0.3 m. The properties of sound energy content 
were characterised by metrics LA and N, whereas those of the sound spectral 
content were characterised by metric S. In contrast, the spectral content￾related properties were not sensitive to changes in spatial variation. The 
findings fill the research gap in psychoacoustic measurements and provide 
guidance for the future environmental assessment and prediction of sound 
energy content as well as temporal and spectral contents.
5.5.2 Subjective response
The PPS development provides a guideline applicable to the construction of 
a subjective scale for assessing the built environment. Moreover, it promotes 
Figure 5.7 Summary of proposed holistic psychoacoustic approach to building acoustics.Development of psychoacoustic prediction method 113
the possibility of psychoacoustic prediction from objective acoustic prop￾erties to subjective responses. Occupant-oriented decision-making can be 
achieved in future building designs by providing acceptable psychoacoustic 
prediction. A holistic psychoacoustic approach can also aid in understanding 
the human–environment interactions between the acoustic environment, 
human perceptions, and other potential noise impacts, such as office prod￾uctivity [38], satisfaction [39], and health risks [16, 40]. The foregoing is 
key to sustainable noise control designs for building ventilation systems 
[41]. The study conducted by Ma et al. showed that the monitoring of S and 
N of noise was required because it could serve as an indicator for assessing 
noise impacts on indoor environments [16]. Although similar results were 
found between the measurements of LAeq and N of the overall perceived 
loudness of noise, the N’ spectral analysis demonstrated its ability to assess 
the corresponding loudness changes from different frequency components 
of noise. The capacity to identify perceived loudness changes from different 
noise sources, such as ventilation systems, is important for environmental 
noise evaluation, especially for indoor environments. Further attention must 
also be given to the frequency components of indoor environments. This is 
because noise sharpness is associated with negative short-term psychological 
symptoms affecting the states of hearing and health in occupations. The 
calculation of S provided more specific information on the sound quality 
of noise than on overall loudness. Thus, the quantification of the sound 
quality of noise aids in understanding the effects of noise on the health con￾dition related to occupation. The results of the study showed the capacity 
of psychoacoustics metrics in quantifying the sound quality of noise and 
estimating its negative impact on health associated with occupation. The 
energy and spectral contents of the indoor environment affect the prevalence 
of long-term and short-term negative health symptoms, respectively [16].
In the studies of Ma et al. [42, 43], the temporal content of the environ￾ment in terms of the statistical noise level of psychoacoustic metrics (e.g., 
N10, N50, and N90) can aid in predicting environmental noise impacts. In gen￾eral, the acoustic influence of a significant noise source can be represented by 
LA10, N10, and S10, and ambient noise can be represented by LA50, N50, LAeq, 
Neq, and Seq. The statistical analysis of N disclosed the perceptual influence 
on the noise sensitivity of occupants, further affecting their behaviour. The 
statistical analysis of S also reveals that this metric is a significant indicator 
of the behavioural influence of noise on occupants. For long-term develop￾ment, the impact of metrics LA90, N90, and S90 of the background noise level 
on general occupational health was also determined. These findings provide 
insights into future noise management to assess, monitor, evaluate, predict, 
and control the effect of noise on occupants [43].
In dealing with maximum noise levels, metrics LAmax, Nmax, and LA10–
LA90 can aid in distinguishing the variations in the perceptions of subjects 
between two different environments [42]. The perception of sound variation 114 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
was more related to the variation in spectral content than to the energy con￾tent of sounds. Traditional LAeq monitoring is insufficient for predicting the 
perceptual influence on people. Monitoring the maximum noise level and 
other metrics regarding the spectral and temporal contents of the acoustic 
environment is recommended. The analyses of preferences can provide 
insight into the balance between the space utilisation of the built environ￾ment and environmental improvement. High, medium, and low preferences 
were found for the natural, human-made, and mechanical sounds in the 
environment, respectively [42]. The insertion of natural sounds and the 
elimination of mechanical sounds are the two main directions of acoustic 
improvement. The responses of subjects can provide important information 
to the further design of ventilation noise systems.
5.6 SUMMARY
This chapter introduces fundamental knowledge on traditional objective 
psychoacoustic metrics and up-to-date subjective psychometric (PPS) in the 
psychoacoustic approach. Examples of holistic psychoacoustic assessments 
and predictions of ventilation noise are discussed in Chapter 6.

Case studies and examples
6.1 INTRODUCTION
Case studies or examples are presented in the following sections to illus￾trate the prediction of transmission noise, flow-generated noise, vibration 
isolation performance, and human psychoacoustic responses discussed in 
Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.
6.2 CALCULATION OF NOISE TRANSMISSION 
IN AIR DUCT
The following is a typical example of the acoustic design of a ventilation 
ductwork system. Flow-generated noise and break-out noise are ignored in 
this calculation. An open-plan office with dimensions of 10 m × 8 m × 3 m 
is provided with a ventilation ductwork system, as shown in Figure 6.1. For 
noise control, a dissipative silencer is installed in the air distribution duct￾work system. The reverberation time in the office is assumed to be 0.9 s. The 
total amount of conditioned air is evenly distributed from an air-handling 
unit to the office through six 0.1 m2 supply air outlets. The air ducts are 
plain without any internal acoustic lining. The critical point of noise in the 
room is assumed to be 1.2 m directly under any supply air outlet. The design 
criterion for the maximum allowable noise level, Lp, Allow, in the room is 
assumed to be 35 dB at the 2-kHz octave-band centre frequency; the sound 
power level of the fan at this frequency is 82 dB. The length of the 450 × 
400-mm main air duct from the silencer to the first branch is 8 m, and the 
length of the 350 mm × 250 mm branch air duct is 1.8 m. To estimate the 
required attenuation given by the dissipative silencer at 2 kHz, determining 
the total sound pressure at a point by logarithmic addition of direct and 
reverberant sound levels is necessary.
The following data are used to calculate the noise transmission:
• The attenuation per metre run of the 450 × 400-mm section of the 
main air duct at 2 kHz is assumed to be 0.125 dB/m.118 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
• The attenuation of the 350 × 250-mm branch air duct at 2 kHz is 
insignificant.
• Attenuation due to other possible in-duct components can be ignored.
• The correction for the direct sound pressure level in the room 
corresponding to the outlet size and position at 2 kHz is assumed to 
be 9 dB.
• The average absorption coefficient in the office is less than 0.1.
• The end reflection from the 0.1m2 outlet at high frequencies is 
assumed to be 0.
The estimation of the required attenuation, Lp,Atten, by the silencer at 2 kHz 
is as follows:
1. Determine the sound power level, Lw, at outlets:
Lw = 82 – 0.125 × 8 = 81 dB.

6.3 PREDICTION OF FLOW-GENERATED NOISE USING 
PRESSURE-BASED PREDICTION METHOD
6.3.1 Flow-generated noise experiment
An experiment was conducted by Mak et al. [1] to verify the results 
predicted by the two predictive equations for flow-generated noise 
(Eqs. 3.22 and 3.23). A schematic of the experimental test rig is 
shown in Figure 6.2(a). A three-phase variable-speed centrifugal flow 
fan constrained from vibration by four springs and placed in a lined 
acoustic enclosure was used to provide airflow. Silencers and acoustically 
lined elbows were installed to attenuate noise from the upstream and 120 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
downstream sides. To reduce the breakout noise from the 0.1 × 0.1-m 
steel test air duct, a 25-mm-thick lining made of absorbing material was 
placed on each side of the duct. Hence, a quiet and fully developed flow 
through the first test piece starting from the inlet of airflow was obtained. 
The first flow spoiler was located at approximately 1.75 m away from 
the duct entrance section. The second and third spoilers were situated 1 
and 3 m downstream from the first spoiler, respectively. The total length 
of the duct including the extended part of the reverberation chamber was 
5.45 m. The chamber had an outlet cone of 0.16 m × 0.16 m and a length 
of 0.3 m for acoustic measurement. The chamber was also equipped with 
lined outlet ducts enabling air to escape without noise. The experimental 
test rig was located in another reverberation chamber to ensure that the 
level of sound measured in the system consistently exceeded the back￾ground noise level in the laboratory.
The spoilers used in the experiment were made of a 1-mm-thick steel 
plate to provide a relatively rigid obstruction without significant vibration in 
the air stream. The spoiler plates were fixed using springs and force 
transducers between the flanges of the two adjoining sections of the test 
duct. A compressed foam rubber was used to seal the gaps. Figure 6.2(b) and 
(c) shows the cross-section of the duct with the two main types of spoilers 
used in the experiment. A strip spoiler is centrally placed, and two strip 
Figure 6.2 (a) Schematic of experimental test rig using two main types of spoilers; (b) cen￾trally placed strip spoiler; and (c) two strip plates placed symmetrically at both 
sides of the duct leaving central vertical strip of duct open.Case studies and examples 121
plates are symmetrically placed on both sides of the duct by leaving a vertical 
opening at the centre of the duct. The height of the strip is equal to that 
of the test duct (0.1 m). The various spoiler widths used in the experiments 
are shown in Figure 6.2. Various spoiler configurations under different 
mean flow velocities are chosen to validate the prediction of flow-generated 
noise, as illustrated in Figure 6.3. The first four experiments (Tests 1, 2, 3, 
and 4) for each single spoiler are conducted to obtain the normalised spec￾trum, as shown in Figure 6.5. Seven experiments (Tests 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 
Figure 6.3 Different spoiler configurations (Tests 1–13) under different mean flow veloci￾ties in experimental test rig shown in Figure 6.1.122 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
11) included two spoilers, whereas the last two experiments (Tests 12 and 
13) considered three spoilers.
6.3.2 Normalisation of experimental results for 
single-flow spoiler
The measured in-duct sound power levels (Lw,D) for Test 1 in the experiment 
of Mak et al. [1] are shown in Figure 6.4, depicting the typical characteristics 
of flow-generated noise. For instance, peak Lw,D occur at extremely low fre￾quencies, and a systematic decrease in Lw,D with increasing frequency is 
observed. In addition, the increase in Lw,D with velocity is greater at frequen￾cies exceeding the duct cut-on frequency. The measured values of the 
drag coefficient (CD) and the Lw,D of the experiment conducted by Mak et al. 
were normalised for Tests 1–4 based on the equations of Nelson and Morfey 
(Eqs. 3.14 and 3.15). They found that the collapse of experimental data 
is remarkable, as shown in Figure 6.5 [1]. The normalised results of all 
the tested spoilers agreed well with the trend lines of Nelson and Morfey 
[2]. A trend line based on simple linear relationships over the range of 
measurements was derived.

measured results
The normalised spectrum is shown in Figure 6.5. This figure and the 
coherence functions (i.e., two predictive equations for flow-generated 
noise (Eqs. 3.22 and 3.23)) for multiple in-duct flow spoilers are used to 
predict the Lw,D produced by the two or three flow spoilers in Tests 5–13. 
The predicted and measured results of the Lw,D in the nine tests are shown 
in Figures 6.6 and 6.7. Excellent and consistent agreement between the 
measured and predicted results for all test combinations of the spoilers 
was observed at most frequencies and mean duct flow velocities. The 
error between the predicted and measured results at most frequencies was 
±0–3 dB except for some particular frequencies and mean flow velocity. 
The deviation between the predicted and measured results at certain fre￾quencies at or exceeding 4 kHz for a particular flow may have been due 
to the vibration modes of the flow spoilers or the duct system at high 
frequencies.
The results suggest that the predictive equations for multiple in-duct flow 
spoilers are useful for predicting the level and spectral contents of the flow￾generated noise produced by multiple in-duct flow spoilers at the design 
stage. This is because the prediction is based on a normalised spectrum, 
Figure 6.5 Overall collapse of normalised data for all tested single spoilers in Tests 1–4.124 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
and all the parameters used in the prediction can be obtained through 
measurements. Therefore, the predictive equations become the basis of the 
generalised prediction method for the flow-generated noise produced by 
multiple in-duct elements.

ISOLATION USING POWER TRANSMISSIBILITY 
METHOD
The work of Mak and Su considered a vibratory machine model with 
four symmetrical supports on a square concrete plate [2]. The model, 
shown in Figure 6.8, has the following physical parameters for the concrete 
plate: density, ρ = 2.8 × 103 kg/m3; Young’s modulus, E = 2.1 × 1010
N∙m−2; loss factor, η = 2 × 10−2; and Poisson’s ratio, μ = 0.2. The geometrical 
dimensions are length (l) = 3.5 m, width (W) = 3.5 m, and the thickness is 
d = 0.24 m. The real and imaginary parts of the effective mobility of the con￾tact point of the square concrete plate can be obtained from [3], as shown 
in Figure 6.9(a). The mobility value is extremely small at most frequencies 
but becomes relatively large when the frequency range is 48–52 Hz. The

and p3.126 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
power transmissibility, γ (Eqs. 4.23 and 4.24 for single and four contact 
points, respectively), and dynamic forces transmitted to the floor against 
distributing frequencies if the mass, m = 500 kg (i.e., the machine mass, 
M = 2,000 kg) and the chosen natural frequency, fn = 15 Hz are shown in 
Figure 6.9(b) and (c), respectively. As shown in Figure 6.9(c), the source￾inherent vibratory force, Fo ( F j o o = ωMV ), is equal to 1.
Figure 6.9(b) shows that γ is less than 1 at most frequencies (except 48–
52 Hz); then, it decreases with increasing frequencies starting from 52 Hz. 
A peak γ value (approximately 10) is observed when the frequency is 48–52 
Hz. This indicates that the power transmitted to the floor increases when the 
spring isolator is installed at frequencies between 48 and 52 Hz because of 
the effect of large floor mobility.
Based on the definition of force transmissibility (Eq. 4.17), the force trans￾mitted to the floor with a spring isolator via the contact point must be smaller 
than that without the spring isolator when ω ω/ n > 2 . Figure 6.9(c) shows 
that at most frequencies (except for frequencies between 48 and 52 Hz), the 
force transmitted to the floor with the spring isolator through a contact point 
is considerably less than that without the spring isolator. The dynamic force 
transmitted to the floor with the spring isolator at frequencies between 48 
and 52 Hz exceeded that transmitted to the floor without the spring isolator. 
Similarly, Figure 6.9(b) shows that the power at most frequencies (except for 
frequencies between 48 and 52 Hz) is reduced after the installation of the 
spring isolator (γ < 1). Therefore, at most frequencies, both the total power 
and dynamic force transmitted to the floor are reduced after the installation of 
the spring isolator. However, they increase at frequencies between 48 and 52 
Hz, approximating the resonant frequency of the floor shown in Figure 6.9(a).
A vibratory machine with four symmetrical supports placed asymmetric￾ally on the same plate, as shown in Figure 6.10, is considered. The same 
physical and geometric dimensions are used. Because the real and imaginary 
Figure 6.8 Schematics of (a) machine of mass M with four symmetrical contact points and 
(b) four simple vibrating systems of each mass, m (m = M/4), with four sym￾metrical contact points on a simply-simply-simply-simply square concrete plate.Case studies and examples 127
parts of all mobilities for the four contact points have similar shapes, only 
one floor mobility, Y11, is shown in Figure 6.11(a). The floor mobility is 
inconsiderable at most frequencies (except between 48.5 and 50.5 Hz). 
A peak mobility value is observed at frequencies between 48.5 and 50.5 
Hz, approximating the resonant frequency of the floor. If the machine mass, 
M, is 2,000 kg, α2 is 1.8 for the rectangular steel machine model with 
L = 1.485 m, l = 1.185 m, and H = 0.32 m; the steel density is ρs = 7.85 × 
103 kg∙m−3; and the natural frequency is 15 Hz. The power transmissibility, 
γ (Eq. 4.24), against distributing frequency for a rectangular steel machine 
is shown in Figure 6.11(b).
Figure 6.11(b) shows that at most frequencies (except between 48.5 and 
50.5 Hz), the power transmissibility, γ, is less than 1 and decreases with 
increasing frequencies starting from 50.5 Hz. Figure 6.12 shows that the 
forces transmitted to the floor through four contact points considerably 
decrease after the installation of spring isolators at frequencies in the range 
Figure 6.9 Plots of (a) effective mobility of the simply-simply-simply-simply concrete plate; 
(b) power transmissibility (γ); and (c) force transmitted to floor through each 
contact point against disturbing frequency (natural frequency: 15 Hz).128 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
40–60 Hz (approximately 1/6 of that without a spring isolator). However, 
interestingly, in Figure 6.11(b), the power transmissibility, γ, considerably 
exceeds 1 (i.e., approximately 3–4) at frequencies near 50 Hz. This means 
that the total active power transmitted to the floor with spring isolators is 
three to four times greater than that without spring isolators. Force trans￾missibility is based on the force transmitted to the floor through the contact 
point, thus providing information regarding this force. In contrast, power 
transmissibility provides information pertaining to the actual total power 
transmitted to the floor through all contact points. At a forcing frequency 
of 50 Hz and natural frequency of 15 Hz, the dynamic forces transmitted to

the floor through contact points 1, 2, 3, and 4 decrease from 0.573 + 0.016j 
(magnitude 0.573) to −0.038 − 0.015j (magnitude: 0.041); from 0.315 +
0.007j (magnitude 0.315) to −0.064 − 0.043j (magnitude: 0.077); from 
−0.365–0.030j (magnitude: 0.366) to −0.048 − 0.025j (magnitude: 0.054); 
and from −0.365 − 0.030j (magnitude: 0.366) to –0.048 − 0.025j (magni￾tude: 0.054), respectively. Evidently, the magnitudes of the forces trans￾mitted to the floor through each contact point decrease and have different 
phases after the installation of the spring isolator. Owing to the interaction 
among the four contact points (i.e., the phase relationships among the four 
transmitted forces), force cancellations or reinforcing forces are required 
among the four transmitted forces. The total power transmitted to the floor 
is therefore the result of the four transmitted forces. The result of the total 
active power transmitted to the floor through the four contact points at 
frequencies approximating the resonant frequency of the floor shown in 
Figure 6.11(b) is found to have an opposite effect. Different from the forces 
transmitted to the floor, the total active power transmitted increases at a 
forcing frequency of 50 Hz after the installation of the spring isolators. 
Nevertheless, Figures 6.11(b) and 6.12 show that both the force and total 
Figure 6.12 Plots of forces transmitted to floor through contact points (a) 1; (b) 2; (c) 3; 
and (d) 4.130 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
active power transmitted to the floor decrease at most frequencies (except 
at frequencies near the resonant frequency of the floor) after the installation 
of the spring isolators. Therefore, different from force transmissibility, 
power transmissibility provides information regarding the actual power 
transmitted to the floor and has engineering importance. In this example, 
force transmissibility indicates that the spring isolator operates well at all 
frequencies, including forcing frequencies near 50 Hz; however, this conclu￾sion is inaccurate.
6.5 PREDICTION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSES
An air-conditioning ventilation system is an essential component of buildings 
to maintain a good indoor environmental quality. Satisfactory ventilation 
system design must minimise the negative impact of noise on occupants. 
This case study endeavours to demonstrate how the holistic psychoacoustic 
approach, discussed in Chapter 5, can aid in the investigation of the multi￾dimensional psychological impacts of ventilation noise on occupants. The 
objective characteristics of different ventilation noise are assessed using a 
list of traditional acoustic and psychoacoustic metrics. The noise impact 
on the perception of occupants and degree of attention are assessed using 
the psychoacoustics perception scale (PPS) [4] and letter cancellation task 
(LCT), respectively. The statistical analysis results of the case study indicate 
the means for efficiently quantifying the psychological impacts of ventila￾tion noise on the general judgement (Evaluation, E) and magnitude sensi￾tivity (Potency, P) of occupants. Moreover, the results show the approach 
for determining the sensation of the temporal and spectral compositions 
(Activity, A) [5] of the ventilation noise with the aid of the PPS. They also 
identify the technique for analysing the association between the objective 
characteristics of ventilation noise and perceptual effects on other psy￾chological impacts, such as annoyance, discomfort, unpleasantness, and 
unacceptability.
6.5.1 Objective characteristics of ventilation noise
In the case study, 12 ventilation noise soundtracks were recorded in a uni￾versity classroom with dimensions of 8.4 m (L) × 7.4 m (W) × 3 m (H) 
(Figure 6.13). All classroom windows and doors were closed. To minimise 
the impact of other environmental noise instead of ventilation noise, only 
one experimenter was inside the classroom to control the advanced hand￾held analyser (Type 2270; Bruel & Kjaer (B&K), Naerum, Denmark) for 
soundtrack recording. Measurement points (MPs) 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 
and 6 are labelled as rows 1, 2, and 3 for the experiment, respectively. The 
flow direction in the air duct is from rows 1 to 3. Ventilation and cooling 
modes could be controlled by the control panel of the centralised ventilation Case studies and examples 131
system of the classroom (Figure 6.13(b)). For each soundtrack recording, 
the B&K Type 2270 sound analyser was placed at a height of 1.2 m (average 
seated ear height) from the ground surface (Figure 6.13(c)). The duration of 
each recording was 10 min. The first 4 min of the time-varying data of the 
A-weighted LAeq of recordings at the MPs is shown in Figure 6.14. In gen￾eral, the value of LAeq of noise in the ventilation mode exceeded than that 
Figure 6.14 First 4 min of time-varying data of A-weighted LAeq of 12 soundtracks recorded 
at 6 MPs in two operation modes.
Figure 6.13 (a) Floor plan of university classroom used for psychoacoustic study showing 
locations of MPs and air duct outlets; (b) on-site photo of university classroom; 
and (c) schematic of sound recording measurement using sound analyser.132 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
in the cooling mode. The LAeq value decreased along the airflow direction 
(from rows 1 to 3). As for the noise under the air duct outlet (MPs 1, 2, and 
3), the LAeq value exceeded those at MPs 4, 5, and 6.
Consistent results were found among the energy content-related acoustic 
metrics, such as LAeq, noise criteria (NC), noise rating (NR), and N
(Figure 6.15(a)–(d), respectively). The measurement of the spectral content￾related psychoacoustic metric, i.e., sharpness (S), showed that the change 
in spectral content was smaller along the airflow direction compared with 
that in operational modes (Figure 6.15(e)). A relatively high low-frequency 
component can be found for the noise in the cooling mode compared with 
that in the ventilation mode.
6.5.2 Psychological responses to ventilation noise
The jury listening test is a method for the subjective assessment of a subject’s 
responses to recorded soundtracks. The tests involved the playback of the 
soundtracks of ventilation noise in an anechoic chamber (Figure 6.16). The 
omnidirectional source, LS02, an amplified dodecahedron loudspeaker for 
playing the recorded soundtracks was placed 2 m away from the participants. 
A 1-kHz pure tone sound at 60 dB was used as the calibration signal. A B&K 
Type 2270 sound analyser was used to ensure that the magnitude of the cali￾bration signal heard at the location of the participants was 60 dB.

(cooling and ventilation) and rows.Case studies and examples 133
6.5.2.1 Psychoacoustics perception scale
The measurement of multidimensional psychological impacts was a 
self-administered questionnaire combining the PPS and other negative 
perceptions of sounds. Soundtracks extracted for 1 min were played during 
the jury listening test. The participants were asked to rate their responses to 
the nine psychological impacts proposed in the PPS (E dimension: ‘Quiet–
Noisy’, ‘Relaxed–Tense’, and ‘Pleasant–Unpleasant’; P dimension: ‘Weak–
Strong’, ‘Quiet–Loud’, and ‘Light–Heavy’; and A dimension: ‘Low–High’, 
‘Dull–Sharp’, and ‘Deep–Metallic’; and A2 and A3). The three other nega￾tive perceptions of sounds were ‘Comfortable–Uncomfortable’, ‘Pleasing–
Annoying’, ‘Calming–Stressful’, and ‘Acceptable–Unacceptable’. All the 
questions were on a semantic differential scale formed by a bipolar semantic 
pair with opposite meanings. For example, the semantic pair ‘Quiet–Noisy’ 
has seven levels. The perceptual responses, ‘Extremely Quiet’, ‘Quite Quiet’, 
‘Slightly Quiet’, ‘Equally Quiet/Noisy’, ‘Slightly Noisy’, ‘Quite Noisy’, and 
‘Extremely Noisy’, were rated from −3 to +3.
6.5.2.2 Letter cancellation task
The LCT is a paper-and-pencil test widely used to measure the attention of 
participants rapidly. A table of 23 random letters per row and 10 columns 
was provided to the participants in each jury listening test on a 1-min 
soundtrack. The participants were required to cancel all ‘A’ letters (a total 
Figure 6.16 (a) On-site photograph of anechoic chamber and schematic of jury listening 
test using PPS and LCT.134 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
of 40) on the table. The percentage of correct cancellations of ‘A’ letters was 
the attention score.
6.5.3 Statistical analysis
All data in the statistical analysis were coded and analysed using the com￾mercial package SPSS (version 23.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). All 
significance levels in the tests were set at 0.05. The Mann–Whitney U test 
was used to compare the differences among the psychological impacts of 
ventilation noise on participants in different operation modes. Moreover, 
Spearman’s rank correlation was applied to test the correlations between 
the objective characteristics of ventilation noise and multidimensional psy￾chological impacts or among the multidimensional psychological impacts.
6.5.3.1 Descriptive analysis of data
A total of 68 jury listening tests were conducted. Half of the tests involved 
ventilation noise in ventilation mode, whereas the other half involved noise 
in the cooling mode. Of the total participants, 64.7% were male, and 
35.3% were female. In general, the mean values of the negative psycho￾logical impact ratings were higher for ventilation noise (Figure 6.17). The 
participants felt significant tension due to the noise in the ventilation mode 
(mean ± standard derivation = 0.68 ± 1.04) than in the cooling mode (−0.06 
± 1.32). The results of objective characteristics in terms of LAeq, NC, NR, N, 
and S of ventilation noise showed that both the energy and spectral contents 
of the noise could be affected by the changes in the operation mode. The per￾ceptual influence of the change in objective properties was further assessed 
using the PPS. Higher scores in the E, P, and A dimensions indicate worse 
general judgement, higher sensitivity to noise magnitude, and greater sen￾sation to high frequencies of sounds, respectively. The measurement results 
of the PPS further quantified the perceptual impacts on occupants owing to 
the change in the operation mode. The noise with high magnitude and fre￾quency in the ventilation mode also affected the occupants’ perceptions of 
noise, especially for the ‘Tense’ perception (p < 0.05).
6.5.3.2 Data correlation analysis
In the analysis of psychological impacts on the E dimension, the negative 
impact on ‘Quiet–Noisy’ was found to be significantly correlated with all 
the acoustic and psychoacoustic metrics (ps < 0.05; Figure 6.18(a)). In the 
P dimension, all related negative impacts were found to be significantly 
correlated with the physical and psychoacoustic metrics of noise magnitude 
(ps < 0.05). However, there was no significant association between the psy￾chological impacts on the A dimension and objective metrics.Case studies and examples 135
In the analysis between the PPS and other psychological impacts, 
‘Comfortable–Uncomfortable’, ‘Pleasing–Annoying’, ‘Calming–Stressful’, 
and ‘Acceptable–Unacceptable’ were found to be significantly correlated 
with the psychological impacts on the E and P dimensions (ps < 0.001; 
Figure 6.18(b)). The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (0.65–0.80) 
between the other negative impacts and E dimension exceeded those of the 
P dimension (0.46–0.61).
The ability of PPS to capture hypothetical perceptual dimensions (E, 
P, and A) was further verified using the Spearman’s rank correlation test 
results. Evidently, the questions regarding the P dimension can quantify 
the increments of noise magnitude in terms of LAeq, NC, NR, and N (ps < 
0.05). The questions regarding E can quantify the general sound quality 
Figure 6.17 Psychological impacts of ventilation noise in different operation modes: (a) 
cooling mode and (b) ventilation mode (* p < 0.05 in Mann–Whitney U tests 
of variables in two operation modes).136 Noise and Vibration from Ventilation Systems
of ventilation noise with the change in both energy and spectral contents 
(LAeq, NC, NR, N, and S (ps < 0.05)). Because only ventilation noise was 
considered in this study, the participants could not differentiate the changes 
in temporal and spectral contents among the recorded sounds.
Furthermore, the scores of responses to the questions in the PPS were 
found to be excellent subjective indicators of other negative psychological 
impacts. The feelings of participants associated with ‘Uncomfortable’, 
‘Annoying’, ‘Stressful’, and ‘Unacceptable’ were significantly correlated 
with their responses to the E and P dimensions. A high Spearman’s rank 
correlation coefficient of responses to the questions in the E dimension 
indicated that the improvement in the general sound quality was more 
important than a mere reduction in noise magnitude. Excellent sound 
quality is not mere quiescence. Moreover, when PPS assessment is not 
implemented, the environmental impact of the annoyance of participants 
due to changes in the objective environment is not observed (i.e., the non￾significant results between objective characteristics and psychological 
impacts shown in Figure 16.8(a)). The foregoing demonstrates the neces￾sity for PPS assessment in the holistic psychoacoustic study of environ￾mental noise impacts.
Figure 6.18 Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (a) between objective characteristics 
of ventilation noise and psychological impacts and (b) among psychological 
impacts.Case studies and examples 137
For the analysis of the attention score from the LCT, ‘Quiet–Loud’ was 
found to be significantly correlated with the attention score of participants 
(Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, ρ = 0.29 (p < 0.05); Figure 6.19(a)). 
The participants had a higher attention score if they felt that the ventilation 
noise was quieter. After further grouping the participants into two (one 
group with an attention score of ≥75 and another group with an attention 
score of <75), the group with a high attention score was found to have posi￾tive perception (‘Slightly Quiet’ (Mean = −0.094)) of ventilation noise. Those 
with a low score had negative perception (‘Slightly Noisy’ (Mean = 0.69 and 
p < 0.05 in the Mann–Whitney U test of attention score between two partici￾pant groups); Figure 6.19(b)).
6.5.4 Significance of results
Successful and sustainable noise control requires knowledge of the multi￾dimensional psychological impacts of noise on occupants. The different 
applications of PPS provide reliable points of comparison between different 
acoustic and psychoacoustic studies in sustainable noise control designs. The 
PPS successfully recorded negative perceptual impacts in terms of dimensions 
other than noise magnitude. It is a more advanced approach compared 
with the traditional method, which only focuses on the participants’ per￾ception of noise loudness. Statistical analysis results show that the evalu￾ation of perceptual responses using the PPS is key to understanding the 
participants’ psychological responses (i.e., ‘Comfortable–Uncomfortable’, 
‘Pleasing–Annoying’, ‘Calming–Stressful’, and ‘Acceptable–Unacceptable’) 
to ventilation noise. The negative responses of participants were not only

influenced by the loudness sensation but also by the general judgement of 
noise. Furthermore, through the PPS, the use of psychoacoustic metrics N
and S to understand environmental noise impacts is demonstrated. The use 
of PPS can also aid in specifying the mechanism of environmental perceptual 
impacts on the attention of participants. These findings provide knowledge 
on creating a healthy and pleasant air-conditioned building environment 
by appropriately mitigating the multidimensional negative psychological 
impacts on occupants.
6.6 SUMMARY
The case studies presented in this chapter are step-by-step examples to dem￾onstrate how the knowledge presented in previous chapters can be applied 
to the prediction of duct transmission noise, flow-generated noise, vibra￾tion isolation performance, and human psychoacoustic responses. Such 
applications enable the resolution of real-life ventilation noise problems.
