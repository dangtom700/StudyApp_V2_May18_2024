Quantum Mechanics I
Quantum Mechanics I: The Fundamentals provides a graduate-level account of the behaviour 
of matter and energy at the molecular, atomic, nuclear, and sub-nuclear levels. It covers basic 
concepts, mathematical formalism, and applications to physically important systems.
This fully updated new edition addresses many topics not typically found in books at this level, 
including:
• Bound state solutions of quantum pendulum 
• Morse oscillator 
• Solutions of classical counterpart of quantum mechanical systems 
• A criterion for bound state 
• Scattering from a locally periodic potential and reflection-less potential 
• Modified Heisenberg relation 
• Wave packet revival and its dynamics 
• An asymptotic method for slowly varying potentials 
• Klein paradox, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox, and Bell’s theorem 
• Delayed-choice experiments 
• Fractional quantum mechanics 
• Numerical methods for quantum systems 
A collection of problems at the end of each chapter develops students’ understanding of both 
basic concepts and the application of theory to various physically important systems. This book, 
along with the authors’ follow-up Quantum Mechanics II: Advanced Topics, provides students 
with a broad, up-to-date introduction to quantum mechanics. Quantum Mechanics I

Index 581Preface
Quantum mechanics is the study of the behaviour of matter and energy at the molecular,
atomic, nuclear levels and even at sub-nuclear level. This book is intended to provide a
broad introduction to fundamental and advanced topics of quantum mechanics. Volume I
is devoted to basic concepts, mathematical formalism and application to physically impor￾tant systems. Volume II covers most of the advanced topics of current research interest in
quantum mechanics. Both the volumes are primarily developed as texts at the graduate
level and also as reference books. In addition to worked-out examples, numerous collection
of exercises are included at the end of each chapter. Solutions are available to confirmed
instructors upon request to the publisher. Some of the exercises serve as a mode of under￾standing and highlighting the significances of basic concepts while others form application
of theory to various physically important systems/problems. Developments made in recent
years on various mathematical treatments, theoretical methods, their applications and ex￾perimental observations are pointed out wherever necessary and possible and moreover they
are quoted with references so that readers can refer them for more details.
Volume I consists of 23 chapters and 7 appendices. Chapter 1 summarizes the needs for
the quantum theory and its early development (old quantum theory). Chapters 2 and 3 pro￾vide the basic mathematical framework of quantum mechanics. Schr¨odinger wave mechanics
and operator formalism are introduced in these chapters. Chapters 4 and 5 are concerned
with the analytical solutions of bound states and scattering states, respectively, of certain
physically important microscopic systems. The basics of matrix mechanics, Dirac’s notation
of state vectors and Hilbert space are elucidated in chapter 6. The next chapter gives the
Schr¨odinger, Heisenberg and interaction pictures of time evolution of quantum mechanical
systems. Description of time evolution of ensembles by means of density matrix is also de￾scribed. Chapter 8 is concerned with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. A brief account of
wave function in momentum space and wave packet dynamics are presented in chapters 9
and 10, respectively. Theory of angular momentum is covered in chapter 11. Chapter 12 is
devoted exclusively to the theory of hydrogen atom.
Chapters 13 through 16 are mainly concerned with approximation methods such as
time-independent and time-dependent perturbation theories, WKB method and variational
method. The elementary theory of elastic scattering is presented in chapter 17. Identical
particles are treated in chapter 18. The next chapter presents quantum theory of relativistic
particles with specific emphasize on Klein–Gordon equation, Dirac equation and its solution
for a free particle, a particle in a box (Klein paradox) and hydrogen atom.
Quantum mechanics has novel concepts like wave-particle duality, the uncertainty princi￾ple and wave function collapse due to measurement done. Chapter 20 examines the strange
consequences of role of measurement through the paradoxes of EPR and a thought ex￾periment of Schr¨odinger. A brief sketch of Bell’s inequality and the quantum mechanical
examples violating it are given. With reference to wave-particle duality modified double slit
experiments, referred as delayed-choice experiments, have been proposed and performed to
identify whether a microscopic particle decides to behave as a particle or wave at the slits
itself irrespective of the later path. These experiments and their outcomes are presented
in chapter 21. The next chapter introduces and covers the various features of fractional
xvxvi Preface
quantum mechanics where in the Schr¨odinger equation the space derivative or the time
derivative or both can be fractional.
Considering the rapid growth of numerical techniques in solving physical problems and
significances of simulation studies in describing complex phenomena, the final chapter is
devoted for a detailed description of numerical computation of bound state eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions, transmission and reflection probabilities of scattering potentials, transition
probabilities of quantum systems in the presence of external fields and electronic distribution
of atoms. Some supplementary and background materials are presented in the appendices.
The pedagogic features of volume I of the book, which are not usually found in textbooks
at this level, are the presentation of bound state solutions of Morse oscillator, quantum pen￾dulum, P¨oschl–Teller potential, damped and forced linear harmonic oscillator, solutions of
classical counter part of quantum mechanical systems considered, criterion for bound state,
scattering from a locally periodic potential and reflectionless potential, modified Heisenberg
relation, quaternionic quantum mechanics, wave packet revival and its dynamics, hydrogen
atom in D-dimension, alternate perturbation theories, an asymptotic method for slowly
varying potentials, Klein paradox, EPR paradox, Bell’s theorem, delayed-choice experi￾ments, fractional quantum mechanics and numerical methods for quantum systems.
The volume II consists of 16 chapters. Chapter 1 describes the basic ideas of both clas￾sical and quantum field theories. Quantization of nonrelativistic equation, electromagnetic
field, Klein–Gordon equation and Dirac field is given. The formulation of quantum mechan￾ics in terms of path integrals is presented in chapter 2. Application of it to free particle
and undamped and damped linear harmonic oscillators are considered. In chapter 3 some
illustrations and interpretation of supersymmetric potentials and partners are presented.
A simple general procedure to construct all the supersymmetric partners of a given quan￾tum mechanical systems with bound states is described. The method is then applied to a
few interesting system. A method to generate complex potentials with real eigenvalues is
presented. The next chapter is concerned with coherent and squeezed states. Construction
of these states and their characteristic properties are enumerated. Chapter 5 is devoted
to Berry’s phase, Aharonov–Bohm and Sagnac effects. Their origin, properties, effects and
experimental demonstration are presented. The features of Wigner distribution function are
elucidated in chapter 6.
In composite quantum systems, entanglement is a kind of correlation between subsys￾tems with no classical counterpart. The definition, detection, classification, quantification
and the application of quantum entanglement are covered in chapter 7. The next chapter
discusses the concept of quantum decoherence, its models, experimental studies on it and
its significance in the interpretation of quantum mechanics. There is a growing interest
on quantum computing. Basic aspects of quantum computing are presented in chapter 9.
Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm of finding whether a function is constant or not, Grover’s search
algorithm and Shor’s efficient quantum algorithm for integer factorization and evaluation of
discrete logarithms are described. Chapter 10 deals with quantum cryptography. Basic prin￾ciples of classical cryptography and quantum cryptography and features of a few quantum
cryptographic systems are discussed.
Chapter 11 presents no-cloning theorem concerned with the impossibility of copying a
quantum state without destroying the original state and the features of quantum cloning
machines. Learning the state of a quantum system by appropriate measurements is known
as quantum tomography. An overview of the relevant theory and techniques of quantum
tomography is provided in chapter 12. Simulating or emulating less controllable quantum
systems through some controllable quantum systems is the aim of quantum simulation.
Chapter 13 is devoted to the theoretical and experimental aspects of quantum simulation.
The next chapter is concerned with quantum error correction (QEC), which is foundational
in quantum computing and quantum information processing due to the presence of noisePreface xvii
and interaction of the systems with the environment and the measurement devices. Basic
ideas of QEC, setting and using of QEC codes and practical issues in the implementation
of QEC codes are covered.
A brief introduction to other advanced topics such as quantum gravity, quantum cosmol￾ogy, quantum Zeno effect, quantum teleportation, quantum games, quantum diffusion and
quantum chaos is presented in chapter 15. The last chapter gives features of some of the re￾cent technological applications of quantum mechanics. Particularly, promising applications
of quantum mechanics in ghost imaging, detection of weak amplitude objects and small
displacements, entangled two-photon microscopy, lithography, metrology, teleportation of
optical images and quantum sensors, batteries and internet are briefly discussed.
In the second edition of both the volumes, comprehensive revision of the chapters in
the first edition and extensive enlargement through the addition of two chapters in volume
I and six chapters in volume II have been made. Other chapters in the first edition are
updated by including the advancements witnessed in the past several years. Key revision
to the volume I includes new sections/subsections on Morse oscillator, damped and forced
linear harmonic oscillators, moments of linear harmonic oscillator, two-dimensional exactly
solvable systems, quaternionic quantum mechanics, condition for a wave function to possess
the minimum uncertainty product, wave packet revival of a particle in a box potential,
density matrix of a spin-1/2 system and two new chapters on delayed-choice experiments
and fractional quantum mechanics.
In volume II six new chapters on quantum entanglement, quantum decoherence, no￾cloning theorem and quantum cloning machines, quantum tomography, quantum simula￾tion and QEC are presented. Further, some notable newly added topics in other chap￾ters are application of path integral formulation to linearly damped systems, generation
of complex supersymmetric potentials with real eigenvalues, coherent states of position￾dependent mass systems, spin coherent states, Zak phase, cumulants with geometric phases,
Aharonov–Bohm effect in electrodynamics, testing quantum computers using Grover’s al￾gorithm, multi-photon and mult-stage protocol for cryptography, quantum cheque scheme,
quantum cosmology, quantum batteries, quantum sensors and quantum internet. Typo￾graphical errors occurred in the first edition of both the volumes are corrected in the second
edition.

Why Was Quantum Mechanics Developed?
1.1 Introduction
Quantum mechanics is the study of matter and radiation at an atomic level. It is a math￾ematical tool for predicting the behaviours of microscopic particles1
. Classical physics pro￾duced satisfactory results for systems that are much larger than atoms and moving with
much slower than the speed of light. But it failed for the systems with small size (atomic size)
or with speed near that of light. In the early 20th century, scientists observed that results
of certain experiments were not satisfactorily explained by classical physics. Particularly, it
failed to account for the observations in the following phenomena.
1. Black body radiation:
In the typical experiments with a black body, the energy emitted per unit time and
per unit wavelength at a temperature increases with increase in wavelength (λ),
reaches a maximum and then decreases. Classical theory gave incorrect variation
of emitted energy.
2. Photoelectric effect:
Electrons emission from a light illuminated metal surface happens only above a
threshold frequency of the incident light. This and other associated experimental
results were not accounted by the classical theory.
3. Spectrum of hydrogen:
Hydrogen atoms are found to emit radiations of certain wavelengths alone. But
classical theory predicted emission of radiations of all wavelengths.
4. X-ray scattering:
The experimentally observed results with X-ray scattering have not been satis￾factorily interpreted by the electromagnetic wave theory.
5. Variation of heat capacity at low temperatures:
Classically, the atomic heat of solids is 3R, a universal constant where R =
8.3 × 103 J · kilomole−1K−1
. In experiments it decreases and approaches to zero
as temperature T approaches 0 K.
In classical physics energy is a continuous variable. To obtain a radiation formula that fit
the experimental data, Max Karl Ludwig Planck, in 1901, proposed a revolutionary idea of
discrete energy levels of harmonic oscillators. He assumed that the absorption and emission
of electromagnetic radiation happen in discrete quanta. His formula agreed remarkably
with the experimental result. The importance of Planck’s idea was first appreciated by
Albert Einstein. He applied it to the photoelectric effect and specific heat. The results of

Einstein were subjected to experimental test by Robert Andrews Millikan, Louis Cesar
Victor Maurice de Broglie (the elder brother of Louis Victor Pierre Raymond de Broglie)
and others. Their observations established the validity of predictions of Einstein. Next, Niels
Henrik David Bohr applied the idea of Planck to the atomic structure and spectral lines.
He proposed that the electron in hydrogen atom moves in a circular orbit with angular
momentum assuming integral multiples of h/2π, where h = 6.626 × 10−34 J s is Planck
constant. In this way, Bohr connected h to the mechanics of the atom. The experiment of
James Franck and Gustav Hertz gave the striking evidence for Bohr’s postulate, namely,
atomic energy states are quantized and the amount of energy transfer to atomic electrons
is indeed discrete. Then Arthur Compton applied it to the scattering of X-rays. His results
were verified experimentally. In 1924 Louis de Broglie proposed that all matters exhibit
wave-like properties. The wave-particle duality is supported by electron diffraction with
crystals and double slit experiment. In this chapter, we briefly discuss the above historical
background of quantum theory.
1.2 Black Body Radiation
James Clerk Maxwell established that radiation is a wave made of electric and magnetic
fields and is characterized by its frequency ν and wavelength λ. At a given temperature,
different materials emit radiation of different wavelengths. A solid need not be so hot to
emit electromagnetic energy. In fact, all objects radiate energy continuously irrespective of
their temperatures. However, the predominate frequency depends on the temperature. Most
of the radiation at room temperature is in the invisible infrared part of the spectrum.
1.2.1 Black Body Spectrum
In 1859–1860 Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (grandfather of quantum theory) introduced the
concept of black body radiation. A black body is an object which absorbs and emits all the
radiation incident on it. It is difficult to realize a perfect black body. However, a closed oven
with a small hole is a good approximation to black body. Here, the radiation is admitted
through the hole. The entered radiation is totally absorbed due to repeated reflections inside
it. The radiation emitted can be studied using a spectrometer, and the spectral distribution
of the radiation can be obtained.
Suppose the walls of the black body are at a constant temperature T . Then a thermo￾dynamic equilibrium, a balance between emission and absorption of radiation, is reached.
The spectrum obtained can be characterized by E(ν, T ), where E(ν, T )dν is the energy
contribution by radiation per unit volume of the object in the interval ν to ν + dν. From
the thermodynamic arguments E(ν, T ) is shown to depend only on T . Since a black body
absorbs all frequencies, we expect that when heated it should radiate all frequencies. But,
experimentally, E(ν, T ) was found to be as shown in Fig. 1.1. Why does the black body spec￾trum have the shape shown in Fig. 1.1? Attempts were made to describe this by combining
the concepts of thermodynamics and electromagnetic theory.
1.2.2 The Stefan, Wien and Rayleigh–Jeans’ Laws
Kirchhoff proved that E must be E(ν, T ) and does not depend on the particular object. In
1879 Josef Stefan calculated the total energy density u(T ) of thermal radiation by adding
all frequencies and showed that it was ∝ T
4 and is known as Stefan’s fourth power-law ofBlack Body Radiation 3

. (1.1)
In 1884, Ludwig Boltzmann presented a proof of this result with the idea of pressure ex￾erted by the radiation. This law did not account correctly for the energy distribution in
the spectrum. In 1893, Wilheim Wien, through thermodynamic arguments, obtained the
empirical formula
E(ν, T ) = a ν3
e
−bν/T
, (1.2)
where a and b are constants. It explained the spectrum for high value of ν (visible and
ultraviolet regions) but not for low values of ν (infrared region). In 1900, Lord Rayleigh
argued that radiation consisted of modes of vibration. Applying the equipartition energy
theorem, he calculated the energy of each mode of vibration and the energy distribution.
His result after an amendment by James Jeans in the year 1905 read as
E(ν, T ) = 8πν2kBT

where kB is called Boltzmann constant (= RN −1

is the universal gas constant and N0 = 6 × 1026 atoms kilomole−1
) and
c is the velocity of light in vacuum. For the calculation of the value of kB see appendix A.
Equation (1.3) is the Rayleigh–Jeans’ law. It did a good job only for low frequencies and
failed at high frequencies. Further, it led to the total energy in the spectrum as
Z ∞

8πkBT

dν = ∞ . (1.4)
The spectrum diverges at high frequencies. Paul Ehrenfest called this phenomenon ultra￾violet catastrophe. This divergence was not observed experimentally. The disagreement of
theoretical predictions with the experimental observation hinted that certain basic assump￾tions of classical physics were somehow wrong.
1.2.3 Planck’s Radiation Formula
Max Planck [1] thought that the assumptions on which Wien’s and Rayleigh–Jeans’ laws
were derived might be incorrect. He assumed that the assumption of continuous emission
of radiation in classical mechanics led to incorrect predictions. Therefore, he made the
following assumptions:4 Why Was Quantum Mechanics Developed?
1. Changes of energy in radiators happen discontinuously and discretely.
2. The walls of the black body are made of harmonic oscillators. They have discrete
energies En = nhν, where h is Planck constant2
, n = 0, 1, . . .. (This is the origin
of the concept of quantization.) That is, the oscillators have only discrete values
of energy and are integral multiples of hν. (In the words of Born in this postu￾late, there is an absurdity. Here the energy is that of a localized particle, while
frequency ν is usually associated with a wave.)
3. The distribution of oscillators in discrete energy states is governed by the Boltz￾mann distribution law3

2This is first occurrence of Planck constant in quantum mechanics. It appears in all quantum phenomena.
It occurs in angular momentum, spin, momentum, commutator relations, Heisenberg uncertainty relation,
etc. We cannot speak of quantum mechanics without h. h is the ratio of the frequency of radiation and the
size of the quanta (h = 4.2 × 10−15 eV or h = 6.626 × 10−34 J s). For a determination of h from black body
radiation refer refs. [2–5]. Also see appendix A.

becomes
E(ν, T ) = 8πν2
c

hν
e
hν/kBT − 1
. (1.14)
This is Planck’s radiation formula.
Planck’s formula agreed remarkably with the experiments. At low frequencies, hν ≪
kBT , (1.14) becomes the Rayleigh–Jeans’ law (1.3). Planck’s discovery led to the formulation
of quantum mechanics. Planck received Nobel Prize for physics for the year 1918 for his
work. Satyendra Nath Bose derived Planck’s law by considering photons as indistinguishable
particles obeying Bose–Einstein statistics. His derivation is presented in appendix C.
We note that the size of the energy quanta is proportional to the frequency. Radiation of
low frequencies is easy to generate because it needs only small quanta of energy. But for high
frequencies radiation requires large amounts of energy. This accounts the explanation for the
spectrum of black body radiation. It is easy to verify that the ultraviolet catastrophe does
not occur in Planck’s formula. In the limit ν → ∞, the exponential term in the denominator
of Eq. (1.14) diverges much faster than ν
3
in the numerator and E → 0.
Planck’s idea of discrete energy of a harmonic oscillator implies that the frequencies for
the absorbed and emitted radiation should be discrete. According to classical physics, a
system can absorb or emit any amount of energy. In contrast, in the work of Planck the
energy emitted by an oscillator is discrete or quantized. Planck coined the term quanta for
the packets of energy. Bohr in 1913 proposed that like Planck’s oscillator, atoms can exist
only in certain energy states. Essentially, in classical physics energy is a continuous variable
while in the new theory it is quantized. Quantization of energy and certain other quantities
such as angular momentum and spin in the new theory led to the name quantum physics
or quantum mechanics. Max Born coined the term quantum mechanics.
1.3 Photoelectric Effect
The electrons emitted in the photoelectric effect are called photoelectrons, and the current
formed by them is called photoelectric current. The substance exhibiting photoelectric effect
is said to be photoemissive. The effect was discovered first by Willoughby Smith in 1873. In
1839, Alexandre Edmond Becquerel observed the photoelectric effect with an electrode in a
conductive solution exposed to light. In 1887 Heinrich Rudolf Hertz noticed the photoelectric
effect in his experiments with a spark-gap generator. Hertz observed an increase in the
sensitivity of the device when it was illuminated with ultraviolet or visible light. In 1897
Joseph John Thomson (Nobel Prize in 1906) showed that the observed increased sensitivity
was because of the emission of electrons from the cathode by the incident light. Nikola
Tesla described the photoelectric effect in 1901. He regarded such radiations as vibrations
of aether of short wavelengths which ionized the atmosphere.
In 1902 Phillip Edward Anton Von Lenard (Nobel Prize in 1905), an assistant of Hertz,
studied photoelectric effect. His setup consisted of a photocell connected to a circuit with
a power supply, voltmeter and micro-ammeter. He illuminated the photoemissive surface
with light of different frequencies and intensities. He found that the kinetic energy of the6 Why Was Quantum Mechanics Developed?
emitted electron was independent of the intensity. Classically, if a plate was illuminated
with a high-intensity light, then the emitted photoelectron should have higher energy.
1.3.1 A Typical Experimental Study
We give briefly a typical experimental study and the common outcomes of the photoelectric
effect. Consider a vacuum tube with two electrodes connected to a variable voltage source.
Suppose a light incident on the surface of a cathode in the vacuum tube. The electrons
released from the metal surface arrive at the other electrode and give rise the flow of
current I in the circuit. There would be no flow of current until the potential difference
V between the anode and the cathode is raised to a critical value, say, V0. When V is
increased beyond V0 the current I would increase and reach a limiting value Is called the
saturation photoelectric current. At I = Is all the electrons that escaped from the cathode
would reach the anode. The following are some of the important striking observations with
the photoelectric effect.
1. Photoelectric effect occurs when the frequency of the incident light is greater than
a certain frequency ν0 called threshold frequency. ν0 differs from metal to metal.
2. The kinetic energy of the photoelectrons emitted increases with increase in fre￾quency, however, remains constant on further increasing the intensity of light.
3. Flow of photoelectric current takes place only above a certain critical applied
voltage V0.
4. The intensity of the incident light has no influence on the maximum kinetic
energy of the photoelectrons. But the number of particles emitted decreases with
decrease in the intensity of incident light. The velocity of the emitted particles
remain the same.
5. There is no delay between absorption of the incident light energy and the emission
of photoelectrons. Classically, the electrons would require a certain time to absorb
sufficient energy to escape.
The above results were completely unexpected. These observations were not explained by
classical physics. Einstein solved these mysteries in 1905 [6].
1.3.2 Einstein’s Photoelectric Equation
In 1905, Albert Einstein wrote a paper on photoelectric effect. (In the same year he
wrote his paper on the special theory of relativity.) He proposed that light is absorbed
by matter in discrete quanta of electromagnetic radiation that were later called pho￾tons5
. The electromagnetic radiation itself is quantized. All photons of monochromatic
light have the same energy Eph = hν = hc/λ, where λ is the wavelength of the light.
Here Eph is the energy of the photon (a particle property) and ν is its frequency (a
wave property). A conduction electron gets energy hν by absorbing a photon. The elec￾tron uses this energy to overcome the binding energy in the metal and to raise its kinetic
energy.
Let us denote φ0 as the minimum energy required to impart to an electron to escape it
from a metal. φ0 is called work function because it is the work done by a photoelectron to
escape from the metal. It is h times the critical frequency. The conservation of energy here
5The term photon was coined by the chemist Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1926 [7].Photoelectric Effect 7
is
hν =
1
2
mv2
max + φ0 , (1.15)
where m and vmax are the mass and maximum velocity of a photoelectron, respectively.
When a photon of energy hν strikes an atom, hν − φ0 amount of energy is available for
imparting kinetic energy (K) to an electron. Then
Kmax =
1
2
mv2
max = |e|V0 = hν − φ0 . (1.16)
The above equation is called Einstein’s photoelectric equation.
The notable features of Einstein’s equation are:
1. Kmax = 0 when ν = ν0 = φ0/h. If ν < ν0 (or hν < φ0) the incident photon will
not have sufficient energy to remove the electron from the metal surface. Hence,
there exists a threshold frequency (corresponding to Kmax = 0) of the incident
photon above which only the photoelectric effect occurs.
2. Kmax, vmax and V0 depend only on the frequency of the incident light and φ0.
They are independent of the intensity of the incident light. By considering the
instantaneous absorption of light, we account for observed instantaneous emission
of photoelectrons.
The above features explained the experimental facts not explained by classical theory. For
his work on photoelectric effect Einstein won the Nobel Prize in 1922.
Experiments have been conducted by Robert Andrews Millikan (Nobel Prize in 1923),
Arthur Llewelyn Hughes, Owen Willans Richardson (Nobel Prize in 1928), Arthur Holly
Compton and Maurice de Broglie to verify Einstein’s photoelectric equation. Their exper￾iments at both low and high frequencies ranges confirmed the validity of the equation.
Though the predictions of the model were verified by Millikan and others it did not attract
interest immediately. This is because the particle model of photon does not explain wave
effects. Only when Compton in 1923 verified that X-rays were scattered by electrons as
if they were particles the Einstein’s model got great interest. The photoelectric effect led
to the invention of photoelectric cells, photomultipliers, photovoltaic cells and the image
sensors in digital cameras.
In the photoelectric effect, energy is transferred to electrons from photons. Is the inverse
process, that is, conversion of a part of kinetic energy of a electron into a photon possible?
An energetic electron passing through matters will loss a part of its kinetic energy in the form
of photons. The process by which an electron emits photons is called bremsstrahlung6
. The
inverse photoelectric effect was observed by Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen in 1895. He found
that a highly penetrating radiation (later called X-rays) is produced when fast electrons
impinge on matter. He received Nobel Prize in 1902 for the discovery of X-rays.
Solved Problem 1:
When a light of wavelength 210 nm falls on a metal surface the measured kinetic energy
(K.E.) of ejected electrons is 1.914 eV. When a light of 250 nm falls on the same metal
surface the maximum kinetic energy is 0.968 eV. Find the value of hc and the work function
of the metal.
The photoelectric equation is K.E. = hν − φ0 = (hc/λ) − φ0. For λ = 210 nm and K.E. =
1.914 eV the above equation is

1.4 Hydrogen Spectrum
Classical mechanics failed to explain the stability of a nuclear atom and the existence of
spectral lines. Consider a hydrogen-like atom with electron of mass me and charge −e at
a distance r from the nucleus of mass M and the charge Ze. The force between proton
and electron is electrostatic and is (Coulomb interaction) −(1/4πǫ0)Ze2/r2
, where ǫ0 =
8.85 × 10−12 C
2N−1m−2
is the permittivity of free space. Due to the Coulomb force the
electron will move towards the nucleus and collide with it in a fraction of second. We know
that this is not happening.
To stabilize the atom assume that the electron is orbiting the nucleus like the planets
orbiting the sun. In a planetary system the motion of the planets and the centrifugal force
prevents them colliding with the sun under the influence of gravity. With this analogy,
Niels Bohr assumed that the electrons move along circular orbits around the nucleus. The
Coulomb force gives a centrifugal acceleration of the electron given by v
2/r, where v is the
velocity of the electron. The centrifugal force is F = mv2/r, where m = meM/(me + M)
is the reduced mass and the Coulomb force is (1/4πǫ0)Ze2/r2
. The reduced mass is used
because the motion of the electron is considered as relative to the centre-of-mass of the
atom. In the orbit, these forces are balanced so that

. (1.23)
Classically, r can take any positive value and therefore E can take any value in the interval
[−∞, 0]. An accelerated charge will emit electromagnetic radiation. Since the electron is
revolving around the nucleus it will emit radiation. The emission will reduce the energy of the
electron. Hence, the radius of the electron orbit will decrease. The frequencies of the emitted
radiation will be continuous. Therefore, we must get a continuous spectrum. Further, theHydrogen Spectrum 9
electron will spiral inside the nucleus and become unstable. But the experimentally observed
energy spectrum is discrete and an atom is stable.
To explain the discrete spectrum of hydrogen, in 1914 Bohr [8] extended the discreteness
of energy to atom and postulated that emission of radiation occurs when the atom jumps
from a higher energy state Ei to a lower energy state Ef and the frequency of the emitted
radiation is
ν = (Ei − Ef ) /h . (1.24)
Further, he assumed that an electron moves only in certain allowed orbits called stationary
states with the orbital angular momentum7 mvr equal to an integer times ~ = h/2π:
mvr = nh/(2π) = n~ , n = 1, 2, . . . . (1.25)
Notice the presence of Planck constant in the above equation. (Here onwards we use ~ in
place of h/2π). When the condition (1.25) holds, the electron does not radiate energy and
the orbit is stable. That is, according to Bohr, atoms in the above-allowed orbits remain
in them and could not radiate. There is a minimum angular momentum determining the
closest orbit to the nucleus. Consequently, the electron cannot get into the nucleus. From
Eq. (1.25) we have mv2 = n

2/(mr2
). Comparison of this with Eq. (1.22) gives

Since n is discrete, the energy levels of the hydrogen atom are thus discrete. Why is the
energy < 0? What does the negative sign of En imply?

Rydberg in 1890. Equation (1.29) gives the frequencies of all transitions in the hydrogen
atom. In this way Bohr accounted for the spectrum of hydrogen. Bohr shared the 1922
Nobel Prize (with Einstein) for his work on the investigation of the structure of atoms and
of the radiation coming from them. The formula (1.30) with n = 2 was proposed few years
earlier by Johann Jakob Balmer.

In 1925 de Broglie gave an explanation for non-decay of an electron from a Bohr orbit.
He hypothesized that electrons have wavelengths. If the wavelength of an electron orbiting a
nucleus is an integral multiple of ~ (length of the orbit), a standing electron wave results. de
Broglie’s equation is nλ = 2πr, n = 1, 2, . . .. Then the quantization of angular momentum
means
nλ = 2πr =
2πn~

Thus, λ = h/(mv) = h/p.
Although the theory of Bohr was developed for hydrogen atom it was successful for
hydrogen-like ions such as He+, Li++ which consist of a charged nucleus and a single
orbiting electron. However, there were several unanswered questions. For example, some of
the spectral lines have fine structures. Difficulties arose when the theory was extended to
complex atoms. The model failed to account the effect of a magnetic field on the radiation
emitted by certain atoms. It couldn’t account for the intensities of the spectral lines.
1.5 Franck–Hertz Experiment
In 1914 James Franck and Gustav Hertz [9] studied experimentally the impact of electrons
on atoms. They observed that electrons moving through mercury vapour with an energy
equal to or greater than a critical value near 4.9 eV excited the 2536 ˚A line of the mercury
spectrum. Their experiment supported the discrete energy states of atoms proposed by
Bohr, and for this the 1925 Nobel Prize was awarded to Franck and Hertz.
The experimental apparatus [9–11] consisted of a glass tube with mercury vapour and
an electrode. A grid was placed between the anode and cathode. Electrons emitted from
cathode were accelerated toward a positively charged grid by a voltage V . Acceleration
gave kinetic energy to the electrons. This energy can be stated in electron volts (eV). For
example, an electron accelerated by 5 V will have 5 eV of kinetic energy. A small potential
difference V0 between the grid and the anode disallowed electrons with energies lower than a
certain minimum amount reaching the anode. An ammeter connected to the anode measured
the flow of current. Franck and Hertz measured the current by changing the accelerating
voltage.
In the experiment, as the voltage increased from zero the current increased. At about
4.9 V the current decreased sharply indicating the occurrence of a new phenomenon wherein
much energy of electrons were taken away. Consequently, the electrons were unable to reach
the anode. Essentially, inelastic collisions took place between the atomic electrons of the
mercury atoms and the accelerated electrons. The increase of current up to 4.9 V implied
that energy less than 4.9 eV was not absorbed by the mercury. Electrons with energy less
than 4.9 eV bounced elastically when they collided with mercury atoms and unable to excite
electromagnetic radiation.
The result of Franck–Hertz experiment is explained based on Bohr’s idea of quantized
energy levels. The energy of first excited state of mercury is 4.9 eV. If the kinetic energy of
accelerated electron is lower than 4.9 eV then the available energy becomes insufficient to
excite an electron of mercury to next higher energy and thus no absorption of energy. When
the kinetic energy of an electron is, say, at least 4.9 eV then it would able to transfer 4.9 eV
to an electron in mercury. The mercury can absorb this specific quanta of energy. Now, an
electron of mercury jumps to the first excited state and at the same time the electron that
has lost 4.9 eV is unable to reach the collector. Consequently, the current is reduced.Stern–Gerlach Experiment 11
In the experiment, when the accelerating voltage was raised just above 4.9 V, the mercury
atoms absorbed only 4.9 eV. Hence, the electrons had much energy to reach the anode. The
current started increasing steadily. At 9.8 V a second decrease in the current was noticed.
At this voltage an electron with energy 9.8 eV lost 4.9 eV because of collision with one
mercury atom. This electron moved with the energy of 4.9 eV. When this electron collided
with another mercury atom it lost the remaining 4.9 eV. The electrons lost all their 4.9 eV
by two inelastic collisions and excited two mercury atoms. Then the electrons were with
zero kinetic energy. As a result the current dropped. The above process repeated at intervals
of 4.9 V and each time the electrons underwent one more inelastic collision.
Drops in the current occurred at multiples of 4.9 V. This is an indication that the atoms
absorbed energy only in specific amounts–quanta! In this process the atomic electrons made
an abrupt transition to a discrete higher energy state. If the hitting electrons had energy
less than the energy 4.9 eV then no energy was absorbed by the atomic electrons and hence
no transition. When they had this specific quanta of energy they lost it to the electrons
of mercury. The absorbed energy got stored in the electron excited to higher states. This
energy was released as a photon when the electrons came back to the lowest energy state
(ground state).
As described above the Franck–Hertz experiment confirmed quantized model of Bohr
by demonstrating that atoms could only absorb specific amount of energy, namely those
quantities which transfer the atom from one state to another stationary state.
Solved Problem 2:
Atomic hydrogen is bombarded with electrons in a Franck–Hertz type experiment. Excita￾tion potentials of 10.21 V and 12.10 V are measured, and three spectral lines are found in
the emission spectrum. Compute the wavelengths of these spectral lines.

hc

where q is a generalized coordinate and p is the corresponding canonically conjugate mo￾mentum. This condition is satisfied for periodic motion, and the integral is taken over one
period. Orbits with a specific direction for the angular momentum vector were alone consid￾ered. There is a further degeneracy with the various orientations for an angular momentum
vector L with respect to any fixed axis. The angular momentum component parallel to the
axis must be m~ with the quantum number m taking integer values only. This is called
space quantization. When l is the quantum number characterizing the magnitude of the
angular momentum then m = −l, −l + 1, . . . , l − 1, l.
The first evidence of space quantization was shown experimentally by Otto Stern and
Walther Gerlach in 1922 [13]. They demonstrated the magnetic nature of the electron.
Suppose a beam of electrons is allowed to pass through a region where the magnetic field
points in the z-direction. The strength of field increases with z. Such a field would make a
pull upward on the south pole but downward on the north pole of the equivalent magnet of
the electron. The total force on the electron will depend on its orientation. If the south pole
of the electron is much higher in the field then the force will be upward. When its north
pole is higher then the total force will be downward. Hence, an electron moving through this
region would experience a downward or upward deflecting force and is directly proportional
to Sz (the projection of its spin angular momentum8 on the z-axis).
If we send an electron beam through a region with a magnetic field of the above sys￾tem, then the upward or downward forces on the electrons will make the beam to fan-out
vertically. The vertical position of an electron, on a display screen, can be used as a direct
measurement of Sz of that electron. Because of the random orientation of the incoming
electrons we expect the electrons be at the screen to be with a continuous range of vertical
positions. But in the experiment electrons were found to reach at only two positions as
shown in Fig. 1.2. This implied that Sz could have one of the two possible values. The spin
is thus quantized.
The point is that the beam is bent by the field into two paths: one above and one below
the z-axis. The force in the z-direction on a particle is Fz = µz∂Bz/∂z, where µz is the
z-component of the magnetic moment. The separation of beams means that µz takes on
two equal but opposite values. The atoms from the source are with their magnetic moments
oriented at random, but when entered the field they take one of the two values in the
z-direction. Because of the relationship between µz and Lz (z-component of the orbital
angular momentum), Lz can take only one value. For a given value of the orbital quantum
8The spin is usually said to be non-orbital, intrinsic or inherent angular momentum. For more details

number l, there are 2l+1 values of the z-component. Here the two values of the z-component
means l = 1/2, which is in disagreement with l an integer. George Eugene Uhlenbeck and
Samuel Abraham Goudsmit suggested that the electron has an intrinsic angular momentum
(spin) with two values of the z-component ±1/2.
If the electron is like a spinning ball, then its collisions with other electrons would
give spin angular momentum with different magnitudes. Hence, more than two parts could
occur. But this is not observed. Thus, the spin of an electron appears as one of its intrinsic
characteristics like mass or charge.
1.7 Correspondence Principle
Bohr investigated the passage of α-particles in matter and studied the processes of ionization
of the atoms. The classical ideas failed. Bohr thought that the new theory (quantum theory)
should match with the classical theory for low frequencies or large quantum numbers. This
led to the famous correspondence principle. This principle is of great interest in statistical
mechanics and electrodynamics. It played a significant role in the early formulation of
quantum theory [14,15].
Planck stated that
lim
h→0
[quantum physics] = [classical physics] . (1.36)
He illustrated this principle through the observation that (1.14) reduced to the classical
Rayleigh–Jeans’ law (1.3) in the limit h → 0. He stated: The classical theory can simply be
characterized by the fact that the quantum of action becomes infinitesimally small. Another
form of this principle was given by Paul Ehrenfest and is known as Ehrenfest’s theorem
which will be discussed in the next chapter.
In the year 1913, Bohr observed that the frequency spectrum emitted by a hydrogen
atom approaches the classical spectrum in the limit of large principal quantum number n.
The emission frequency in this limit is the orbiting of the electron classical frequency which
approach zero as n → ∞. This is called Bohr frequency correspondence principle. This is
obtained when the quantum spectrum coalesces with that of the classical.
Let us illustrate the correspondence principle [14,15] for linear harmonic oscillator and
hydrogen atom. In Planck’s idea energy of harmonic oscillator is discrete, while in classical
mechanics it is continuous. To understand this difference we calculate ∆E/E for any two
adjacent energy levels of linear harmonic oscillator. Since En = (n + 1/2) ~ω, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(see sec. 4.4) the quantity ∆E/E corresponding to n and n + 1 levels is

In the limit of n → ∞, we get limn→∞(∆E)/E → 0. This is in agreement with the corre￾spondence principle.
In hydrogen atom the force on the electron due to the nucleus is F = −(1/4πǫ0)e

This gives the centripetal force to the electron to follow a circular orbit. The radial accel￾eration is ar = v

Bohr predicted νBohr coincides with νc for large n. This led to the correspondence principle:
For large quantum numbers the state of a system is governed by the laws of classical physics
and we ignore the quantum effects. The results of quantum mechanics in the limit of large
quantum numbers and h → 0 must be same as that of classical mechanics.
The limit n → ∞ and h → 0 are not the same. Let us point out an example [15]. The
energies of a particle of mass m bounded to a cubical box with impenetrable walls of length

In the limit h → 0, νn+1 → νn. h → 0 leads to frequency correspondence but the limit

1.8 Compton Effect
The Franck–Hertz experiment gave an evidence of discrete energy levels of atoms. The
particle nature of radiation is established by the Compton effect. In 1923, both theoreti￾cally and experimentally, Arthur Holly Compton (Nobel Prize in 1927) showed that during
propagation electromagnetic radiation manifests as a stream of particles (photons) [1Compton Effect 15

FIGURE 1.3
Scattering of a photon by an electron.
Let us consider a collision between an electron and a photon. Assume that an X-ray
photon of frequency ν and energy E(= hν) is made to strike a stationary electron. The
photon is scattered, and the electron gets an impulse and moves as shown in Fig. 1.3.
Classical theory of X-ray scattering predicts the following:
1. The wavelength of a scattered photon should have a continuous values.
2. The wavelength of incident and scattered photons are the same.
3. Scattering occurs in all directions.
But experimental observations have shown discrepancy from the above results. Compton
noticed that when X-rays were scattered by a graphite block the scattered radiation had
a longer wavelength in addition to the original wavelength. Further, the longer wavelength
component was found to increase with increase in the scattering angle. Considering the
scattering as a result of an elastic collision of two particles (photon and electron) Compton
accounted the experimental results.
In the scattering process shown in Fig. 1.3, the kinetic energy of the scattered electron
has to be from the incident photon. Therefore, the energy Esp of the scattered photon is
lower than Eip, the incident photon energy. Thus, the frequency ν
′ of the scattered photon
is lower than the frequency ν of the incident photon. The kinetic energy gained by the
scattered electron is thus hν − hν′
.
In the collision process momentum must be conserved in the direction of the incident
photon as well as in the direction perpendicular to it. The momenta of the photon and
the electron before collision are p = hν/c and 0, respectively. After collision they become
p
′ = hν′/c and P, respectively. From Fig. 1.4 we write the equations of conservation of
momenta.

The shift in the wavelength △λ of the scattered photon is from its collision with the electron

classical physics. △λ depends on h, c, me and φ. The shift in the wavelength when the

From the above analysis the following conclusions were drawn:
1. Equation (1.55) shows that λ
′ of the scattered radiation (photon) is greater than
that of the incident photon.
2. △λ is independent of the wavelength of the incident photon and the nature of
the target but depends on the angle of scattering.
3. The relation between θ and φ, Eq. (1.59), shows that as φ increases from 0 to π,
θ decreases from π/2 to 0. That is, the photon is scattered in all directions while
the target electron is scattered only in the forward direction.
4. From Eq. (1.56) we write mec
2 = hc/λc = hνc. Therefore, λc is the wavelength of
the light produced if the energy of the electron is converted into a light quanta.
5. Here p (or p
′
) is a particle property while λ is a wave property. There is a para￾dox in Compton’s experiment: Light manifests both particle-like and wave-like
properties.
Soon after Compton’s theoretical work, several scientists including Compton himself carried
out experiments with X-rays. Their results confirmed Compton’s predictions.

1.9 Specific Heat Capacity
Due to thermal agitations, atoms in solids oscillate about their mean positions. When each
atom is considered as a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator then its average thermal
energy should be 3kBT , where kBT is that of one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Then
the thermal energy of a solid becomes 3kBT per atom or 3RT = 3N kBT per gram-atom,
where N is the Avogadro number. The rate of increase of thermal energy with T , per gram￾atom (called atomic heat or specific heat) becomes 3R (= 3 × 8.3 × 103 J · kilomole−1K−1
),
a universal constant. This was confirmed experimentally in solids at normal temperatures.
But for sufficiently lower temperature, the specific heat decreases and approach to zero as
T → 0K. In order to explain this, Einstein [17] assumed that the energy of an atom in a
solid takes only a discrete set of values: the energy of each component of oscillation is nhν,
n = 0, 1, . . .. The mean energy per atom is obtained as
hE(ν)i =
hν

C given by the above equation decreases with decrease in T . The variation of specific heat

1.10 de Broglie Waves
According to special theory of relativity mass and energy are equivalent. Therefore, electro￾magnetic waves and electrons are considered as different forms of energy. Electromagnetic
waves possess particle properties. When the postulates of Planck and Einstein shown that
electromagnetic wave posses particle properties, at that time, wave properties of particles
were not observed. To have a symmetrical picture Louis de Broglie, a young French prince,
in his doctorate thesis (1924), attached waves to all moving particles [18]. For his idea of
matter waves he was awarded the Nobel Prize in the year 1929.
The matter waves proposed by de Broglie are called de Broglie waves. To know the
wavelength of a de Broglie wave, let us attach a periodic travelling wave with a moving
particle. Denote the wave solution as φ and let it be a0 sin(2πν0t0), where a0 is the amplitude
and ν0 is the frequency observed by an observer at rest with respect to the particle. Suppose
the particle’s speed is v along the x-axis. Then taking according to the time-dilation
t0 =
t − (βx/c)

we have

Now, the (de Broglie)wavelength λ is u/ν = h/p. λ depends on m and speed of the particle.
It is shorter if the particle moves faster. The angular frequency ω and the wave number k

Evidently, the de Broglie wavelength is extremely small for ordinary objects like bullets and
balls because of the extreme smallness of h (= 6.626×10−34 J s). For example, a cricket ball
of 100 g travelling with a speed 120 km/h have a de Broglie wavelength of 1.9878× 10−34 m
which is too small to be detectable. But for an electron accelerated through 150 V, the de
Broglie wavelength is λ =
p
150/V × 10−8
cm = 1 ˚A which is significant in atomic scale.
We note that matter waves are quite different from electromagnetic waves. The latter in
vacuum always travels with velocity 3×108 m/s while the former do not. de Broglie formula
has found several applications. The wavelength of electrons at high speed or high energy is
much smaller than those of visible light. Because of this electron microscope have relatively
much higher resolutions than those of optical microscopes.

1.11 Particle Diffraction
Compton effect shows that light behaves like particles when it collides with electrons. Can
a particle exhibit a wave phenomenon, supporting matter waves concept? In 1927 Clinton
Joseph Davisson, Lester Halbert Germer [19] and George Paget Thomson9
[20] indepen￾dently observed the wave nature of particles in their experiments with diffraction of a
particle with a single crystal. Then Arthur Jeffrey Dempster in 1927 and Immanuel Es￾termann and Otto Stern in 1930 obtained diffraction effects with hydrogen and helium by

character. His son George Paget Thomson received Nobel Prize for showing electron behaves as a wave.20 Why Was Quantum Mechanics Developed?
reflecting them from crystal gratings. The results of their experiments could be explained
only by attributing wave-like character to microscopic particles.
According to classical physics the scattered electrons move in all directions with a mod￾erate dependence of their intensity on angle of scattering and less on the energy of the
incident electrons. These results were verified by Davisson and Germer using the target as
a polycrystalline nickel solid. They heated the nickel to a high temperature and then cooled
it. They got a single crystal with the atoms arranged in a regular lattice. They measured
the intensity of scattering in various directions. The intensity of scattering increased from
zero in the plane of the target to a highest value in co-latitude 20◦
. When the co-latitude
and the bombarding potential were fixed and measurement was done in azimuth angle, they
observed a variation in the intensity of scattering. At 40 V a slight hump occurred near 60◦
in the co-latitude curve for azimuth 111. This hump then developed rapidly with increasing
voltage into a strong spur. The spurs were due to scattered electrons. At 54 V and co-latitude
50◦
the graph of intensity of scattered electron with azimuth angle was shown a series of
maxima and minima. When the incident electron beam was replaced by a monochromatic
X-rays, phenomena noticed with the electron were observed. If the electrons were particles
then the above result cannot be explained. Thus, the experiment of Davisson and Germer
shown that a beam of electrons possesses wave-like characteristics. According to de Broglie
hypothesis the electron waves were diffracted by the single crystal.
The de Broglie wavelength λ of the diffracted electrons obtained from nλ = 2d sin θ
agreed with the electron wavelength λ = h/(mv), thereby verifying the wave nature of mov￾ing bodies. Beams of neutrons, hydrogen atom and helium atom have produced diffraction
patterns.
The wave properties of electrons are utilized in many practical ways. For example, in an
electron microscope, electrons replace waves due to their shorter wavelengths compared to
visible light and thus able to resolve much finer detail. Further, electron and neutron wave
effects are useful to investigate defects in metals. A beam of neutron waves directed towards
a target nuclei can be tuned in frequency to resonate with the natural interval frequencies
of the nuclei.
1.12 Wave-Particle Duality
In classical mechanics, we have two types of phenomena: waves and particles. As we know
waves spread in space and carry energy with them but do not transport mass. In contrast,
particles are localized and have both energy and mass. In quantum mechanics these dif￾ferences are unclear. In certain cases objects thought of as particles behave like waves. In
some cases waves behave like particles. For example, the photoelectric effect can only be
explained if the light has a particle nature. On the other hand, electrons can give rise to
wave-like diffraction patterns. As suggested by de Broglie, all objects have both particle and
wave aspects. The different aspects manifest according to the type of process it undergoes.
This is known as the principle of wave-particle duality. In this section, we demonstrate it
by considering the famous Young’s double-slit experiment.
In 1803, Thomas Young (1773–1829) demonstrated that when a light beam passes
through two narrow slits, the waves coming out from these slits interfere with one anotherWave-Particle Duality 21

and produce interference patterns on a photographic plate10. This experiment exemplifies
the wave and particle nature of light.
Here, we take up three experiments similar in concept with a double slit [22, 23]. Suppose
a light is sent to a screen through a double slit (Fig. 1.5). A photographic film on the screen
is used to extract information created by the incident light. We consider the following three
cases:
1. Slit-1 (upper slit) is opened while slit-2 (lower slit) is closed.
2. Slit-2 is opened and slit-1 is closed.
3. Both the slits are opened.
Image patterns are recorded on photographic film for each experiment. If we measure the
intensity of the light on the film we get the results as indicated in Fig. 1.6. When slit-1 or
slit-2 alone is opened there is no interference. When both the slits are opened we observe an
interference pattern with maxima and minima, but we expect only two bright lines aligned
with the slits.
The condition for the constructive interference patterns (bright bands) at the photo￾graphic film in the case of lights were in phase when they were passing through the slits is
d sin θ = mλ , m = ±1, ±2, . . . . (1.68a)

These dark and bright regions are called interference fringes. The spacing between successive
dark and bright fringes is ∆ = λL/d. In optics, the wave amplitude is generally a complex
number, φ. The quantity, φ
∗φ = |φ|

is the intensity I of the light. Now, if φ1 and φ2 are
the amplitudes of the waves through slits 1 and 2, respectively, then

of the waves passing through the two slits.
In the second experiment, assume that the source releases the photons slowly so that
photons hit the screen without interaction. We do not expect interference pattern. Surpris￾ingly, we get the interference pattern as in Fig. 1.6. This means that a single particle is
also interfering with itself. What will happen if we replace the photographic film by particle
detectors?
Suppose we modify the set-up to determine through which slit each particle goes through.
We place one particle detector just behind slit-1 and another particle detector just behind
slit-2 [24]. The screen is also present. The detectors are such that they do not absorb
entire energy of the particles but only a fraction of energy and let the particles go toward
the screen. A few billion particles (photons or microscopic particles) are allowed to pass
through the slits. We close slit-2 first and let the microscopic particles pass through slit-1.
We get the pattern similar to the one shown in Fig. 1.6a. We repeat the experiment by
opening slit-2 and closing the other. We record the result and is as in Fig. 1.6b. Finally,
we open both slits. The resulting pattern is as in Fig. 1.6d. The interference pattern is not
realized. The result is that the detecting act forced each particle goes through one of the
slits and not through both the slits simultaneously. The above experiment was performed
with photons and atoms [25,26].
In the first experiment, interference occurred because the same light wave went through
the two slits. Interference took place in the second experiment also, where the photons
(particles) were sent one by one so that they did not interact. Here the photons behaved as
a wave. These same individuals behaved as particles when a detector was used to sense the
slit through which each of them passed through. The above experiments clearly demonstrate
the dual nature of microscopic particles.
An interesting observation is that we have interference in the absence of observers and
no interference pattern when observers are present. In other words, when we carry out aConcluding Remarks 23
measurement, it disturbs the trajectories of photons and the results of the experiment satisfy
with the classical physics – two bright lines on the film. But when we cease the measurement,
the pattern become multiple lines with brightness and darkness. More precisely, particle
cannot behave as a particle and a wave simultaneously. If an experiment is performed for
particle character, then particle property is observed. Similarly, if an experiment looks to
observe wave nature, then wave property is realized.
To explain the wave-particle duality Bohr assumed that we are able to measure a wave
property of light or particle property of light but not both simultaneously. This is called
complementarity principle of light. In 1992 Indian physicists Partha Ghose, Dipankar Home
and Girish S. Agarwal [27] proposed an experimental set-up to observe both wave and
particle properties of photon simultaneously. The experiment was then performed by the
Japanese scientists Y. Mizobuchi and Y. Ohtake [28] using a pulsed laser. The experiment
caught the wave and particle behaviours of photons simultaneously.
1.13 Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we considered some of the experimental observations which were not ade￾quately explained by classical theory and outlined how they have been properly interpreted
by the quantum theory. In the quantum theory, certain dynamical variables take on only
discrete or quantized values whereas in classical theory they take on a continuum of values.
The discreteness property gave rise to the name quantum mechanics or quantum theory.
After Planck’s idea of discrete energy values, initially, in the development of a new
theory (quantum theory), it was thought that classical mechanics was correct but with the
assumption that certain observables like energy and angular momentum take only discret
values. This is often referred to as old quantum theory. For example, in 1905 in his work on
the photoelectric effect Einstein postulated that the energy of a beam of light is quantized. In
1913 Bohr applied the idea of energy quantization to atoms and explained the various colours
emitted by hydrogen glowing in a discharge tube. In 1911 Arnold Sommerfeld analyzed the
influence of energy quantization on photon and momentum. We wish to stress that in all
the above work the concept of wave equation and wave function did not appear!
Very soon after de Broglie’s proposal of matter waves, Erwin Schr¨odinger, Werner Karl
Heisenberg and Paul Adrian Maurice Dirac developed quantum theory with three different
approaches. The approach of Heisenberg involved matrix calculus. Dirac introduced operator
theory. In 1926 Schr¨odinger starting with the idea of matter waves, set up a wave equation
known as Schr¨odinger wave equation and then the theory has seen tremendous fundamental
developments. In this book we present various developments and essential features of the
quantum theory.
Quantum theory is an amazingly successful theory giving predictions in very good agree￾ment with experimental observations in minute detail. The range of phenomena to which
the quantum theory has been applied is enormous. It covers phenomena from elementary
particle level to the early universe. Many modern technologies would be impossible without
quantum physics. Lasers, semiconductors and superconductors are just few among the vari￾ous applications of the most radical predictions of quantum mechanics. Many ordinary scale
physical phenomena are also explained by quantum theory. These include the existence of
solid bodies, physical properties of materials, phenomena of freezing and boiling, etc.24 Why Was Quantum Mechanics Developed?

Schro¨dinger Equation and Wave Function
2.1 Introduction
Till 1925 the idea of what the quantum theory would be was unknown. During 1925 three
different but equivalent versions of quantum theory were proposed – Schr¨odinger proposed
wave mechanics; Heisenberg developed matrix mechanics and Dirac-introduced operator
theory. Considering the de Broglie’s matter waves Erwin Schr¨odinger, an Austrian physi￾cist, argued that if a particle like an electron behaves as a wave then the equation of wave
motion could be successfully applied to it. He postulated a function varying in both space
and time in a wave-like manner (hence called wave function and denoted it as ψ). This func￾tion is generally complex and assumed to contain information about a system. Schr¨odinger
set up a linear and time-dependent wave-like equation, called Schro¨dinger wave equation,
to describe the wave aspect of a particle taking account of de Broglie’s relation for wave￾length. Physically, |ψ(X, t)|
2
, where ψ(X, t) is the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation, is
interpreted as position probability density. That is, |ψ(X, t)|
2
is the probability density of
observing a particle at position X at time t. ψ does not give exact outcomes of observations
but helps us to know all possible events and their probabilities. Further, the probability
interpretation allows us to find the average or expected result of a set of measurements on
a quantum system.
There are several interesting features of the wave function ψ. The probability inter￾pretation of |ψ|
2
imposes certain conditions on meaningful ψ. Further, the |ψ|
2
satisfies
a conservation law, an equation analogous to the continuity equation of flow in hydrody￾namics. To set the total probability unity the ψ must satisfy the normalization condition
R ∞
−∞ |ψ|
2dτ = 1. Knowing ψ we can compute expectation values of variables such as posi￾tion, momentum, etc. In quantum mechanics the experimentally measurable variables are
no longer dynamical variables but they become operators. The outcomes of experiments
are the eigenvalues of the operators of the observables. An interesting result is that the
equations of the time evolution of expectation values of position and momentum operators
(called Ehrenfest’s theorem) obey the same equation of motion of these variables in classi￾cal mechanics. On the other hand, the equation for the phase of the ψ function takes the
form of Hamilton–Jacobi equation of classical mechanics. In this chapter, we set up the
Schr¨odinger equation and discuss the above mentioned general properties of the solution of
the Schr¨odinger equation.
2.2 Construction of Schrodinger Equation ¨
In this section, we construct the wave equation for a particle moving in a potential V (X, t).
We start with a free particle then generalize the result for a particle in a potential V (X, t).

2.2.1 Schrodinger Equation for a Free Particle ¨
Suppose a particle is free and moving along a one-dimensional line. Assume that it behaves
like a wave and its wave function is of the form
ψ(x, t) = ae
i(kx−ωt)
. (2.1)
It is the simplest plane monochromatic wave. ψ refers to the case of wave propagating along
x-direction whereas the disturbance is in a plane perpendicular to the x-direction. ψ given
by Eq. (2.1) is called a plane wave since its amplitude |ψ| =
√
ψ∗ψ =
√
a
∗a = |a| is a
constant. Schr¨odinger combined the particle and wave properties in constructing the wave
equation. The angular frequency ω of the above wave should correspond to the energy E
of the particle while the wave number k should correspond to the momentum px = mv.
According to Planck and Einstein the relation between E of a particle and ω = 2πν of the
wave is
E = ~ω . (2.2)

Equation (2.12) describes the evolution of ψ(X, t) in the presence of a potential function
V (X). Whenever we make a measurement on a quantum system, the results are dictated by
ψ. The Schr¨odinger equation is used and accepted because it leads to results in agreement
with observation wherever it is applied properly.

This operator is called the Hamiltonian operator . In classical mechanics, Hamiltonian is a
basic dynamical variable from which we obtain Hamilton’s equation of motion describing
the evolution of state of a system. In quantum mechanics the Hamiltonian operator of the
system essentially determines the time variation of ψ. Note that to set up the wave equation
for a quantum mechanical system we require classical Hamiltonian. Then we obtain the wave
equation by replacing the classical dynamical variables X, p, V (X) and E by X, −i~∇,
V (X) and i~∂/∂t, respectively, and operating both sides of the equation E = H(X, p, t)
on ψ.
Replacing dynamical variables by operators is called first quantization. Replacing ψ by
an operator is termed as second quantization and is the case in quantum field theory.

2.4 Physical Interpretation of ψ
∗ψ
In connection with the wave function ψ we ask:
1. Is ψ an experimentally measurable quantity?
2. How is ψ related to the physical properties of the quantum mechanical system?
3. How do we determine the properties of the system from ψ?
Schr¨odinger thought that ψ described a particle; that is, ψ was in some sense regarded
as matter waves like sound waves and water waves. But this interpretation had several
difficulties. First, when we try to locate the particles using, say, detectors we find them
concentrated in a small region – it is localized. But the wave function ψ(X, t) at a given
time spreads out like a wave – it is nonlocalized. Second, suppose we interpret ψ as a wave
in physical space and time of one particle. In the case of n particles, the wave has to be
represented in a 3n-dimensional space. The third point is that ψ is generally complex. We
can give interpretation to real waves only. How do we account for complex values of ψ?
Therefore, a new interpretation is essential.
ψ is in some sense related to the presence of a particle. Therefore, we do not expect a
particle in the regions of space where ψ = 0. On the other hand, ψ must be nonzero in the
region where there is a particle.Physical Interpretation of ψ
∗ψ 31
In the year 1926, Max Born (Noble Prize in 1954) considered the collision of two particles.
Far before and far after the collision the two particles behave as free particles. Using a
perturbation theory he obtained
ψscat(r → ∞) ≈
X
f
cf iφf , cf i =
Z
φ
∗
fV φi dτ . (2.20)
Here φf is the solution of the stationary state Schr¨odinger equation and represents the state
of the particle far after scattering (called final state) with momentum Kf . φi
is the initial
state solution (state far before collision) with the momentum Ki and V is the potential.
In Eq. (2.20) suppose |cf i|
2
is related to the number of particles scattered with final state
φf and initial state φi
. That is, |c1i
|
2
, |c2i
|
2
, . . . represent, far after scattering, the number
of particles (or percentage of incident particles) in the states φ1, φ2, . . ., respectively, with
all their state far before interaction is φi
. In this case ψ would be describing the particles
themselves. Assume a barrier potential having the property that it would reflect 60% of the
incident particles and scatter 40% of them. There is no difficulty with the above meaning
of cf i and ψ. Suppose only one particle incident on the barrier. Then according to the
above 60% of it is to be scattered and 40% is to be reflected. Born realized that since a
single particle cannot divide itself, ψ could not describe the particle itself. Therefore, only
one interpretation is possible for the coefficient cf i – it is the probability amplitude that
the incident particle with momentum Ki to be scattered with momentum Kf . We have no
answer to the question What is the state after the collision? but we have the answer to the
question What is the probability of a given effect of the collision?
Considering the above Max Born and Ernst Pascual Jordan interpreted ψ
∗ψ as position
probability density. They interpreted |ψ|
2 as
P dxdydz = ψ
∗ψdxdydz = |ψ|
2
dxdydz , (2.21)
where Pdxdydz is the probability that the system will be in the volume element dxdydz
at the position X. The basis for Eq. (2.21) is that in the classical theory of light, the
intensity of light at each point is given by the square of the amplitude of a wave.
This indicates that, in quantum mechanics a wave function can be introduced play￾ing the role of a probability. Note that, ψ itself cannot be a probability. This is be￾cause ψ may be complex and negative but probability is always real and positive. ψ
has no direct physical significance and is not experimentally measurable. It is not a
physical entity existing in space such as a cricket ball or electric field. Its purpose is
to calculate |ψ|
2
. That is, it is a mathematical tool for computing the outcomes of
observations.
According to probability interpretation of ψ
∗ψ, we can never say that quantum particle
exists or not at a certain place2
. Born, Bohr and his group in Copenhagen analyzed the
probability interpretation of ψ
∗ψ in great depth. For this reason probabilistic interpretation
of ψ
∗ψ is also referred as the Copenhagen interpretation. Other interpretations have also
been proposed. For example, sum-over histories [3,4] by Richard Feynman and many worlds
interpretation [5,6] by Huge Everett and John Cramer’s transactional interpretation [7,8]
have also received considerable interest. The point is that a given initial conditions can give
a range of final outcomes, so quantum theory makes the future open and hinder our ability
to know the past.
2
In connection with the above Robert Oppenheimer made a remark that [2] we must say ‘no’ for whether
the position of the electron remains the same or changes with time or the electron is at rest or it is in
motion.32 Schro¨dinger Equation and Wave Function
2.5 Conditions on Allowed Wave Functions
The probability interpretation of ψ
∗ψ leads to the following conditions on ψ.
1. Integration of ψ
∗ψ with respect to space variables over all space should be unity:
Z ∞
−∞
ψ
∗ψ dτ = 1 . (2.22)
2. |ψ| → 0 as |X| → ∞.
3. ψ must be single-valued at each and every point.
4. ψ must not have the value of infinite at any point.
5. ψ, ψx, ψy and ψz must be continuous functions of X.
The integral in Eq. (2.22) represents total probability. Since total probability must be one
for any event ψ must satisfy the condition Eq. (2.22). Such a wave function is said to be
normalized. The condition Eq. (2.22) is called normalization condition. If
Z ∞
−∞
ψ
∗ψ dτ = N
2
, N2 = constant 6= 1, 6= ∞ (2.23)
then ψ is said to be square-integrable and the constant N2
is called norm of ψ. Such a wave
function can always be normalized by multiplying it by the constant 1/N. This is possible
because the Schr¨odinger equation is linear and therefore if ψ is a solution of it then αψ,
where α is a constant, is also a solution. The finiteness requirement of the norm imposes
the condition (2). This means that ψ
∗ψ → 0 as |X| → ∞ and thus the particle is confined
to a finite region of space. Such a state is said to be a bound state. It is called a bound
state because the corresponding classical particle motion is bounded. If ψ(X, t) does not
tend to 0 as |X| → ∞ then it is nonnormalizable. Such a state is called a scattering state.
The motion of the corresponding classical particle is unbounded.
Note that an overall phase eiα in a wave function is unobservable. ψ and eiαψ both
describe the same physical state. But if a constant phase appears as a relative phase between
two ψ’s in a linear superposition as in ψ = ψ1 + eiαψ2 then it is observable; it gives
interference effects and a shift in α introduces a shift in interference fringes.
Is ψ(X, t) a dimensionless quantity? If not, what is the dimension of it? The prob￾ability of finding a particle in a given volume dτ = dxdydz at a point X at a time t
is |ψ(X, t)|
2dxdydz. Probability is a dimensionless quantity. Therefore, |ψ|
2dxdydz should
also be dimensionless. dx, dy and dz have the dimension of length. Therefore, the dimension
of ψ(X, t) is (length)−3/2
. This is for a single particle in three-dimensional space. For N￾particles in a d-dimensional space the dimension of the wave function is (length)−Nd/2
. As
the dimensions of x and px are L and MLT−1
, respectively, the dimension of ~ is dimension
of x× dimension of px and is ML2T

Solved Problem 1:
If ψ = sechax, calculate the probability of finding the particle right of the point x = 0.

find the region of
space, where the particle is most likely to be found.
The probability density is given by |ψ|
2 = (1/(a
√
π ))e−x
2/a2
. This is a simple function.
We use the graph of |ψ|
2 versus x to find the maximum value of |ψ|
2
. It is maximum at
x = 0 and decreases exponentially for |x| > 0. Thus, the particle is most likely to be found
in a region of width a on either side of x = 0. For the complicated form of |ψ|
2 = f(x) the
conditions df /dx = 0 and d2
f /dx
2 < 0 are to be used to determine a maximum of f(x).
2.6 Box Normalization
Normalization of a given wave function is possible only if the norm, the value of R ∞
−∞ ψ
∗ψ dτ,
is finite. But for many physically interesting wave functions the value of this integral be￾comes infinite. For example, for the wave function given by Eq. (2.1) the value of the integral
is infinite. Hence, it is nonnormalizable. However, such wave functions are widespread in
quantum mechanics, specifically in scattering problems, and they have considerable math￾ematical advantages.
An approach of handling a nonnormalizable ψ is the following. Assume that the particle
is confined within a large box and that the ψ
∗ψ is taken over the interior of the box only.
Discard the infinite region of space outside the box. Now, the norm is finite; it can be made
unity by multiplying a suitable constant. For any calculation use this normalized wave
function. After completion of calculation, impose the limit of infinite volume for the box.
This procedure is called box normalization. In this way the nonnormalizable ψ is visualized
as a limit of realizable and normalizable wave function.
Let us perform the above scheme to the wave function, Eq. (2.1). Suppose the box is a
cube with edges of length L parallel to the x, y, z axes and its centre is the origin. Then
the normalization gives
1 = ZZ Z L/2
−L/2
ψ
∗ψ dxdydz = |a|
2
ZZZ L/2
−L/2
dxdydz = L
3
|a|
2
. (2.26)
Hence, a = L
−3/2 and the normalized wave function is
ψ = L
−3/2
e
−i(k·X−ωt)
. (2.27)
Note that the condition ψ(X, t) → 0 as |X| → ∞ is not applicable to the above ψ. Impose
that ψ is periodic with respect to L of the box. Then eikxL = eikyL = eikzL = 1 and
hence kx, ky and kz must be integer multiples of 2π/L: k =
2π
L
n, nx, ny, nz = 0, ±1, . . . .
Thus, the momentum vectors are discrete or quantized for the particle in a box. The box
normalization discretizes k.34 Schro¨dinger Equation and Wave Function
When the values of k are continuous the so-called Dirac-delta normalization is useful.

2.7 A Special Feature of Occurrence of i in the Schrodinger ¨
Equation
Note that the imaginary number i appears in the fundamental equation, Schr¨odinger equa￾tion. What is a special feature of explicit occurrence of i in the Schro¨dinger equation? Let
us point out this [9,10].
Consider the familiar classical wave equation
utt = c
2uxx. (2.31)
Suppose u is complex-valued and define it as u(x, t) = A(x, t) + iB(x, t). Substitution of
this solution in Eq. (2.31) leads to
Att = c
2Axx, Btt = c
2Bxx. (2.32)
That is,, A and B are independent of each other and hence one can choose them freely,
however, they are solutions of Eqs. (2.32). Usually, oscillating travelling waves are chosen
as u(x, t) = ae
i(kx−ωt) and physical meaning is attached to the real part of u.
Next, ψ(x, t) = A(x, t) + iB(x, t) in the Schr¨odinger equation i~∂ψ/∂t =
−(~
2/(2m))∂
2ψ/∂x2 gives
i~(At + iBt) = −
~
2
2m
(Axx + iBxx). (2.33)
The real and imaginary parts of this equation give
Bt =
~
2m
Axx, At = −
~
2m
Bxx. (2.34)
A and B are not independent to each other but they are dependent to one another. Both A
and B are needed to describe the physical situation. Further, note that the probability den￾sity is now P = ψ
∗ψ = A2+B2
. What do you get if you start with ψ(x, t) = ψ(x) cos(Et/~)?
Why do we have i in Eq. (2.7)? Note that i occurs in Eq. (2.4) which is obtained by
differentiating Eq. (2.1) with respect to t. That is, i appeared explicitly due to the fact that
the time periodic wave function ψ given by Eq. (2.1) is represented by complex exponential.Conservation of Probability 35
2.8 Conservation of Probability
The probability interpretation of ψ
∗ψ can be made consistently, provided the conservation of
probability is guaranteed. If the probability of finding a particle in a region of space decreases
as time increases then the probability of finding it outside this region must increase by the
same amount so that total probability is always unity. Therefore, we expect ρ = ψ
∗ψ to
satisfy the conservation equation (also called continuity equation)
∂ρ
∂t + ∇ · J = 0 . (2.35)
The continuity equation is necessary to prove that particles do not disappear locally. In
hydrodynamics ρ in Eq. (2.35) is the fluid density and J represents the fluid current density.
In electrodynamics ρ and J are the charge density and current density, respectively. Let us
derive a probability conservation law for ψ from the Schr¨odinger equation.
Define ρ = ψ
∗ψ as the position probability density. The probability P of the particle in
a volume V is R

Therefore,

∂t + ∇ · J = 0 . (2.43)
The interpretation of ψ
∗ψ as a probability density leads to the satisfaction of continuity
equation.
J is defined as a probability current density or probability flux vector . J at X is the
amount of probability crossing at that point in unit time. It corresponds to the Poynting
vector in classical electromagnetic theory. The increase (decrease) of the probability inside
a finite volume V is due to the influx (outward flux) of the probability current through the
surface A bounding this volume. What is the significance of ∇ · J = 0?
Solved Problem 3:

We obtain ∂ρ/∂t = 0 and ∂J/∂x = 0 and hence ∂ρ/∂t + ∂J/∂x = 0.
2.9 Expectation Value
Suppose we measure the position of a quantum mechanical particle a large number of times.
Even if the wave function of the particle is same before every observation we do not get
same result. In this case we are interested to know the average or expected value of the
set of measurements of position denoted as hxi. Knowing ψ, how do we compute hxi? To
obtain the expression for hxi, instead of a quantum system, consider a classical system, for
example a die with six sides numbered as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 or say a1, a2, . . ., a6, respectively.
Throw the die N (very large) number of times and record the outcome in each throw. Let
Ni denote the number of times the event ai occurred. Then the average or expectation value
of throw of the die is
houtcomei =
1
N
(N1a1 + . . . + N6a6) = X
i
aiP (ai) = X
a
aP(a), (2.46)
where summation is over all possible values of a. Here the possible values of a are assumed
as discrete. When the outcome of an experiment takes any value in an interval, say, [−∞, ∞]
then
houtcomei =
Z ∞
−∞
aP(a) da . (2.47)
In quantum theory P(X, t)dτ = ψ
∗ψdτ, where dτ = dxdydz, gives the probability of finding
a particle in a volume dτ centred at X and hence for position measurements Eq. (2.47Expectation Value 37

value of Xn is given by in terms of ψ or φ

(X, t)Xnψ(X, t) dτ . (2.49)

The expectation values are functions of time only, since the space coordinates have
to be integrated out. The expectation value may be real or complex depending on
the nature of A. However, in an experiment we can measure only real value. Thus,
only the dynamical variables whose expectation values are real to be considered di￾rectly measurable or observable. Therefore, if A is an observable then hAi = hAi

Equation (2.56) is defined for a noninteracting particle. For the more general case, such
as a particle interacting with a heat bath or the environment, the expected value is given
by [11] hA(t)i = Tr[ρ(t)A], where ρ is the density matrix and is the solution of the von

Equations (2.74) are analogous to the classical equations of motion, Eq. (2.70). Thus, the
quantum mechanical hXi and hpi obey the classical equation of motion. This is known as
Ehrenfest’s theorem. The theorem states that the Schro¨dinger equation leads to the satis￾faction of Newton’s second-law of motion on the average. The Eqs. (2.74) are crucial for
understanding the emergence of classical mechanics from quantum mechanics.
2.10.2 Verification of Ehrenfest’s Theorem
In this section, we verify the Ehrenfest’s theorem in certain interesting systems. First, we
solve the Eqs. (2.74) for linear harmonic oscillator and show that their solutions are identical
to the solutions of classical equation of motion. Next, we consider a particle in an infinite
square-well potential. We give the solutions of classical and quantum cases. We discuss the
classical limit of quantum solutions.

which is same as the Eq. (2.76).
2.10.2.2 Particle in an Infinite Square-Well Potential
Let us consider a particle of mass m confined to one-dimensional infinite height potential
with V (x) = 0 for 0 < x < a and ∞ otherwise.
Classical Case
The particle moves between the walls x = 0 and a with a uniform velocity v. Its velocity
gets reversed when it hits the walls. This to-and-fro motion is given by [12]

(2.79)

of the wall to the other. A Fourier series of this solution is

quantum hxi goes over to the corresponding classical trajectory.
Some other examples on the significance of Ehrenfest’s theorem are given in refs.[13–15].
Ehrenfest’s theorem is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a quantum system
to display classical behaviour. The harmonic oscillator satisfies Eqs. (2.74). But a quantum
oscillator has discrete energy eigenvalues contradictory to the classical system. The system
obeys Ehrenfest’s theorem but does not behave classically. This system is an example of lack
of sufficiency. For an example of lack of necessity – that a system may behave classically
even when Ehrenfest’s theorem does not apply – see ref. [14].Basic Postulates 43
2.11 Basic Postulates
In classical mechanics we work with the position, the momentum, the total energy, etc. These
quantities are called dynamical variables. In quantum mechanics the dynamical variables
are no longer variables but operators. An operator is operated on the wave function to get
various outcomes of the corresponding physical variable. Based on our discussion so far, we
now list important postulates in quantum mechanics.
Postulate 1:
For every dynamical system there exists a wave function (and its spatial derivatives). It is
continuous, finite, single-valued function of the parameters of the system, space coordinate
and time. From the wave function, predictions of physical properties of the system to be
made. This postulate contains requirements that all physical waves such as sound waves,
electromagnetic waves and water waves meet.
Postulate 2:
The Hamiltonian operator of a quantum mechanical system determines the evolution of the
system. The classical E = H = p
2/(2m) + V (X) is converted into the wave Eq. (2.12)
by the substitution of operators for dynamical variables: x → xˆ, X → Xˆ , px → −i~∂/∂x,
p → −i~∇ and E → i~∂/∂t.
Postulate 3:
ψ
∗ψ is interpreted as position probability density and an admissible ψ must satisfy the
normalization condition (2.22) to make total probability unity.
Postulate 4:
For every observable physical quantity, there exists a corresponding operator with real
eigenvalues. The only measurable values of an observable are the possible eigenvalues of the
corresponding operator.
Postulate 5:
Quantum mechanics does not say with certainty the outcome of an experiment. But it
allows computing of probabilities for the various possible outcomes. Consequently, we are
interested in the average value of a dynamical variable A and this is given by Eq. (2.56).
2.12 Time Evolution of Stationary States
Consider the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation. As stated earlier the state of a quan￾tum mechanical system is represented by a wave function ψ. |ψ|
2
is assumed to give the posi￾tion probability density. From the solution φ(X) of time-independent Schr¨odinger Eq. (2.17),
the solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation is written as
ψn(X, t) = φn(X)e−iEnt/~
. (2.87)
We note that |ψn(X, t)|
2
is independent of time. Further, the time dependence of ψn(X, t)
is periodic with angular frequency ω = En/~. Such states are called stationary states. In
quantum mechanics a stationary state does not mean that the system is strictly in a rest
state or in a classical equilibrium point. In this state, expectation values of all dynamical44 Schro¨dinger Equation and Wave Function

n
(X)Aφn(X)dτ (2.88)
are independent of time. It means that though ψ may vary with time, ψ
∗ψ at any point in
the configuration space is independent of time.
The solution φn(X) of the time-independent Schr¨odinger Eq. (2.17) for a fixed value of
En is obviously time-independent and thus φ
∗
nφn is independent of time. Therefore, we call
Eq. (2.17) the stationary state Schro¨dinger equation and its solutions as stationary state
solutions or eigenfunctions. This is an energy eigenvalue equation, Hφ = Eφ. Consequently,
when the state of the particle is the solution of Eq. (2.17) then the energy of it has a definite
value given by the eigenvalue E.
Suppose a particle is initially in a stationary state represented by a ψn(X, 0) = φn(X).
Then from Eq. (2.87) we write
ψn(X, t) = ψn(X, 0)e−iEnt/~
(2.89)
and |ψn(X, t)|
2 = |ψn(X, 0)|
2
is independent of time. That is, if a system is initially in a
stationary state then it remains in that state forever . Though ψn(X, t) changes with time
the energy and expectation values of observables remain the same.
We note that the wave function given by Eq. (2.89) is a particular solution of the time￾dependent Schr¨odinger equation. A combination of such particular solutions is given by the
Eq. (2.19). Now we ask: Can the wave function given by Eq. (2.19) represent a stationary
state? The answer is no, as shown below.
Let us calculate ψ
∗ψ of ψ given by Eq. (2.19). For simplicity assume that the energy
values are discrete. We write ψ
∗ as ψ

. (2.90)
Since the second term in the above equation contains t, ψ
∗ψ is dependent on time. Therefore,
solution ψ given by the Eq. (2.19) does not represent a stationary state solution.
From our above discussion we say that a stationary state solution of a quantum system
is obtained by finding the solution of the time-independent Schr¨odinger Eq. (2.17) and
then multiply it by e−iEt/~
, provided the potential is time-independent. Now, an interesting
question is: What are the allowed values of E? Can E be arbitrary? Does there exist a
(bounded)solution of Eq. (2.17) for all real values of E? The answer is no. Solutions exist
only for certain specific values of E. This is because the solution of Eq. (2.17) satisfies the
admissible conditions only for certain values of E. The allowed energy values are called the
eigenvalue spectrum or energy levels of the system. Can you recall some of the equations
that are in the form of Aφ = λφ where A is a linear differential operator for which bounded
solution exist only for certain discrete real values of λ? What are their eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions?
2.13 Conditions for Allowed Transitions
Suppose we wish to know whether a particle is able to make a transition from a given state
to another state. Also, we ask: Can a particle jump to an arbitrary state? If not, to which
states can it jump? What does happen when the particle goes from one energy state to
another? We will address these questions in this section.Orthogonality of Two States 45
Bohr postulated that when a particle makes transition from a higher energy level Em to
a lower energy level En then the frequency of the radiation emitted is νmn = (Em − En) /~.
Can a particle emit radiation when it is in a stationary state? The answer is no. To prove
this consider a quantum system of a particle moving only in the x-direction and is in a state
φn(x) with energy En. The time-dependent eigenfunction associated with this state is
ψn(x, t) = φn(x)e−iEnt/~
. (2.91)
Now, the expectation value of the position of the particle is
hxi =

xψ∗
n
(x, t)ψn(x, t)dx =
Z ∞
−∞
xφ∗
n
(x)φn(x)dx (2.92)
which is independent of time. Thus, the hxi of the particle does not oscillate and no radiation
occurs.
Next, we calculate hxi for the transition from Em to En. The ψ of the particle is aφm +
bφn, where a
∗a and b
∗
b are the probabilities for the particle to be in φm and φn, respectively.

where νmn = (Em − En)/~. If the particle is in a specific state Em or En then ν = 0 and
hxi = constant, independent of time. When the particle makes a transition from the state
Em to the state En then hxi oscillates with time and the frequency of radiation emitted is
νmn. From Eq. (2.93) we obtain the condition for hxi 6= constant as
Z ∞

φ

m x φndx 6= 0 . (2.94)
If the value of the above integral is nonzero then the transition from the level Em to En
is allowed otherwise the transition is forbidden. The conditions on m and n for which the
integral in Eq. (2.94) is nonzero are called selection rules. Since the electric dipole operator
is given as ex, the transition based on the above selection rule is called electric dipole
transition.
2.14 Orthogonality of Two States
A wave function belonging to a specific energy (eigen)value En is commonly called an
energy eigenfunction φn. An important property of eigenfunctions φn of stationary state
Schr¨odinger equation is that two eigenfunctions belonging to two different energy values
Em and En satisfy the integral equation

In vector analysis two vectors u and v for which u·v =
P
i
uivi = 0 are called orthogonal. (If
the number of the components of u and v are very large and the increment is infinitesimally
small then we replace the summation in the above by integral). In analogy with this φm
and φn satisfying the condition (2.95) are called orthogonal functions. Orthogonal functions
refer to states that are independent of one another. The different possible energy states of
a particle are all orthogonal to one another.
Let φm and φn are two eigenfunctions with energies Em and En, respectively. These
functions satisfy the equations (refer to Eq. (2.17))

2.15 Phase of the Wave Function
In 1926 Gregor Wentzel, Hendrik Anthony Kramers and Leon Nicolas Brillouin showed the
possibility of getting the classical Hamilton–Jacobi equation from the Schr¨odinger equation
in Planck’s limit h → 0. This is an another example for Planck’s correspondence principle.
In sec. 2.10 we have seen that in quantum mechanics the expectation values of X and p
operators obey the same equation of motion of the X and p variables in classical mechanics.
Now, we show that in quantum mechanics the equation for phase of the complex ψ takes
the form of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of classical physics [16].
Assume the solution of a time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation in the form
ψ(X, t) = A(X, t)eiS(X,t)/~
. (2.104)
Substituting Eq. (2.104) in the Schr¨odinger Eq. (2.12) and separating real and imaginary
parts we get

A∇2S + 2∇A · ∇S

= 0 . (2.105b)
Defining ρ = |ψ|
2 = A2 Eq. (2.105b) takes the form, with the substitution ∂A = ∂ρ/(2√
ρ)
and ∇A = ∇ρ/(2√
ρ),
∂ρ
∂t +
1
m
∇ · (ρ∇S) = 0 . (2.106)
This is the continuity equation for conservation of probability with the probability flux
J = ρ∇S/m. Equation (2.105a) is rewritten as

(∇S)
2 + V + Vq = 0 , Vq = −
~
2
2m
∇2A
A
. (2.107)
Since V and Vq appears in the equation in the same way, Vq is called quantum potential. Vq
is state dependent. Equation (2.107) is of the form of classical Hamilton–Jacobi equation. It
is called quantum Hamilton–Jacobi equation. The observation is that the phase of ψ obeys
the same equation as the Hamilton principle function in classical mechanics in the limit
Vq → 0.48 Schro¨dinger Equation and Wave Function
Introducing v(X, t) as J/ρ = ∇S/m and taking the gradient of Eq. (2.107) gives
m
∂v
∂t + m (v · ∇) v + ∇ (V + Vq) = 0 . (2.108)
The first two terms in the above equation is mdv/dt. The system thus moves with the
acceleration
m
dv
dt
= −∇ (V + Vq) . (2.109)
The force is given not only by the gradient of V but also by ∇Vq. If Vq → 0 as ~ → 0 then
the particle trajectories will obey Newton’s equation of motion.
2.16 Classical Limit of Quantum Mechanics
Classical mechanics has been verified in a wide variety of phenomena. It is thus natural to
know the limit with which quantum mechanics agrees with classical mechanics. We cannot
simply define ~ → 0 as the classical limit. Special relativity reduces to classical Galilean
relativity in the limit c → ∞ or v/c ≪ 1, where v is the speed of a particle. In this
limit relativistic mechanics includes Newtonian mechanics as a special case. But quantum
mechanics is formulated in terms of probabilities. It does not predict the individual observed
possibility but predicts only the probabilities of the possibilities.
If quantum mechanics has to give an individual trajectory in the classical limit, it is
necessary for the probability distribution to become arbitrarily narrow as ~ → 0. Certain
special case of states behave like this. But many realistic states do not. Therefore, we cannot
expect to get an individual classical trajectory when we let the classical limit of quantum
mechanics. Instead we may expect the probability distribution of quantum mechanics to
become equivalent to the probability distribution of an ensemble of classical trajectories.
Consider an ensemble of identical particles with an initial position x0 as F(x0) and
with the identical initial momenta px0 [17]. In classical mechanics, the position probability
density function of an ensemble is given by [18]
P(x, t) = ∂

where S is the Hamilton principle function. An approximate solution of the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation, up to terms linear in ~ obtained using WKB approximation method
is [18]



. (2.111)
The |ψ(x, t)|
2 obtained from Eq. (2.111) agrees with P(x, t) given by Eq. (2.110). Thus, if
one restricts to the effects of the first-order in ~ then in the classical limit the time evolution
of the quantum mechanical ensemble is similar to that of the classical ensemble.
To get deeper insight of the classical limit of quantum mechanics let us introduce the
following statement and call it as the classical limit postulate.
In the classical limit the time development of a quantum mechanical ensemble is identical
with that of an ensemble of a classical system whose initial distribution of position and
momentum are same as that of the quantum mechanical ensemble at the initial instant.Concluding Remarks 49
To test the above postulate, we take a classical limit in the construction of ψ(x, t) by
suitably combining the eigenfunctions belonging to the continuum limit so that the time￾dependent wave equation is exactly solvable. The evolution of the classical ensemble can
be computed using the equations of motion applied to the phase space density function.
According to the above postulate the evolution of two such ensembles should be the same if
the initial position and momentum probability distribution functions are the same. In the
following we verify this connection for a free particle. For the case of harmonic oscillator
and a particle in a homogeneous potential field the reader may refer to ref. [17].
Let us choose ψ(x, 0) of an ensemble of free particles as the Gaussian function centred
at the origin

Next, consider the time evolution of a classical ensemble of a free particle with P given by
Eq. (2.113). The classical phase space density function is D(x, k, 0) = |ψ(x, 0)|

|φ(k, 0)|

Then P(x, t) = ~

D(x, k, t)dk. It is easy to verify that the resulting expression for P(x, t)
is same as that given by Eq. (2.114). When the classical probability density for a particle
of particular energy coincides with PQM = ψ
∗ψ it is called configuration correspondence.
2.17 Concluding Remarks
Note that the time evolution of ψ is described by the Schr¨odinger equation which is de￾terministic, but the observable quantities associated with this ψ are stated in terms of
probability only. The probability concept is also used in classical mechanics in some occa￾sions. For most of the traditional experiments of quantum physics, it is not possible to set
up an individual quantum object, for example, an atom and probe it. Instead, we can probe
an ensemble of identically prepared objects then the ensemble average is treated as the
quantum average. In an electron-atom collision experiment, thousands of different electrons50 Schro¨dinger Equation and Wave Function
knock electrons out of different atoms and for each individual case, the momenta of tar￾get electrons before the collision are determined by momentum conservation. The result is
interpreted as the probability distribution of finding a given momentum in a single atom.
Thus, even if the fundamental mechanics of atoms and molecules were classical, we still
need to describe most experiments with atoms using probabilities.
The spectacular advances in science in 20th century could not have occurred without
the use of quantum theory and the Schr¨odinger equation. Though the quantum theory
gives the probability interpretation of the wave function, there is no other theory which
gives a comparable quantitative description of the atom, molecule, nucleus, fields and even
macroscopic matters like solids, liquids, conductors and semiconductors. Without quantum
theory, phenomena like superconductivity, superfluidity, Bose–Einstein condensation cannot
be explained. Every advanced technology makes use of the tools provided by quantum
mechanics.

Operators, Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions
3.1 Introduction
A basic quantity in quantum mechanics is the wave function ψ. Given a quantum mechanical
system we write the Schr¨odinger equation for it. Its solution is the wave function. When
introducing the wave function we stated that the maximum information about the state of a
system can be obtained only from ψ. How do we extract observable properties of the system
from the wave function? In quantum mechanics for every classical dynamical variable there
exists an operator. For example, the operator of momentum p is −i~∇ while the operator of
energy variable H = p
2/(2m) +V (X) is −(~
2/2m)∇2 +V (X). Operation of an operator on
ψ gives another function. If the new function is λψ, then λ is the eigenvalue of the operator.
For example, the energy of a particle in a particular state represented by ψ can be obtained
by operating H on ψ. That is, we have Hψ = Eψ, where E is the energy eigenvalue. The
expectation value of A(X, p) can be obtained from the formula
hAi =
Z ∞
−∞
ψ
∗Aψ dτ , (3.1)
where ψ is the solution of the equation Hψ = Eψ.
Operators in quantum mechanics which represent observables are of a special type: They
are linear and Hermitian. Such operators not only form computation tools, but also form
the most effective language in terms of which the theory can be formulated. The fascinating
point is that using linear operators we can understand the quantum mechanics. Therefore,
it is important to study the basic theory of linear operators. In this chapter, we present
important properties of linear operators and their eigenfunctions. We discuss the features
of various operators which are necessary for studying quantum mechanical systems. This
chapter will show how rich and beautiful the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics
is.
3.2 Linear Operators
An operator Aop is a mathematical operation which, when it acts on a function f(x) gives
another function g(x):
Aopf(x) = g(x). (3.2)
For simplicity we drop the subscript ‘op’ in Aop. Mathematical operations such as addition,
subtraction, differentiation, integration, etc. can be represented by appropriate operators.
An example of operator is d/dx.
Usually an operator is specified by its action. However, an operator essentially consists
of its action and its domain. By action we mean what the operator does to the functions. On
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172178-3 5556 Operators, Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions
the other hand, the specified set of functions on which the operator acts are referred as the
domain of the operator. Why should one define the domain of an operator? We will come
to this question when discussing about self-adjoint and Hermitian operators in sec. 3.4.
3.2.1 Definition
An operator A is said to be a linear operator if it satisfies the rules
A (φ1 + φ2) = Aφ1 + Aφ2 , (3.3a)
A (cφ1) = cAφ1 , A (cφ2) = cAφ2 , (3.3b)
where φ1 and φ2 are given functions and c is any arbitrary complex constant. The operator
d/dx is linear because

(φ1 + φ2) = d

φ2 . (3.4b)
Operators do not generally have the property given by Eq. (3.3a). Suppose an operator A
is defined by Aφ = sin φ. Then left-side of Eq. (3.3a) is
A (φ1 + φ2) = sin (φ1 + φ2) . (3.5a)
The right-side of Eq. (3.3a) is
Aφ1 + Aφ2 = sin φ1 + sin φ2 . (3.5b)
Right-sides of Eqs. (3.5) are not same. That is, the operator A defined by Aφ = sin φ is not
a linear operator.
3.2.2 Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions of Linear Operators
Suppose we assume that
Aφ = λφ , (3.6)
where λ is a number. Equation (3.6) is called the eigenvalue equation of A. φ is called
an eigenfunction of A. λ is called the eigenvalue of the operator A corresponding to the
eigenfunction φ. Given an eigenvalue equation we ask: What are the values of λ for which
nontrivial solutions which are finite everywhere even at x = ±∞ occur? In general, nontrivial
solutions exist for certain values of λ only. The certain values are called eigenvalues1
. The
eigenvalues are the important values of λ because only for these specific set of values Eq. (3.6)
has nontrivial solutions. These solutions, called eigenfunctions, are the important solutions
because they are the only possible meaningful solutions. The set of eigenvalues is called a
spectrum.
Suppose A and B are two linear operators. The linear combination of them is C =
αA + βB. Is C a linear operator? The answer is yes (see the exercise 5 at the end of this
chapter). That is, a linear combination of the two or more linear operators is also a linear
operator. It is easy to show that product of two or more linear operators is also a linear
operator. If Aφ = 0 then A is called a singular operator . When AB = BA = I then A−1 = B
and B−1 = A. Now, the operators A and B are called nonsingular operators.
1Eigen is a German word which means certain.Linear Operators 57
Some of the properties of linear operators are summarized below:
A + B = B + A, (3.7a)
A + B + C = (A + B) + C = A + (B + C), (3.7b)
A(BC) = (AB)C + ABC, (3.7c)
(A + B)C = AC + BC, (3.7d)
A(B + C) = AB + AC, (3.7e)
A
2 = AA . (3.7f)
In quantum mechanics, the operators associated with the observables such as position,
linear momentum, angular momentum and energy all satisfy the properties of linear oper￾ators.
Example 1:
Let us see how eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of an operator can be calculated. For illus￾trative purpose we consider the operator x + d/dx. The eigenvalue equation for the given
operator is

x +
d
dx

φ = λφ . (3.8)
Rewriting it as
dφ
φ
= (λ − x) dx (3.9)
and integrating on both sides we obtain
φ(x) = c e
λx−x
2/2
, (3.10)
where c is a constant. The eigenfunction φ is continuous and well defined for any value of
λ. Thus, the eigenvalues of the given operator form a continuous spectrum. However, in
quantum mechanics a physically acceptable wave function should satisfy certain boundary
conditions. When these boundary conditions are applied, then the eigenvalues may not
take continuous values. Only for certain values of λ, the wave function may be physically
acceptable. Under such situations, λ values will take discrete values. In the case of the
Schr¨odinger equation Hψ = Eψ, the boundary conditions on ψ lead to discrete energy
eigenvalues and quantum numbers.
A linear operator that when acted on all the normalizable eigenfunctions of a system
gives normalizable eigenfunctions is termed as a bounded opertor . The operator which leads
to nonnormalizable eigenfunctions is an unbounded operator . The momentum operator −i~∇
and the operator multiplication by x are unbounded operators.
Example 2:
There are a number of operators for which the eigenvalues are discrete. For example, consider
the operator
L =
￾
1 − x
2
 d
2
dx
2
− 2x
d
dx
. (3.11)
It is a linear operator. Its eigenvalue equation is Ly = λy. With −λ = l(l + 1) we can
identify the equation Ly = λy as the Legendre differential equation. It has bounded solutions
only for integer values of l and the associated solutions (called Legendre polynomials) are
defined for x ∈ [−1, 1] [1,2]. The eigenvalues of L are certain integers and the correspondin58 Operators, Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions
eigenfunctions are Legendre polynomials. If λ is not chosen as −l(l+ 1) with l taking integer
values, then we will get a diverging infinite series solution, which is not an acceptable
physical wave function. So, the condition λ = −l(l + 1) with l taking 0, 1, 2, . . . gives a
finite polynomial solutions which are physically acceptable.
An important property of eigenfunctions of linear operators is that a linear combination
of two eigenfunctions belonging to two distinct eigenvalues of a linear operator A is not
an eigenfunction of it. To prove this assume that φa and φb are two eigenfunctions of an
operator A with distinct eigenvalues a and b, respectively. The eigenvalue equations for φa
and φb are
Aφa = aφa , Aφb = bφb . (3.12)
Suppose the linear combination ψ = αφa + βφb is an eigenfunction of A. Then we must
have Aψ = λψ, that is
A (αφa + βφb) = λ (αφa + βφb) , (3.13)
where λ is the eigenvalue of A corresponding to ψ. Using Eq. (3.12) in Eq. (3.13) we obtain
α(a − λ)φa + β(b − λ)φb = 0 . (3.14)
This equation is true only if λ = a and λ = b. Since a and b are distinct eigenvalues the
Eq. (3.14) is not true. Therefore, ψ = αφa +βφb cannot be an eigenfunction of A. Equation
(3.14) implies that if φ1 and φ2 are two linearly independent eigenfunctions of a linear
operator belonging to a same eigenvalue λ then a linear combination of φ1 and φ2 will also
be an eigenfunction of A with same eigenvalue λ.
One can easily verify that if φ is an eigenfunction of an operator A with the eigenvalue a
then φ is also an eigenfunction of the operators A2
, An and eA. What are the corresponding
eigenvalues? (See the exercise 11 at the end of this chapter.)

Its particular solutions are sin αr and cos αr. Then ψ = N(sin αr)/r and N(cos αr)/r. In
the limit r → 0, (sin αr)/r = α while (cos αr)/r → ∞. Therefore, we discard the solu￾tion N cos αr/r and choose the eigenfunctions as N sin αr/r, where N is the normalization
constant. The eigenvalues are −α
2 and form a continuous spectrum.
3.3 Commuting and Noncommuting Operators
In classical mechanics if we know some set of physical quantities such as (r, p) then certain
other quantities of interest can be determined. For example, given r and p one can determineCommuting and Noncommuting Operators 59
orbital angular momentum L = r × p. From the set of all dynamical variables many such
compatible subsets can be chosen. Their member is restricted by the Poisson brackets. If
the coordinates of a particle are denoted by x1, x2, x3 and momenta by p1, p2, p3 then the
Poisson bracket [3–5] of two functions f and g (which are functions of xi
’s and pi

. (3.17)
In quantum mechanics the Poisson bracket conditions are replaced by commutator brackets.
3.3.1 Definition, Identities and Examples
The operator AB − BA is called the commutator of A and B and is denoted [A, B]. The
properties of commutator brackets are similar to those of Poisson brackets. If [A, B] = 0,
that is, AB = BA, then the two operators A and B are said to be commuting operators;
otherwise noncommuting operators. For commuting operators their order of occurrence can
be freely changed. When AB = −BA the operators A and B are said to be anticommuting
operators.
The following identities can be easily verified:
[A, B] = − [B, A] , (3.18a)
[AB, C] = [A, C] B + A [B, C] , (3.18b)
[A, BC] = [A, B] C + B [A, C] , (3.18c)
[α1A + α2B, C] = α1 [A, C] + α2 [B, C] , (3.18d)
[A, α1B + α2C] = α1 [A, B] + α2 [A, C] , (3.18e)

The rule for the calculation of area of a rectangle of length l and breadth b is com￾mutative; l × b = b × l. However, there are certain mathematical operations which are
noncommutative. Let us consider the following two operations:
1. Move two steps in the forward direction. Call this operation as S.
2. Rotate by 90o
to right-side. Call this operation as R.
Suppose we stand in a room and perform the operations 1 and 2. Note down the final position
and it be P12. Next, we go to the starting position and perform the operations 2 and 1.
The position of us is say P21. Obviously, P21 is different from P12. That is, symbolically
SR =6 RS or SR − RS 6= 0. The operators S and R are noncommutative.
For the coordinate and momentum operators we have
[x, px] φ = (xpx) φ − (pxx) φ
= −i ~

x
∂φ
∂x −
∂
∂x(xφ)

= i ~φ . (3.19)
Thus, [x, px] = i~ which implies that the order of these operators cannot be changed.
What is the consequence of this relation? A consequence of it is that x(pxφ) =6 px(xφ),
where φ is a state of the system. That is, a position measurement followed by a momentum
measurement might give different result from a momentum measurement followed by a
position measurement.60 Operators, Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions
Similarly, we obtain
[y, py] = [z, pz] = i ~ , [px, x] = [py, y] = [pz, z] = −i ~ . (3.20)
Note that the conjugate pairs (x, px), (y, py) and (z, pz) do not commute. But for x, py we
have [x, py] = 0 so that the order of these operators can be changed without affecting the
result. Further,
[x, pz] = 0 , [y, px] = 0 , [y, pz] = 0 , [z, px] = 0 , [z, py] = 0 . (3.21)
3.3.2 Features of Commuting and Noncommuting Operators
There are three important features associated with commuting and noncommuting quantum
mechanical operators. They are given below:
1. If the operators A and B of two observables do not commute then they cannot
be measured simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy (for details see sec. 8.3).
2. If A and B are two commuting operators then the eigenfunctions of A (or B) are
also the eigenfunctions of B (A). (For a proof see sec. 3.3.3).
3. The expectation value of an operator commuting with the Hamiltonian H is a
constant of motion or time-independent. Later in sec. 7.2 we show that the time￾independency of expectation value of an operator A is governed by the equation
d
dt
hAi =

∂A
∂t 
+
i
~
h[H, A]i. (3.22)
If A has no explicit time-dependence then
d
dt
hAi =
i
~
h[H, A]i. (3.23)
When [H, A] = 0 we have dhAi/dt = 0. Hence, hAi of an operator commuting
with the Hamiltonian is a constant of motion. Further, for any time-independent
Hamiltonian operator dhHi/dt = 0 because of [H, H] = 0. Therefore, for any
system with time-independent Hamiltonian operator, energy is conserved.
In classical mechanics with respect to generalized position and momentum coordinates
q and p, the equation of motion is [3–5]
d
dt
f(q, p, t) = ∂f
∂t − {H, f} . (3.24)
Comparison of Eqs. (3.22) and (3.24) shows that the Poisson bracket of classical mechanics
corresponds to the commutator multiplied by −i/~.

Thus, [H, px] = i~mω2x for the linear harmonic oscillator. Since [H, px] 6= 0, hpxi is not
a constant of motion. For a free particle k = 0 and hence [H, px] = 0, that is, hpxi is a
constant of motion.
3.3.3 Simultaneous Eigenfunctions
Suppose A and B are two operators and φ is a function such that
Aφ = aφ , Bφ = bφ (3.27)
then φ is called a simultaneous eigenfunction of A and B belonging to the eigenvalues a
and b, respectively. The equation Aφ = aφ implies
BAφ = aBφ = abφ . (3.28)
Similarly, from Bφ = bφ we get
ABφ = bAφ = baφ . (3.29)
From Eqs. (3.28) and (3.29) we obtain
(AB − BA)φ = [A, B]φ = 0 . (3.30)
Therefore, if φ is a simultaneous eigenfunction of the operators A and B then [A, B] = 0. If
two operators A and B are commuting operators then they admit simultaneous eigenfunc￾tion. [A, B] = 0 is the necessary condition for φ to be a simultaneous eigenfunction of A and
B. In fact, it is also to be the sufficient condition. For a free particle [H, px] = 0. Hence, the
operators H = −(~
2/2m)d2/dx
2 and px = −i~d/dx have same set of eigenfunctions. (Verify
this with the solutions of the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation of the free particle).
Suppose A and B are commuting operators and φ
(1)
a and φ
(2)
a are two linearly inde￾pendent eigenfunctions of A with the same eigenvalue a. Then there is a state with two
different eigenfunctions but with same eigenvalue. This state is said to be doubly degener￾ate. We write Aφ(1)
a = aφ(1)
a , Aφ(2)
a = aφ(2)
a and Bφ(1)
a = b1φ
(1)
a . We have BAφ(1)
a = ab1φ
(1)
a
and ABφ(1)
a = b1aφ(1)
a . Then (AB − BA)φ
(1)
a = 0. That is,
ABφ(1)
a = BAφ(1)
a = aBφ(1)
a
. (3.31)
Bφ(1)
a is an eigenfunction of A with eigenvalue a. As φ
(1)
a and φ
(2)
a are eigenfunctions of A
with eigenvalue a we write Bφ(1)
a ∝ φ
(1)
a and Bφ(1)
a ∝ φ
(2)
a . φ
(1)
a is not an eigenfunction of
B. That is we cannot claim that Bφ(1)
a is ∝ φ
(1)
a . Though φ
(1)
a and φ
(2)
a may be degenerate
eigenfunctions of the operator A, they need not be degenerate eigenfunctions of the operator
B which commutes with A.62 Operators, Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions
Next, consider ψ+ = αφ(1)
a + βφ(2)
a which is an eigenfunction of B with eigenvalue b. ψ+
is also an eigenfunction of A with the eigenvalue a. Then Aψ+ = aψ+ and Bψ+ = bψ+.
Then (AB − BA)ψ+ = 0 gives
ABψ+ = BAψ+ = aBψ+ . (3.32)
That is, Bψ+ is an eigenfunction of A with eigenvalue a and Bψ+ ∝ ψ+. Similarly, Bψ− ∝
ψ−. Note that ψ+ and ψ− of B may correspond to different eigenvalues. Therefore, if φ

φ

a , . . ., φ
(m)
a are m-fold degenerate eigenfunctions of an operator A with an eigenvalue
a and [A, B] = 0 then linear combinations of m-fold eigenfunctions form simultaneous
eigenfunctions of A and B.
3.4 Self-Adjoint and Hermitian Operators
In this section, we introduce the adjoint, self-adjoint and Hermitian operators.
3.4.1 Definition
Consider the integral
(φ1, Aφ2) = Z ∞
−∞
φ
∗
1Aφ2 dτ (3.33)
which involves two different functions, φ1 and φ2, and A is an operator. For an operator A
one can always find another operator A†
(A-dagger) called the adjoint of A such that
(φ1, Aφ2) = ￾
A
†φ1, φ2

that is, R ∞
−∞ φ
∗
1Aφ2 dτ =
R ∞
−∞ ￾
A†φ1
∗
φ2 dτ. As far as the value of the integral is concerned
it does not matter whether A acts on φ2 or its adjoint A† acts on other function φ1. When
A† = A the operator A is said to be self-adjoint. A self-adjoint operator with certain
boundary conditions on the eigenfunctions is called Hermitian2
.
When an operator A is self-adjoint then
(φ1, Aφ2) = (Aφ1, φ2) . (3.35)
An interesting feature of a self-adjoint (Hermitian) operator is that the expectation value of
the corresponding dynamical variable is real as shown below. When A† = A and φ1 = φ2 = φ
using Eqs. (3.34) and (3.35) we get
hAi =

∗
. (3.36)
hAi is thus real. If the operator of a dynamical variable is self-adjoint then the possible
values of the variable are only real. In an experiment, the result of any single measurement
of a variable is necessarily a real number. Therefore, self-adjoint operators are suitable for
representing observable dynamical variables.
If (φ1, Aφ2) = −(Aφ1, φ2) then A is said to be anti-self-adjoint (or anti-Hermitian). In
this case hAi = −hAi
∗ − the expectation value of an anti-self-adjoint operator is always a
pure imaginary.
2Usually, self-adjoint operators are also called Hermitian. However, there is a distinction between these
two operators. The difference lies in the domain of the operators. For details see appendixSelf-Adjoint and Hermitian Operators 63
3.4.2 Examples
In an experiment position and momentum of a particle can be measured and hence their
operators must be self-adjoint. The position operator is obviously self-adjoint. For the mo￾mentum operator we have

x = px. Thus, px = −i~d/dx is a self-adjoint
operator. But the operator A = d/dx is not a self-adjoint. For this operator we have

this boundary condition φk(x) = eikx = eik(x+L)

3.4.3 Properties of Self-Adjoint Operators
Some of the properties of self-adjoint operators are given below with necessary proofs.
1. The eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator are real.
Proof:
Let A be a self-adjoint operator and φa and φa′ be two eigenfunctions of it so
that
Aφa = aφa , Aφa′ = a
′φa′ . (3.41)

φ
∗
aφa dx = 0 . (3.44)
The integral in the above equation is the norm of φa and it should be nonzero
and finite. Therefore, we have a
∗ = a, a is real.
2. Any two eigenfunctions belonging to distinct eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator
are mutually orthogonal.
Proof:
Because of a

(a

aφa′ dx = 0 . (3.45)

Assume that A and B are two self-adjoint operators. If the product operator AB
is a self-adjoint then (φ, ABφ2) = (ABφ1, φ2):

From Eqs. (3.46) and (3.47) we find AB = BA. That is, [A, B] = 0.
4. Because of [A, An
] = 0 and the property (3) any power of a self-adjoint operator
is also a self-adjoint operator .
5. A linear combination of two or more self-adjoint operators is also a self-adjoint
operator . The proof of it is left as an exercise to the reader.
6. Self-adjoint operators can be used to generate a unitary transformation, e
iAθ. This
will be discussed in secs. 6.4 and 11.2.
Operators of observables such as position, linear momentum, angular momentum and
energy−all are self-adjoint and they satisfy the above properties. Real eigenvalues are not
restricted to self-adjoint operators alone. There are nonself-adjoint operators with all eigen￾values being real. For example, it has been shown that the eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian

3.5 Discrete and Continuous Eigenvalues
In order to treat a dynamical variable A as an observable the operator representing it
must be Hermitian so that hAi = real. Another requirement is that the eigenfunction of the
operator should form a complete set. The eigenfunctions {φa} of the self-adjoint operator
A are said to form a complete set if any arbitrary wave function ψ of the system can be
expressed into a linear combination
ψ =
X
a∈D
caφa +
Z
a∈C
caφa da . (3.50)
of the members of the set3
. In Eq. (3.50) the summation is over the discrete part of the
eigenvalue spectrum and integration is over the continuous part. Any dynamical variable
represented by a Hermitian operator having a complete set of eigenfunctions is called an
observable.
Let us normalize the wave function ψ assuming that all the eigenvalues of the operator
A are discrete. We have

In the language of linear vector space, this complete set of vectors φa span the infinite-dimensional
vector space known as Hilbert space. In this space any arbitrary vector ψ can be represented as the linear
combination of these basis vector with the expansion coefficients being the coordinates of the vectors. These
coordinates form column matrix which represents the vector ψ. Then any operation on ψ is represented as
an infinite-dimensional matrix. Diagonalization of this matrix gives the eigenvalues and eigenvectors which
are the basis of Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics66 Operators, Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions

The eigenfunctions are nonnormalizable. Thus, the eigenfunctions belonging to continuous
eigenvalues are nonnormalizable.

the eigenvalue spectrum has both discrete and continuous parts then the normalization

In connection with the eigenvalue problems, the following questions may be raised. If we
assign an arbitrary real value to a in the eigenvalue equation Aφa = aφa does there exist a
corresponding eigenfunction φa? The answer is negative. This is because the solution of the
eigenvalue equation has to satisfy the physical admissibility conditions. Therefore, only for
specific values of a eigenfunctions exist. The next question to be discussed is whether there
can be more than one eigenfunction for a particular eigenvalue. It is quite possible for a set
of eigenfunctions to have same eigenvalue. If there exists only one eigenfunction belonging
to a given eigenvalue, the eigenvalue is said to be nondegenerate; otherwise, it is degenerate.Meaning of Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions 67
If φa and χa belong to the same eigenvalue a, for the operator A, then the linear
combination ψ = c1φa + c2χa is also an eigenfunction of the operator A with the same
eigenvalue a. We can construct an infinite number of eigenfunctions corresponding to any
degenerate eigenvalue. If there are r-linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to
a particular degenerate eigenvalue, we say that the eigenvalue is r-fold degenerate.
3.6 Meaning of Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions
In connection with the eigenvalues (a), eigenfunctions (φa) and the normalized wave function
(ψ) we ask the following questions: What are actually a, φa, ca and ψ? What do they
represent in a quantum mechanical system? Can we measure them in an experiment? The
aim of this section is to give precise answers to these questions.
Recall the experiment of throwing a die of six sides considered in sec. 2.9. Let it be
thrown a very large number of times, say N times. The average or mean or expectation
value of an outcome of a throw of the die is given by
houtcomei =
XP(a)a , a = 1, 2, . . . , 6, (3.60)
where P(a) is the probability of getting a as an outcome. The formula, Eq. (3.60), is not
only for the throw of a die but also for outcome of any experiment. In quantum mechanics
for the position measurement we write
hxi =
XP(x)x =

For an observable A we can write
hAi =

Comparing the Eqs. (3.60) and (3.63) we infer that a in the eigenvalue equation Aφa = aφa
is a possible outcome of an experiment. Suppose we measure the energy of a system. We
get a number. This number is one of the possible energy eigenvalues. In the experiment,
we say that the outcome of energy measurement is the energy value of the system. In the
theory, we call a possible energy value as an energy eigenvalue. The physical significance
of the eigenvalues of an operator of an observable is that they are the possible results of
measurement of an observable. Eigenvalues can be measured in an experiment.68 Operators, Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions
Comparing Eqs. (3.60) and (3.63) we find that |ca|
2 = P(a). The absolute square of
the coefficient ca in the expansion of ψ in terms of eigenfunctions of the operator A is
the probability that a measurement of A will yield the eigenvalue a. ca is the probability
amplitude.
We note that quantum theory does not give exact value of an observable of a particle
at a time. Rather, it gives various possible values of the observable and their corresponding
probabilities. Each eigenfunction is associated with each possible value of the observable.
That is, quantum states are described by the mathematical functions called eigenfunctions.
Operating the corresponding operator A of the observable on an eigenfunction φa we get
the corresponding eigenvalue a. If the value of the observable is a
′
then we say that the
system is in an eigenstate φa′ . In quantum theory all possible (eigen)states are combined
together with complex number ca weighings as
ψ =
X
a
caφa , (3.64)
where the eigenvalues are assumed to be discrete. This collection of all possible states with
complex number weighings is called the wave function and it describes arbitrary quantum
state of the particle. Generally, φa is a particular state of the system and ψ is the arbitrary
state of the system. Further, φa is a physically realizable state. In an experiment a system
can be found in the stationary eigenstate φa. However, ψ is not a physically realizable
stationary state. In fact, ψ given by Eq. (3.50) or (3.64) is not a solution of the eigenvalue
equation Aψ = λψ (why?). Then, what does ψ represent? ψ states the various possible
eigenstates and their corresponding probabilities. What do you infer if ψ of a system is
c1φ1 + c2φ2 while ψ of another system is c1φ1 + c2φ2 + c3φ3, where φi
’s are stationary state
eigenfunctions?
ca can be called as the A-space wave function just ψ(x) is called the coordinate space or
configuration space wave function. ca may be used instead of ψ for describing the state since
ψ can be obtained from ca through Eq. (3.64). That is, ca and ψ are different representations
of the same state.
3.7 Parity Operator
Suppose P is an operator such that for any function φ(x), P φ(x) = φ(−x). Then
P
2φ = P P φ(x) = P φ(−x) = φ(x). (3.65)
The operator P is called a parity operator . We find that P
2 = 1. The operator P reverses x
to −x and p into −p etc. When P φ(X) = φ(X) then P reverses X to −X and is equivalent
to a reflection in x − y plane followed by a rotation of π about the z-axis.
3.7.1 Properties of the Parity Operator
The operator P has the following properties:
1. Eigenvalues of P are ±1.
2. For a symmetric potential [P, H] = 0.
3. Expectation value of P is a constant of motion.
4. P is Hermitian and linear.
5. P xopP = −xop , P popP = −pop.Parity Operator 69
We now prove the above properties. To find the eigenvalues of P assume that φλ is an
eigenfunction of P corresponding to the eigenvalue λ. Then
P φλ = λφλ , P2φλ = P λφλ = λ
2φλ . (3.66)
But according to Eq. (3.65) P
2φλ must be φλ. Therefore, λ
2 = 1 or λ = ±1. When λ = 1
we have P φλ = φλ and the operator P is called an even parity operator . When λ = −1 we
have P φλ = −φλ and the operator P is called an odd parity operator . Any function which
is even, that is φ(x) = φ(−x), is an eigenfunction of parity operator with eigenvalue +1.
Similarly, any odd function of x, φ(x) = −φ(−x), is an eigenfunction of parity operator
with eigenvalue −1. The spherical harmonics Y
m
l
(θ, φ) are examples of eigenfunctions of a
parity operator.
For any symmetric potential V (x, y, z) = V (−x, −y, −z) the parity operator commutes
with H. It is a constant of motion. Further, P has even or odd parity. Therefore, a system
with symmetric potential will be described by eigenfunctions with even or odd parity. In
central force field problems V (r) = V (
p
x
2 + y
2 + z
2). The potential is symmetric with
respect to parity operator. An eigenfunction for a central force problem in spherical po￾lar coordinates will contain the radial part Rnl(r) and the spherical part Y
m
l
(θ, φ) (see
sec. 12.2). Since Rnl has even parity, the total parity of the state is given by the spherical
harmonics Y
m
l
(θ, φ).
In spherical polar coordinates, the parity operator causes r → r, θ → π − θ, φ → π + φ.
We can easily show that P Y m
l = (−1)lY
m
l
. Eigenfunctions with φ(r) = φ(−r) and φ(r) =
−φ(−r) are said to have even parity and odd parity, respectively. The significance of even
parity is that the waves travelling to the left and right described by ψ(r) have the same
energy. One can easily verify that P commutes with Lz and L
2 given by Eqs. (11.27c) and
(11.28), respectively. Since Y
m
l
(θ, φ) are the eigenfunctions of L
2 and Lz (see sec. 11.3.2),
they are also the eigenfunctions of P.
We notice that parity is quantum mechanical and has no classical analogue as there is no
classical dynamical variable from which it can be obtained by the operator correspondence
r → rop and p → −i~∇.
3.7.2 Commutator of P and H
For a reflection symmetric potential V (x), P V (x) = V (x). Further, P Hφ(x) = Hφ(−x) =
HP φ(x) which implies [P, H] = 0. Thus, for symmetric potentials P and H are commut￾ing operators and they have simultaneous eigenfunctions. Further, dhPi/dt = 0 because
[P, H] = 0 (see, Eq. (3.23)). Let us verify the relation [P, H] = 0 for the linear harmonic
oscillator potential V (x) = kx2/2. We obtain
P Hφ(x) = P

which implies [P, H] = 0.
There is an another parity operator called time reversal parity which reverses time
coordinate and is denoted as T . It does not satisfy the eigenvalue equation T φ(t) = αφ(t) =
φ(−t) but T φ(t) = φ
∗
(t). T transforms px into −px and x into x and i → −i. It preserves
the relation [x, px] = i~.70 Operators, Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions

Solved Problem 5:
How do the parity operators act on the position and momentum operators?
Suppose we operate P xopP on φ(x). We get
(P xopP) φ(x) = (P xop) φ(−x) = P(xφ(−x)) = −xφ(x) = −xopφ(x). (3.69)
Therefore, P xopP = −xop. Similarly, we can show that P pxopP = −pxop.
3.7.3 All Hermitian Hamiltonians Have Parity
Let us consider a Hermitian Hamiltonian, for example,
H =
1
2
p
2
x +
1
3
x
3 +
1
4
x
4
. (3.70)
This Hamiltonian is symmetric under the operation of time reversal operator T . A parity
operator for a Hermitian Hamiltonian can be constructed as follows [12].
Given a Hamiltonian like that in Eq. (3.70) we can in principle solve the time￾independent Schr¨odinger equation Hφn(x) = Enφn(x). Now, we consider a new operator
P(x, y) given by
P(x, y) = X∞
n=0
(−1)nφn(x)φ
∗
n(y). (3.71)
The operator P has the following four properties:
1. P is linear and Hermitian.
2. P commutes with H and hence it is conserved.
3. P
2 = 1, that is, in coordinate space
Z ∞
−∞
P(x, z)P(z, y) dz = δ(x − y). (3.72Some Other Useful Operators 71
4. By virtue of orthonormality φn is an eigenfunction of P with the eigenvalue (−1)n,
that is,
Z ∞
−∞
P(x, z)φn(z) dz = (−1)nφn(x). (3.73)
Because of the properties 3 and 4 the operator P exhibits the characteristics of the
parity operator even though the Hamiltonian may not be symmetric under space reflection.
If the potential V (x) of the Hamiltonian H = p
2
x
/(2m) + V (x) is invariant under the
transformation x → −x then P(x, y) is the usual parity operator.
We can follow the above procedure for constructing many differential operators that
commute with H. For example, we can construct a tri-parity operator Q(x, y)
Q(x, y) = X∞
n=0
ω
nφn(x)φ
∗
n
(y), (3.74)
where ω = e±i2π/3 and ω
3 = 1. However, Q(x, y) is not an observable. Why?
3.8 Some Other Useful Operators
In addition to Hermitian and parity operators there are other operators which play impor￾tant role in quantum theory. We define some of these operators in this section.
3.8.1 Identity and Unitary Opeators
An operator I is said to be identity if Iφ = φ. The effect of I on φ is to leave it as such. That
is, the operator I does not change anything. The square of the parity operator, P
2
, is an
identity operator. Suppose A and B are two operators such that Aφ1 = φ2 and Bφ2 = φ1,
where φ1 and φ2 are two functions of x. We obtain
BAφ1 = Bφ2 = φ1 , ABφ2 = Aφ1 = φ2 . (3.75)
The effect of AB on φ2 is to leave it as such and so AB = I. Since we can write AA−1 =
A−1A = I and hence B = A−1
: the operator B is the inverse of the operator A and vice￾versa. The operator (A − zI)
−1
, where I is the unit operator and z is a complex number
called the resolvent operator of the operator A [13].
An operator U with the property U
† = U
−1
is called a unitary operator . Since UU −1 = 1
we have UU† = 1 or U
†U = 1. In this case the operator U behaves like a transformation.
For any two eigenfunctions we get (φ1, φ2) = (φ1, U†Uφ2) = (Uφ1, Uφ2) which shows that
the action of U on eigenfunctions preserve their norm. That is, Uφ and φ both have the
same norm which means the net probability is unchanged by the unitary transformation U.
Since P
2φ = φ we write P
2 = 1 or P = P
−1
. Because of UU† = 1 where U is a unitary
operator we note that P
† = P, hence P
−1 = P
† and P is a unitary.
3.8.2 Parity-Time Reversal Symmetric Hamiltonian
There exists a class of eigenvalue problems, the so-called parity-time reversal (PT )-
symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian problems. They have arisen in recent years in a
number of physical contexts such as localization transitions, vortex pinning and population72 Operators, Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions
biology [14–16]. Such non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can be used to describe certain exper￾imental phenomena. They have been used for Bose system of hard sphere [17], complex
Toda lattice [18] and field theory models [19–22]. PT -symmetry has been noticed in certain
optical systems, such as optical couplers, microwave billiard and large-scale temporal lat￾tices [23]. An optical system with periodic complex refractive index is essentially equivalent
to a time-periodic non-Hermitian quantum system. A necessary condition for an optical
structure to be PT -symmetric is that its complex refractive index distribution becomes
n(x) = n
∗
(−x). In this case the real part of the index profile is symmetric in space while
the imaginary component (gain-loss) is antisymmetric [24]. It has been shown that induc￾tively coupled two LRC circuits exhibit all the salient features of non-Hermitian systems
which commute with PT operator [25,26].
A PT -symmetric Hamiltonian is a Hamiltonian, which is invariant under the product
of the parity operator, that is, P(: x → −x), and the time reversal operation, that is,
T (: i → −i). For example, the operator
H = −
d
2
dx
2
+ α
￾
x
2

− (ix)
2n+1
, (3.76)
where α(x
2
) is a polynomial of degree n ≥ 1 with positive real coefficients, is PT -symmetric.
A simple example is H = p
2
x/(2m) + ix
3
. The parity operator P is linear and has the effect
of px → −px, x → −x. The time-reversal operator T is anti-linear and has the effect
px → −px, x → x, i → −i.
An example of an operator which is not PT -symmetric is
H = −
d
2
dx
2
+ x − (ix)
3
. (3.77)
If H = −d
2/dx
2 + V (x) is PT -symmetric then V
∗
(−x) = V (x) and so ReV (x) is
an even function and ImV (x) is an odd function. Hence, if V (x) is a polynomial then
V (x) = P(x
2
) + ixQ(x
2
) for some real polynomials P and Q. It has been shown that the
PT -symmetric Hamiltonian H = −d
2/dx
2 + x
2 − g(ix)
3 has a discrete spectrum for g real
and the eigenvalues are real if g is small enough [27–28]. There are some PT -symmetric
Hamiltonians that have no eigenvalues [29] or no real eigenvalues [30]. For more details
about PT -symmetric Hamiltonians one may read refs. [14–33]. Some of the applications
of non-Hermitian PT -symmetric Hamiltonian have been reported in refs. [17, 18, 34]. It
is noteworthy to mention that PT -symmetric materials can exhibit power oscillations and
nonreciprocity of light propagation [35], absorption enhanced transmission and unidirec￾tional invisibility.
3.8.3 Time Operator
We note that in Schr¨odinger quantum mechanics time is considered as a parameter and
it can be chosen with any desired precision while the position variation is an operator.
ψ
∗
(x, t)ψ(x, t) gives the probability of finding a particle between x and x + dx at time t.
Operators for time have been discussed in differrent contexts [36–41]. Consider the time
arrival of a particle in a detector localized spatially. In this case one can define an operator
T for time so that [T, H] = i~. Denoting ψ(t) as the wave function of T we can write
T ψ(t) = tψ(t) in an analogy with xopψ(x) = xψ(x), where ψ(x) is the wave function of xop.
Observe that xop is Hermitian while T is non-Hermitian (verify). We have hψ(t)|T |ψ(t)i = t
and hψ(t)|T
2
|ψ(t)i = t
2
leading to the uncertainty ∆T = hT
2
i−hT i
2 = 0. That is, temporal
uncertainty becomes zero and time appears as a parameter that can be chosen arbitraryConcluding Remarks 73
3.9 Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we have seen that the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation is an eigen￾value equation. We have seen that the operators representing an observable must be a
Hermitian operator and discussed a few important properties of Hermitian operators. How
do we obtain an anti-Hermitian operator from a Hermitian operator? Multiplying it by i.
We note that the operator representing an observable should be (i) linear, (ii) Hermitian and
(iii) its eigenfunctions must form a complete set. It is easy to verify that the operators L and
H are Hermitian if the potential V (x, y, z) is real. Further, the parity operator P commutes
with Lz and L

. In chapters 4 and 5 we will consider some simple and physically interesting
quantum mechanical systems and solve the eigenvalue equations associated with them. We
will find that in some systems normalizable solutions occur with discrete eigenvalues while
in certain systems the solutions are nonnormalizable with continuous eigenvalues. Classi￾cal mechanics describes the dynamical variables as functions in phase space. We have seen
that in quantum mechanics, they are Hermitian operators. As all the operators in quantum
mechanics are linear operators, the state of a system is represented by a superposition of
eigenfunctions.

Exactly Solvable Systems I: Bound States
4.1 Introduction
Analytical solutions to the Schr¨odinger equation serve a variety of purposes. They help us
1. to identify the features of potentials and state functions,
2. to construct appropriate potentials from the experimental data and
3. to get analytical insight of the system considered.
The problem of solving a time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for a given time-dependent
potential is difficult. However, for some simple and physically interesting potentials the time￾independent Schr¨odinger equation is solvable exactly and the solutions are obtainable in
terms of well-known functions. Useful informations about a given system are extracted from
the solutions of time-independent Schr¨odinger equation. The time-independent Schr¨odinger
equation gives stationary state solutions which are independent of time. For a particle in
a one-dimensional potential V (x), the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation with H =
p
2
x
/(2m) + V (x) is given by
ψxx +
2m
~
2
(E − V (x))ψ = 0 , (4.1)
where the subscript x in ψ denotes differentiation with respect to x.
The eigenvalues of energy eigenstates can be discrete or continuous. The energy eigen￾states with discrete eigenvalues are called bound states because they correspond to the
classical bound orbits confined to a finite region in space. The bound state eigenfunctions
are normalizable. On the other hand, the energy eigenstates with continuous eigenvalues
are called unbound states or scattering states and they correspond to the classical unbound
orbits in which the particle approaches from and recedes to infinite distance. The eigen￾functions of scattering states are nonnormalizable.
The present chapter is primarily concerned with the study of bound states of some
simple one-dimensional systems. Study of bound systems and their bound states is very
important because atoms, molecules and other fundamental matters are bound systems and
their characteristics are understood by quantum mechanics. We consider a one-dimensional
linear harmonic oscillator, an anharmonic oscillator, a particle in a box, Morse oscillator,
P¨oschl–Teller potentials and pendulum system. Since free particle is the simplest quantum
mechanical system and form the starting point of the study of quantum systems we include
the study of it in this chapter even though its solutions are unbound. Determination of
eigenspectra of damped and forced linear harmonic oscillator is presented. In two-dimension
the linear harmonic oscillator and a particle in a box are discussed. The quantum mechanical
treatment of three-dimensional version of the above mentioned systems are easy to analyze
and are given as problems at the end of this chapter. However, we will consider the important
systems like rigid rotator and hydrogen atom. We solve the rigid rotator in this chapter while
the hydrogen atom will be explored in chapter 12. Potentials giving scattering states will
be analyzed in the next chapter.

The time evolution of stationary state eigenfunctions is easy to obtain. We illustrate this
with reference to linear harmonic oscillator. When the Schr¨odinger equation of a potential
is not exactly solvable we can study the solution by means of numerical techniques. In
chapter 23 we solve the time-independent and time-dependent Schr¨odinger equations of
certain systems numerically.
4.2 Classical Probability Distribution
How do we establish the connection between the Schro¨dinger wave function and the classical
motion of a particle for stationary state solutions? An approach is to compare the prob￾ability density PQM = |ψn(x)|
2 with a classical probability distribution PCM(x) [1]. Then
show that these probabilities approach each other in a locally averaged manner, in the limit
of large quantum number n. Let us describe the calculation of PCM(x) and PCM(p) for a
classical particle exhibiting periodic motion.
Consider a particle exhibiting a bounded periodic motion (with period τ) with E = H
= p
2
x
/(2m) + V (x). We have p
2
x
/(2m) = E − V (x). Since p
2
x
/(2m) must be greater than
or equal to zero, the classical motion is confined to the regions, where E − V (x) ≥ 0. The
points at which E − V (x) = 0, (or E = V (x)), are called classical turning points. At these
points the velocity of the particle vanishes and it turns back. Let us denote these points as
a and b. Then the particle will move back and forth between a and b. The time taken by
the particle for one traversal from a to b is half the period, τ /2. The time dt spend by the
particle in the small region, dx, near the point x is dt = dx/v(x), where v(x) is the speed.
The probability of finding the particle in dx region is ratio of dt and the time taken for one
traversal:
PCM(x) dx =
dt
τ /2
=
2
τ
dx
v
or PCM(x) = 2
τv
. (4.2)
The particle will spend more time in regions where its speed is low. Further, PCM given by
Eq. (4.2) is normalized (R b
a
PCM(x)dx = 1) . Using E = mv2/2 + V (x) for v in Eq. (4.2) we
obtain [1]
PCM(x) = 2
τ
r m
2(E − V (x)) . (4.3)
Solved Problem 1:
Find an expression for PCM(px).
The probability of measuring the classical particle with momentum px is
PCM(px) dpx =
dt
τ /2
=

. (4.4)
Since dpx/dt = F(x) = −dV /dx we have PCM(px) = 2/(τ|F|).
4.3 Free Particle
For a free particle the force is zero and hence the potential is a constant which can be
taken as 0 since a constant potential does not influence the dynamics of the system. A freeFree Particle 81
particle has significance in problems related to collision and metallic state. The Schr¨odinger
equation for the free particle is
ψxx + k
2ψ = 0, k2 = 2mE/~
2
. (4.5)
Its solution is
ψ = Ae
±ikx
, (4.6)
where A is a constant. This ψ(x) is always single-valued, finite and continuous for all values
of k. Hence, there is no restriction on the values of k and E. They can take continuous
values. But the ψ given by Eq. (4.6) is nonnormalizable! Why is this? What does it imply?
For the free particle the energy is always positive and the expectation value of kinetic
energy is E. What is the expectation value of momentum?
Let us calculate the flux with ψ = Ae
ikx. We have
J(x) = −

Classically, if ρ(x) is the spatial charge density of particles and v is the speed of the particles
then J(x) = vρ(x) = ρpx/m. Thus, ψ = Ae
ikx physically represents flow of particles.
In Eq. (4.6) for a given k or E there are two independent eigenfunctions: eikx and e−ikx
.
The energy eigenvalue corresponding to these eigenfunctions is thus degenerate. However,

The eigenfunctions eikx and e−ikx are orthogonal. How do we distinguish these degenerate
eigenfunctions? Operating ˆpx on them we have
pˆx e
±ikx = ˆpx e
ipxx/~ = ±px e
±ipxx/~
. (4.9)
The two eigenfunctions have the same energy but different momenta.
Instead of e±ikx, suppose consider the eigenfunctions sin kx and cos kx. Does pˆx distin￾guish them? The answer is no. Because ˆpx sin kx = −i~k cos kx, sin kx is not a momentum
eigenfunction. Therefore, ˆpx is not useful to distinguish them. However, as sin kx and cos kx
are odd and even functions of x, respectively, we can distinguish them by the parity operator.

4.4.1 Physical Systems Modelled by the Linear Harmonic Oscillator
The linear harmonic oscillator (LHO) is a fundamental system solved exactly in both clas￾sical and quantum mechanics. It is used in the modelling of subnuclear quarks to cos￾mic systems. Any system with small amplitude of vibration about its equilibrium point
is approximately described by LHO. Vibration of diatomic molecules is approximately a
LHO. Electrons restricted in three-dimensional electromagnetic traps are found to behave
as quantized harmonic oscillators. The LHO description is used in the study of probability
distribution of hadronic matter. The model is found to give a simple explanation for a wide
range of hadronic phenomena noticed in high energy physics experiments.

An oscillating electromagnetic field is similar to a LHO [2]. An electromagnetic wave at a
point in space can be considered as oscillating electric and magnetic fields or a collection of
photons. Consider a standing electromagnetic wave in a one-dimensional enclosure without
a source. An example is a resonant cavity of a laser. Suppose the enclosure is kept along
the x-axis. Its volume is, say V . The electric field is plane polarized parallel to the y-axis
and its angular frequency is ω. The strength of electric and magnetic fields are given by

Equations (4.19) and (4.20) are similar to the Eqs. (4.15) and (4.14), respectively.
There are two standard approaches to determine the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of
quantum LHO – one is differential and another is algebraic. First we take up the former.
4.4.2 Transformation of Schr¨odinger Equation to Hermite Equation
Equation (4.16) is a variable coefficient and linear ordinary differential equation. We do not
have a systematic method to construct exact analytical solutions of such equations. However,
the Schr¨odinger Eq. (4.16) can be transformed into the Hermite differential equation by
introducing a suitable change of variable and parameters. Writing ξ = αx, we have ψx =
ψξdξ/dx = αψξ and ψxx = α
2ψξξ, where α = dξ/dx. Then Eq. (4.16) becomes

(4.22)
we rewrite the Eq. (4.21) as
ψξξ +

λ − ξ
2

ψ = 0 . (4.23)
With the change of variable
ψ = H(ξ) e−ξ
2/2
(4.24)
Eq. (4.23) takes the form
Hξξ − 2ξHξ + (λ − 1)H = 0 . (4.25)
Redefining λ = 2n + 1 the above equation becomes the well-known Hermite differential
equation
Hξξ − 2ξHξ + 2nH = 0 . (4.26)
Equation (4.26) is not an exactly solvable equation. However, it admits a power series solu￾tion. We are seeking bound state solutions of (4.16): ψ(x) → 0 as x → ±∞. The particular
solutions which are finite in the interval −∞ < ξ < ∞ and decay to zero as ξ → ±∞ exist
for integer values of n and are called Hermite polynomials [3–5].
4.4.3 Eigenfunctions and Eigenvalues
The Hermite polynomial solutions of Eq. (4.26) are given by [3–5]
Hn(ξ) = (−1)n

The first few Hermite polynomials are
H0 = 1, H1 = 2ξ, H2 = 4ξ
2 − 2, H3 = 8ξ
3 − 12ξ . (4.28)
From Eq. (4.24) the eigenfunctions are obtained as
ψn(ξ) = NnHn(ξ) e−ξ
2/2
, (4.2984 Exactly Solvable Systems I: Bound States
where Nn’s are normalization constants. The substitution ξ = αx in Eq. (4.29) gives
ψn(αx) = ψn(x) = NnHn(αx) e−α
2x
2/2
. (4.30)
Thus, the eigenfunctions of LHO are Hermite polynomials times a Gaussian function and
are called Weber functions. The normalization condition gives

where ω =

k/m is the classical angular frequency of the oscillator. En’s are the only
stationary state energy levels of the oscillator.
Some of the features of a LHO are summarized below.
1. En’s are discrete because n is an integer and En depend on n. Hence, the quantum
LHO has a discrete energy spectrum. This is not true for the classical LHO since
an arbitrary amount of energy can be imparted to the classical system. We note
that the energy spectrum of a free particle is continuous.
2. The states represented by the eigenfunctions ψn are normalized and hence they
are bound states.
3. The energy difference between two successive energy levels is ~ω, a fixed value,
and thus the energy levels are equally spaced. This is due to the potential energy
function V (x) = kx2/2. This potential expands in such a manner that, as the
amplitude increases with energy the levels remain equally spaced.
4. The ground state energy obtained by substituting n = 0 is ~ω/2 and is nonzero.
This is known as zero-point energy. The classical minimum energy is zero. In con￾trast, quantum mechanically it is ~ω/2. This is because ψ0(x) does not minimize
V (x) alone but rather the sum of kinetic and potential energies.
5. What would happen if En = 0? If En = 0 then

6. Figure 4.1 shows first few eigenfunctions of LHO. ψn(−x) = ψn(x) for even values
of n while ψn(−x) = −ψn(x) for odd integer of n. Thus, the parity associated
with ψn is P = (−1)n.
7. ψn given by Eq. (4.30) are the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian operator H given
by Eq. (4.14) with the eigenvalues En. H is a Hermitian operator (verify). Earlier,
in sec. 3.4 we have shown that for a Hermitian operator eigenfunctions belonging
to distinct eigenvalues are mutually orthogonal. Therefore, the eigenfunctions of
LHO are orthogonal. We can verify the above using the ψn’s given by Eq. (4.30).Harmonic Oscillator 85

4.4.4 Classical and Quantum Mechanical Probabilities
The solution of the classical equation of motion (4.15) is x(t) = A sin(ωt + φ), where A and
φ are integration constants. The solution is periodic with period τ = 2π/ω. The maximum
amplitude of the solution is A and the turning points are +A and −A. The classical motion
is bounded between x = −A and +A, that is, −A ≤ x(t) ≤ A. Now, for the LHO Eq. (4.3)

the Figs. 4.2 and 4.3 we note that quantum mechanically there is a small probability in
the classical forbidden region. It is clear from these figures that the position probability
densities |ψn|

to the corresponding densities of the classical oscillation. The agreement between classical
and quantum probability densities improves with increase in n. The agreement is fairly

4.4.6 Selection Rules
It is possible to find the selection rules for the allowed transitions for LHO. We know from
classical electrodynamics, any oscillatory electric or magnetic multipole emits or absorbs
radiation. We can show that the presence of any electric or magnetic multipole matrix
elements between any two states results in induced absorption or emission of the electro￾magnetic wave. The electric dipole transition is the predominant one. Therefore, normally
selection rules are worked-out by considering the matrix element of electric dipole operation
er between the states involved in the transition. As shown in sec. 2.13, a transition between
two states characterized by the quantum numbers m and n is possible only if the condi￾tion (2.94) is satisfied. Selection rules for allowed transitions are obtained starting from the
recurrence relation of the Hermite polynomials
Hn+1 − 2ξHn + 2nHn−1 = 0 . (4.41)

mexψn dx is not equal to zero if m − n = ±1. Thus, transition can occur between
adjacent energy levels. Transitions between energy levels involve emission or absorption of
quanta of energy by the oscillator. When transition from level n to level n − 1 occurs then
∆E = En−1 − En = −~ω which is negative and hence energy is emitted by the oscillator.
For the transition from level n to level n + 1 we have ∆E = ~ω and therefore absorption
of energy by the oscillator takes place. A quantum mechanical system in its ground state
cannot radiate energy because there is no lower energy state for it to go.
4.4.7 Abstract Operator Method to Linear Harmonic Oscillator
Let us solve the LHO problem by the operator method.
First, we express H of LHO as H = BA + ǫ, where A and B are two new operators
functions of x and px and ǫ is a real constant. To determine them we assume that
A = c(W(x) + ipx), B = c(W(x) − ipx), (4.48)
where c and W(x) to be determined. Then we obtain
BA + ǫ = c

(W(x) − ipx)(W(x) + ipx) + ǫ

a = 1 . (4.56)
We expressed the H of LHO in terms of a and a
† as in Eq. (4.53). Thus, the problem
of finding the eigenvalues of H is reduced to the problem of finding the eigenvalues of a
†a.
Note that the two quadratic operators x
2 and p

x
in the Hamiltonian operator of the LHO
is converted into one squared form of the operators a
† and a and plus a constant (~ω/2).
The constant ~ω/2 does not affect the determination of the energy spectrum.

2ψn, . . . are the eigenfunctions of ˆn belonging to the eigenvalues (n + 1), (n +

2ψn, . . . are the
eigenfunctions of ˆn corresponding to the eigenvalues (n − 1), (n − 2), . . ., respectively. The
effects of a

essentially adds one quantum of energy while a removes one quantum of energy.Harmonic Oscillator 91
reason a
† and a are called raising and lowering operators or simply ladder operators. They
are also called creation and annihilation operators, respectively. These operators appear
particularly in fields of applied physics, where quantum mechanics is of primary importance.
The areas include lasers, nanometer scales devices and studies of electrical conduction in a
variety of devices.
Now, we find the range of eigenvalues of ˆn. Note that a

whether a is Hermitian or not. Further,

Comparison of (4.63a) and (4.63b) gives λ > 0. Thus, the eigenvalues of ˆn must be non￾negative. Therefore, (n − 1), (n − 2), . . . must be nonnegative and aψn, a
2ψn, . . . must
terminate. Suppose ψ0 is the last eigenfunction in the above set. Since the effect of a is to
decrease an eigenvalue by one, we have aψ0 = 0 and
a

aψ0 = 0 or ˆnψ0 = 0 . (4.64)
ψ0 is the eigenstate of a

We note that the Schr¨odinger Eq. (4.21) is second-order while the differential Eq. (4.70)
used in the operator algebra approach to determine the ground state eigenfunction is a
first-order equation. That is, the order of the equation to be solved to determine the energy
eigenfunction is reduced in the operator algebra method. Further, once ψ0 is known then
ψn is obtained by operating (a

)
n on ψ0, that is, by means of differentiation.
From Eq. (4.53) we write ~ωa†a = H +E0, where E0 = ~ω/2 is the ground state energy.
a
†a measures the number of energy quanta (photons) present above the ground state and
hence is called number operator . The energy eigenstates are also eigenstates of this operator
and are thus often called number states. There is a straightforward interpretation of the
above formalism for the radiation field. Each quantum of energy, ~ω, represents a photon.
The eigenstates ψn represents a system with n photons. The ground state is the vacuum
state (no photons) with nonzero energy ~ω/2. The operators a
† and a represent the physical
processes by which photons are absorbed or emitted. Therefore, a
† and a are called creation
and annihilation operators, respectively. Does an operator of an observable of a conservative
system contain a or a
† alone? Why?

We consider a particle of mass m, moving along the x-axis with the potential energy function
V (x) = Axn, where A is a constant [7]. As n increases V (x) becomes more and more flat￾bottomed and the sides become steeper and steeper near the turning points. For very large
n the V (x) approximates a square-well or box potential. It is of interest to know the change
in the energy levels due to deformation of V (x). For convenience, we rewrite the potential

The boundary conditions are ψ(0) = finite and ψ → 0 as |u| → ∞. When k = 1, Eq. (4.74)
becomes the LHO Eq. (4.2Particle in a Box 93
For k → ∞, the boundary conditions become ψ(u) = 0 for |u| ≥ 1 and Eq. (4.74) reduces
to
ψuu + λψ = 0, |u| ≤ 1 (4.75)
Its solution subjected to the boundary conditions ψ(±1) = 0, ψ(0) = 1 is
ψ0(u) = (

(4.76)
where √
λ0 = π/2. Though the solution of Eq. (4.74) for arbitrary p is not known, we get
approximate solution for large k. For this purpose w = u
k+1/(k+1) or u = [(k + 1)w]
1/(k+1)
.
We assume solution of the form
ψ(u) = e−wf(u). (4.77)

For large p and |u| < 1, the terms containing u

whose solution is given by Eq. (4.76). Thus,
ψ(u) = e−w cos √
λ u (4.79)
is an approximate solution of Eq. (4.74). For large k, e−w is almost constant at 1 until u
is close to 1, so the variation of ψ is described by the cosine function. For u ≫ 1, e−w in
Eq. (4.79) is dominant and the eigenfunction very rapidly decays to zero. Near u ≈ 1 we
obtain
ψ(w) = e−w cos h√

For k ≫ 1, w

of a cold white dwarf star is modelled by balancing the dynamics of electrons, represented
as particles in a box, with the gravitational forces. This model has predicted the stellar
mass threshold for final collapse of a white dwarf to a black hole. The electrons in metals
are also modelled by particles in a three-dimensional box potential. This model explains the
motion of conduction electrons and their contribution to magnetism and specific heat. It is
now possible to manufacture a box trapping electrons in a few nanometers-wide region. The
box potential is a good description for one-dimensional bound-state problems, when the
confining potential is much steeper compared to the parabolically curved LHO potential.
4.6.1 Classical Result
The particle is confined between the two walls of the potential and bounces elastically
when it incidents on the walls. The problem is a bound state problem. The total energy is
E = mv2/2. The classical equation of motion is ¨x = 0, |x| < a. Its solution is x(t) = At+B.
The choice x(0) = 0 gives x(t) = At and A is the velocity v of the particle. The particle
starting from x = 0 moves towards x = a with velocity v. Its trajectory is a straight-line
as shown in the subplot of Fig. 4.5. When the particle reaches x = a, it turns back with
the velocity −v and proceeds towards −a. At x = −a, it turns back towards +a with +v
and so on. The turning points are −a and a. The distance the particle traverses to come
back to the origin with velocity v is 4a. Therefore, the period of motion is τ = 4a/|v|. The
fundamental frequency f (in Hertz) is 1/τ (and ω = 2πf, where ω is in rad/sec).
The solution is written as [1]

4.6.2 Quantum Mechanical Result
The Schr¨odinger equation for |x| ≤ a is given by
ψxx + k
2ψ = 0, k2 = 2mE/~
2
. (4.86)
For |x| > a, ψ(x) = 0. The solution of Eq. (4.86) is
ψ(x) = A sin kx + B cos kx . (4.87)
This solution must satisfy the boundary conditions ψ(a) = 0, ψ(−a) = 0. Applying the
boundary conditions the following equations are obtained:
A sin ka + B cos ka = 0 , −A sin ka + B cos ka = 0 . (4.88)
For nontrivial solutions (A 6= 0 or B 6= 0) the condition is the determinant of the coefficient
matrix must be zero:




sin ka cos ka
− sin ka cos ka




= 0 . (4.89)
This gives sin 2ka = 0. In other words
k =
nπ
2a
, n = 1, 2, . . . . (4.90)
Thus, the allowed values of ka are discrete. Since k is related to E in Eq. (4.86) E becomes
discrete. Since ~k is the momentum we write pxn = ~kn = nπ~/(2a). The news is that px
is discrete. For a free particle px is continuous. From the Eqs. (4.88) with kn = nπ/(2a) we
obtain
2A sin(nπ/2) = 0, 2B cos(nπ/2) = 0 . (4.91)
When n is an odd integer (n = 1, 3, . . .) A = 0 while B is arbitrary. For even integer values
of n, n = 2, 4, . . ., A is arbitrary and B = 0. Thus, Eqs. (4.88) lead to the following two
cases.
Case 1:
A = 0, B 6= 0, ka =
nπ
2
, n = 1, 3, . . . (odd n). (4.92)96 Exactly Solvable Systems I: Bound States
Case 2:
A 6= 0, B = 0, ka =
nπ
2
, n = 2, 4, . . . (even n). (4.93)
(n = 0 is not acceptable. Why?)
The discreteness of n has an immediate significance. For example, for a string fixed at
the ends x = ±a we have 2π/λ = nπ/(2a), giving λ = 4a/n, n = 1, 2, . . .. The result is
certain wavelengths alone are allowed. In other words, only certain frequencies of vibrations
are allowed. This is the quantization of frequency. The waves oscillate more rapidly as n
increases. For a particle in a box, the de Broglie wavelengths are λn = 4a/n, n = 1, 2, . . ..
The lowest energy of the particle in the box potential is not zero. If it is zero v = 0 and
hence λ = h/mv = ∞. But there is no way to reconcile an infinite wavelength to the particle
in a box.
The features of a particle in a box are listed in the following:
1. From Eqs. (4.86) and (4.90) the energy levels are obtained as
En =
n
2~
2π
2
8ma2
, n = 1, 2, . . . . (4.94)
There are infinite number of energy levels. However, the energy levels are discrete
or quantized. The lowest energy is E1 = ~
2π
2/(8ma2
) which is nonzero. The
particle will make to and fro motion in the box in the region −a to a even at
absolute zero temperature. E1 is the zero-point energy.
2. The energy difference between the successive levels is
△En = En+1 − En =
(2n + 1)~
2π
2
8ma2
. (4.95)
The energy levels are not equally spaced. En are proportional to n
2
so they are
close at lower energy levels than at higher levels.
3. The momentum of the particle is px = ~πn/(2a) and En ∝ 1/a2
. Therefore,
squeezing a particle increases its momentum and the total energy.
4. Because of discreteness of energy spectrum we discretize ψ, k, A and B and
rewrite Eq. (4.87) as
ψn(x) = (
An sin knx, kn = nπ/(2a), n = 2, 4, . . .
Bn cos knx, kn = nπ/(2a), n = 1, 3, . . . .
(4.96)
These eigenfunctions are normalizable. Applying the normalization condition for
ψn with even n we get 1 = R a

n
sin2
knx dx = A2
na. Thus, An = 1/
√
a . Simi￾larly, for odd n Bn = 1/
√
a .
5. For |x| < a the values of x at which ψ vanishes is called a node. For odd n the
nodes are x = ±a/m, m = 1, 3, . . . , n. For even n the nodes are x = 0, ±2a/m,
m = 2, 4, . . . , n. For n = 1 the nodes are x = ±a and for n = 2 they are 0, ±a.
For a given state the number of nodes is n + 1.
6. Because cos(−x) = cos x, the eigenfunction for an odd n is symmetric with respect
to x = 0. Since sin(−x) = − sin x, ψ is anti-symmetric about x = 0 for even n.
Adjacent states have opposite symmetry. For even n, P ψn(x) = ψn(x). Therefore,
sin(nπx/2a) and cos(nπx/2a) are also the eigenfunctions of the parity operator.Particle in a Box 97

is depicted in Fig. 4.6. For large value of n, the cos2
term in Eq. (4.97) averages
to 1/2 showing that PQM approaches the classical limit 1/2a.
8. A transition between a pair of states with the quantum numbers n and n
′
is
allowed if one of the numbers is even and the other is odd, that is △n = ±1.
Transitions between two odd or even quantum numbers states is forbidden.
9. Since V (x) = V (−x) we have [P, H] = 0, where P is the parity operator. The
parity of the eigenfunctions of a particle in a box will not change in time.
10. Let us describe the time dynamics in the infinite height potential with an analogy
to the classical wave propagation on a stretched string of length L. Assume that
ψ(x) = Pcnψn(x) be the initial profile of a stretched string which then propagate
without dispersion at speed v =
p
2E¯
n/m, where E¯
n is the mean energy level. The
elastic collisions at the infinitely high potential barriers are analogous to perfect
reflections from the fixed ends of the string. When a wave form propagating on
a string is reflected at the string ends, it travels in the opposite direction with a
change of phase π in its amplitude. Its analogous behaviour is found in the box
potential [8].
Consider ψ
∗
1ψ1 in Fig. 4.6. A classical interpretation of the ground state function sug￾gests that because there is no possibility of finding the particle next to a wall, the particle
travels at an infinite speed immediately before and after hitting the wall, but travels com￾paratively slowly at the centre of the box. So although there are no forces inside the box the
particle appears to speed up and slow down. The first excited state is even more difficult
to understand classically because at the centre of the box there is no possibility of finding
the particle. Thus, classically the particle moves through this region at an infinite speed.98 Exactly Solvable Systems I: Bound States
The eigenstates given by the Eqs. (4.94) and (4.96) are the stationary states of the system
with energy eigenvalue being constant, independent of the space variable x. A nonstationary

In the domain of our everyday experience, we do not feel the quantum effects, since
on macroscopic scale they are imperceptible. Suppose a ball of mass 10 g is rolling on a
smooth floor of 10cm wide box with a speed of 3.3 cm/sec. The permitted energies for the
ball according to Eq. (4.94) are En = 5.49 × 10−57n
2
erg. The kinetic energy of the ball is
54.4 ergs. This corresponds to the energy level of quantum number n = 1029. This is very
large. Therefore, it is practically impossible to find whether the ball is in the energy states
n = 1029 or 1029 + 1, 1029 + 2, . . ., etc. (discrete). Therefore, we say that continuous range
of energy is possible.

4.7 Morse Oscillator
The Morse oscillator was introduced as a useful model for the interatomic potential and
fitting the vibrational spectra of diatomic molecules. It is also used to describe the photo￾dissociation of molecules, multi-photon excitation of the diatomic molecules in a dense
medium or in a gaseous cell under high-pressure and pumping of a local mode of a polyatomic
molecule by an infrared laser [10–13].100 Exactly Solvable Systems I: Bound States

4.9 Quantum Pendulum
A rigid pendulum is a point particle restricted to a circular radius and subjected to a
uniform gravitational or electric field. Classical and quantum versions of this system are
interesting. At low energies the potential energy of a quantum pendulum is approximated
by that of a harmonic oscillator and for high energies it is thought of as the free rotor [17].
The dynamics of the quantum pendulum are closely related to molecular motions known as
hindered rotations. The system is used to describe almost free rotations in ethene (C2H2)
and low energy torsional vibrations in K2PtCl6 (potassium hexachloroplatinate) [18].
4.9.1 Classical Result
Consider a point particle of mass m restricted to a circle of radius l. It has a rotational inertia
I = ml2
. The system is subjected to a uniform gravitational force (mg) (or electric force QE)
in the vertical direction. The corresponding potential energy function is V (θ) = −V0 cos θ
where V0 = mgl (or QEl). The classical Hamiltonian is
H = E =
I

The classical equation of motion is
¨θ +

sin θ = 0 . (4.131)
Assuming ˙θ(0) = 0 when θ(0) = θmax where θmax = cos−1

Eq. (4.131) is given by [19]

For −V0 < E < V0 the motion will be periodic with ˜θ = ± cos−1

points. Then the classical period is

For low energies (small oscillations), with −V0 ≤ E ≪ V0 or ˜θ ≪ 1, the motion is oscillator￾like. In this case the time period is τ = 2π/p
V0/ml2, which is independent of energy. For

The Schr¨odinger equation for the quantum pendulum is given by
−
~

ψθθ − V0 cos θ ψ = Eψ . (4.137)
Introducing the change of variable θ = 2x and defining a = 8IE/~
2 and q = −4IV0/~
2
Eq. (4.137) becomes
ψxx + (a − 2q cos x)ψ = 0 . (4.138)
Equation (4.138) is identified as angular Mathieu equation. Since θ = 2x the boundary
condition is ψ(2x) = ψ(2(x + π)). The eigenfunction has to be periodic in x with period π.
Because of the intrinsic parity of the potential, there are two types of solutions. Even
solutions cer(x, q) (cosine-elliptic) for r = 0, 2, 4, . . . and odd solutions, ser(x, q) (sine￾elliptic) for r =1, 3, . . . [4]. cer and ser are expanded in terms of Fourier series. They are
given below [20]:

k=0
B2k+1(q) sin(2k + 1)x , (4.139d)
where m = 0, 1, 2, . . .. The recurrence relations between the coefficients are found by sub￾stituting the above series in Eq. (4.138). For example, for ce2m the recurrence relations are
[20]
aA0 = qA2 , (a − 4)A2 = q (2A0 + A4) , (4.140a)

A2k = q (A2k−2 + A2k+2) , (4.140b)
where k ≥ 2. When q = 0 the solutions (after normalization) are
ce0 = 1/
√
2, cer = cos rx, r ≥ 1, ser = sin rx, r ≥ 1. (4.141)
For fixed values of q, periodic solutions with period π or 2π exist only for specific values
(characteristic values) of a and are denoted by ar for the even solutions. For odd solutions
the characteristic values are, say, br. Mathematical packages, such as Mathematica, are
useful to evaluate the values of a and b. It is quite difficult to compute Mathieu functions.
For discussion on computation of Mathieu functions one may refer to refs. [21–23].
Figure 4.9 shows the plot of first few eigenvalues (a) as a function of q [18]. The eigenval￾ues are doubly-degenerate when q = 0 and partially small values of q. Observe the similarity
of the probability density functions of the first three energy levels [18] shown in Fig. 4.9
with the harmonic oscillator.Criteria for the Existence of a Bound State 105

4.10 Criteria for the Existence of a Bound State
Is it possible to know whether a given potential admits at least one bound state? The an￾swer is not positive for arbitrary potential. However, for certain potentials the conditions
for existence of a bound state have been obtained [24]. In this section, we consider the
one-dimensional potential not vanishing identically but vanishing everywhere outside some
interval:
V (x) = 0 and 6 V (x) = 0 for |x| > a . (4.142)
For this type of potential the conditions for the existence of a bound state are obtained [24].

Let us choose the normalizable trial eigenfunction as
ψ(x) = P(x) + λV (x), (4.146106 Exactly Solvable Systems I: Bound States
where λ is a real parameter, −∞ < λ < ∞, and P(x) is the Pyramid function

1 − (|x| − a)/L, if a < |x| ≤ L + a
0, if L + a < |x| < ∞ .
(4.147)
ψ given by Eq. (4.146) is normalizable for L > 0. Substituting Eq. (4.146) in Eq. (4.145)
we obtain
DhHi = Aλ2 + Bλ + C +

and V
′ = dV /dx. Since A, B and C are independent of L, for large L, the condition (4.148a)
is written as
DhHi = Aλ2 + Bλ + C < 0 . (4.149)
Therefore, a bound state must exist if the above condition is satisfied for some values of λ.
From Eqs. (4.148) and (4.149) we infer the following:
1. When λ = 0, ψ becomes P(x) and the sufficiency condition is [25,26]
Z ∞
−∞
V (x) dx < 0 . (4.150)
2. If A ≤ 0, then Eq. (4.149) is satisfied for some λ of sufficiently large magnitude.
3. If A > 0 then Eq. (4.149) is satisfied if C < B2/(4A).
Combining the above results, the Hamiltonian H will have a bound state if one of the
following conditions is realized:
(1) Z ∞

(3) Z ∞

V dx ≤ 0 . (4.151c)
The third condition is due to the fact that either (4.151a) is true or the right-side of (4.151b)
is positive. Further, it includes the case of equality. Thus, for any one-dimensional potential,
V (x) = 0, which vanishes outside some interval, the system must have at least one bound 6
state if R ∞
−∞ V (x) dx = 0, (the potential is zero on the average). The condition (4.151c) is
weaker.
It has been pointed out that a weak attractive potential in two-dimensions can generate
a bound state [27]. The problem of the existence of bound states in one- and two-dimensions
for N-particle systems has also been examined [28]. The mathematical and physical prop￾erties for the occurrence and nonoccurrence of bound states in a square-well potential have
been discussed [29Time-Dependent Harmonic Oscillator 107

change of shape.
4.12 Damped and Forced Linear Harmonic Oscillator
To study nonconservative and damped systems we need to introduce time-dependent Hamil￾tonian describing damped oscillations. Analysis of damped oscillators, particularly, linearly
damped harmonic oscillators, started from 1931 [30]. Since then a great deal of interest has
been paid to damped quantum mechanical systems [31–39].
Consider the classical Hamiltonian of a particle of mass m in one-dimension as
H(x, p, t) = 1
2m
e
−dtp
2 +

mω2

2 − mf(t)edtx, (4.163)
where d > 0 and ω

0 > 0 are constant parameters and f(t) is a function of time. The classical
equation of motion is
x˙ =
1
m
e
−dtp, p˙ = −ω
2
0me
dtx + mf(t)edt
. (4.164)
Equation (4.164) can be rewritten as
x¨ + dx˙ + ω
2
0x = f(t). (4.165)Damped and Forced Linear Harmonic Oscillator 109
Equation (4.165) is the classical damped and forced LHO. We can obtain useful information
of the unforced system by identifying its equilibrium point and its stability [40]. For d 6= 0
and f(t) = 0 the system (4.165) has only one equilibrium point and is (x
∗
, x˙
∗
) = (0, 0).
This equilibirum point is always stable. The trajectories started in the neighbourhood of
this equilibrium point approach it in the limit of t → ∞. However, the nature of trajectories
near the equilibrium point depends on the sign of the quantity d
2 − 4ω
2
0
.
In the under-damped case (d
2 − 4ω
2
0 < 0), that is, 0 < d < 2ω0 the trajectories in the
(x−x˙) phase space wind around the equilibrium point a number of times before reaching it
asymptotically. The equilibrium point is called a stable focus. When d
2 − 4ω
2
0 > 0, that is,
d > 2ω0 (over-damped case) the trajectories in the phase space approach the equilibrium
along parabolic paths. Such an equilibrium point is termed as a stable node. For the choice
d = 2ω0 corresponding to the critically damping the trajectories approach the equilibirum
point along straight-line paths. This type of equilibrium point is called a stable focus.
Consequently, we have the following three case:
1. Under-damped system: d
2 − 4ω
2
0 < 0.
2. Over-damped system: d
2 − 4ω
2
0 > 0.
3. Critical-damped system: d
2 = 4ω
2
0
.
4.12.1 Solution of the Classical System
The solution of the system (4.165) for the above mentioned three cases can be obtained by
Green’s function approach [34]. For the under-damped case the solution of Eq. (4.165) is
x(t) = e−dt/2

iωt + C2e
−iωt
+ xp(t), (4.166a)
where ω
2 = −
d

and the particular solution xp, which is independent of initial con￾ditions is obtained from Green’s function approach as
xp(t) = Z t
t0
G(t, t′

The solution for the critical-damped system is

where
xp(t) = Z t

In all the three cases t0 is the initial time and C1 and C2 are to be determined from the
given initial conditions. Construction of xp for f(t) = cos Ωt is left as an exercise for readers.110 Exactly Solvable Systems I: Bound States
4.12.2 Eigenfunctions of Quantum System
Eigenspectra and wave functions for the quantum mechanical damped and forced LHO for
the under-damped, over-damped and critical-damped cases can be obtained separately. In
the following we consider the under-damped case [34]. For the other cases see the ref.[34].
For a classical Hamiltonian system if an invariant quantity (constant of motion) I(x, p, t)
other than the Hamiltonian exists then it can be determined. Further,
dI

=
∂I
∂t + {I, H} =

∂t +
∂I
∂x
∂H
∂p −
∂I
∂p
∂H
∂x = 0. (4.169)
One can assume I = a(t)x + b(t)p + c(t) and using Eq. (4.169) the quantities a, b and c can
be determined. The above I is linear in x and p. We can also assume that I is quadrative
in x and p.
For a quantum mechanical system a quantum invariant operator satisfies the Eq. (7.12).
The eigenvalue equation for an I is
I(x, p, t)φ(x, t) = λφ(x, t). (4.170)
The general solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation of a system with H(x, p, t) for discrete
eigenvalues are related to φn as
ψ(x, t) = X
n
cne
γn(t)φn(x, t), (4.171)
where cn and γn(t) are to be determined. There are innumerable number of I satisfying
Eq. (4.170).
The quadratic invariant operator obtained for the quantum mechanical damped and
forced LHO for the under-damped case is [33,34]

4.13 Two-Dimensional Systems
Having studied certain one-dimensional quantum systems, next, we take up two-dimensional
systems. One novel feature of multi-dimensional systems is the realization of degeneracy in
energy levels. That is, different eigenfunctions correspond to same energy eigenvalue. The
source of degeneracy is an existence of symmetry in the potential.
We study the quantum mechanics of LHO and a particle in a box in two-dimension
Cartesian coordinates. Also, we treat the LHO in two-dimension polar coordinates.

higher energy levels are also degenerate. nth excited level is (n + 1)-fold degenerate.

The finiteness of the wave function requires terminating series, that is, an+1 = 0 for some
integer value of n. This gives

In terms of n and m the choice n = 0, m = 0 corresponds to ground state. The ground state
energy is E0,0 = ~ω. When n1 = 0, n2 = 1 we have E0,1 = 2~ω. In this case (n, m) = (0, ±1).
Therefore, the first excited state is doubly degenerate. The second excited state is three-fold
degenerate.

The solutions of Eqs. (4.210) are

Then
ψ(x, y) = (Ax sin kxx + Bx cos kxx) (Ay sin kyy + By cos kyy). (4.212)
This ψ should satisfy the boundary conditions given by Eq. (4.208). Applying these bound￾ary conditions we obtain
Ax sin kxa + Bx cos kxa = 0, −Ax sin kxa + Bx cos kxa = 0, (4.213)
Ay sin kyb + By cos kyb = 0, −Ay sin kyb + By cos kyb = 0. (4.214)

(nx = 1, 3, . . .) Ax = 0 while Bx is arbitrary. For even integer values of nx (2, 4, . . .) Bx = 0
while Ax is arbitrary. Similarly, for ny = 1, 3, . . . we have Ay = 0 while By is arbitrary and
for ny = 2, 4, . . . Ay is arbitrary and By = 0. Therefore, we have the following four cases:
Case 1:

4.14 Rigid Rotator
In this section, we focus on an interesting three-dimensional system. Consider two particles
of masses m1 and m2 joined about an axis passing through a point O. The particle of mass
m1 is at a distance r1 from O and the other particle is at a distance r2 from O and r1+r2 = R
(Fig. 4.12). Such a system is called a rigid rotator because the distances r1 and r2 are fixed.
The magnitude of the vibration of a diatomic molecule is generally small compared with
the equilibrium bond length so the rigid rotator is a good first approximation.

Let us denote the coordinates of the two particles with respect to the origin O as (x1, y1, z1)
and (x2, y2, z2), respectively. The classical equation of motion for the rigid rotator is

is the moment of inertia. The potential of the system is zero because
there is no external force on the system and hence H = Iω2/2.
The system is spherically symmetric. Therefore, it is convenient to deal it in spherical
polar coordinates. In this coordinates system the coordinates of the particles are (a, θ, φ)
and (b, π − θ, π + φ), respectively. We have
x1 = a sin θ cos φ, x2 = b sin θ cos φ, y1 = a sin θ sin φ, (4.218a)

The distance between successive energy levels increases with an increase in l. For l = 0 only
one value of m is possible: m = 0. For other values of l there are (2l + 1) allowed values
of m: −l, −l + 1, . . . , 0, . . . , l − 1, l. Therefore, each energy level is (2l + 1)-fold degenerate.
It can be shown that the allowed transitions between rotational states obey △l = ±1 and
△m = 0, ±1.

4.15 Concluding Remarks
Apart from the potentials considered in this chapter many other physically interesting
potential problems have also been solved exactly. Solving some of them are given as exercises
in the problem section. For example, a particle in a symmetric linear potential and the case
of a constant acceleration in one-dimension with V (x) = F x, F > 0 are solvable exactly
and the solutions of the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation are expressed in terms of Airy
function [1]. Another interesting potential is given by V (x) = ∞ for x < 0 and mgx for
x > 0 and is equivalent to a bouncing ball. The solutions to this problem are the odd states
of the linear potential [1,42]. Particle in a box with a delta-function potential [43] and in the
presence of a static electric field [44] are solved exactly. The quantum states for a particle in
the potential V (x) = −α/ǫ2
if 0 < x < ǫ and −α/x2
if ǫ < x < ∞ [45], V (x) = 1
2
kx2 +β/x2
[46] and in the asymmetric Manning–Rosen Type potential [47] are obtained122 Exactly Solvable Systems I: Bound States
Ladder operators for P¨oschl–Teller potentials [48] have been constructed. The stationary
one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation with a real polynomial potential V (q) of degree > 2
on the real axis is studied [49,50]. There exists a class of potentials called quasi-exactly
solvable [51–53] which depends on a parameter J. For these systems it is possible to find J
number of eigenstates.
P
A method of constructing analytical solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation for V (x) =
m Vmf
m, where Vm are constants and f(x) is a function satisfying certain conditions
are proposed [54]. The dynamical group structure of the one-dimensional quantum system
with the infinitely deep square-well potential and its creation and annihilation operators
are studied [55]. The influence of distant boundaries on quantum mechanical energy levels
is also investigated. For a simple and explicit formula for the ground state energy change
with application to LHO and hydrogen atom the readers may refer the ref. [56]. There
exists some potentials tending to zero at infinity and yet possessing eigenfunctions with
positive energy. For details about such potentials and a method to construct them see for
example ref. [1]. There has been a considerable interest in recent years in obtaining exact
and quasi-exact solutions of the position-dependent mass Schr¨odinger equation for various
potentials and mass functions by using various methods [57]. A Green’s function procedure
to construct ground state and excited state solutions has been illustrated in refs. [58,59]. A
variational method has been developed for obtaining energy eigenvalues of N-dimensional
nonpolynomial potential systems [60]. In ref. [61] an approximate formulas for bound state
energy eigenvalues of particle in a box potential and finite square-well potential are obtained
without solving the Schr¨odinger equation.
The connection between the quantized energy eigenvalue spectrum of a bound state and
the classical motions of the corresponding classical system has become increasingly interest￾ing as the ability to experimentally probe the quantum-classical interface has dramatically
improved. Methods such as periodic orbit theory [62,63] are very useful to explore this. Can
degenerate bound states occur in one-dimensional quantum systems? It has been pointed
out that bound states with degeneracy in energy but differing in parity can occur even if
the potential is nonsingular in an finite domain [64].

5.1 Introduction
In the previous chapter, we focused our discussion on certain exactly solvable quantum
mechanical systems possessing bound states. In the present chapter, we wish to concentrate
on some fascinating and interesting one-dimensional systems, where the quantum states
are essentially scattering states. For scattering states energy eigenvalues are continuous and
energy eigenfunctions are nonnormalizable. An interesting feature of many scattering po￾tentials is the occurrence of tunnelling. It is the most striking qualitative difference between
classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. In tunnelling a quantum mechanical particle
passes through a region where the potential energy exceeds the total energy of the particle.
This phenomenon is impossible in classical mechanics. Classically, a particle is completely
reflected from a barrier. Quantum tunnelling has many technological applications.
In the present chapter, we consider the following potentials and discuss the features of
scattering states of them:
1. Barrier potential.
2. Square-well potential.
3. Step potential.
4. Locally periodic potentials.
5. Reflectionless potentials – sech2
potentials.
We will construct the reflected and transmitted waves for the above potentials subjected to
appropriate boundary conditions. We obtain the expressions for reflection and transmission
amplitudes and analyze their dependence on the energy of the incident particle and the
parameters of the potentials. The square-well and sech2
potentials admit bound states also.
We construct the bound state eigenfunctions and the energy eigenvalues for these potentials.
Finally, we point out a new kind of tunnelling called dynamical tunnelling which refers to
a motion allowed by quantum mechanics but forbidden by classical mechanics.
5.2 Potential Barrier: Tunnel Effect
As a first intriguing example of a scattering system, we consider a particle in the presence
of a square-barrier potential (Fig. 5.1)
V (x) = (
V0, for |x| < a
0, for |x| > a .

FIGURE 5.1
One-dimensional barrier potential.
5.2.1 Classical Solution
A classical particle moving towards the barrier will be completely reflected from it if E < V0.
For the particle in region R1 moving towards the barrier from a position x0 with velocity
v, the position x(t) is given by
x(t) = (
x0 + vt, 0 < t < t1 = (|x0| − a)/v
−a − |v|(t − t1), t > t1 .
(5.2)
Similar solution can also be written for the region R3. The motion of the particle in the
regions R1 and R3 is not confined to a finite region of space. It does not exhibit periodic
oscillation. The motion is classically forbidden in the barrier region |x| < a. The problem
thus turns out to be scattering of the particle by the potential barrier.
5.2.2 Solution of the Wave Equation for E < V0
The Schr¨odinger equations in the regions R1, R2 and R3 are given by
ψ1xx + k
2
0ψ1 = 0 , x < −a (5.3a)
ψ2xx − k
2ψ2 = 0 , |x| < a (5.3b)

0ψ3 = 0 , x > a (5.3c)
where k
2
0 = 2mE/~
2
, k
2 = 2m(V0 − E)/~
2
. We treat the quantum cases with E < V0 and
E > V0 separately.
The solutions of Eqs. (5.3) are
ψ(x) =



ψ1 = Ae
ik0x + Be
−ik0x
ψ2 = Fe
−kx + Ge
kx
ψ3 = Ce
ik0x + De
−ik0x
.
(5.4)
The functions eik0x and e−ik0x
in ψ1 represent waves moving towards the barrier (from
x < −a) and moving away from the barrier (towards x = −∞), respectively. They are
the incident and reflected waves. In the region R3, the functions eik0x and e−ik0x are the
waves travelling away from the barrier towards x = ∞ and moving towards the barrier. ThePotential Barrier: Tunnel Effect 131
unknowns in Eqs. (5.4) are determined by applying the appropriate boundary conditions.
Note that the wave functions given by Eqs. (5.4) are nonnormalizable.
The boundary conditions are set by requiring that ψ’s and their first derivative are
continuous at x = a and −a. The boundary conditions are
at x = −a : ψ1 = ψ2 and ψ1x = ψ2x , (5.5a)
at x = a : ψ2 = ψ3 and ψ2x = ψ3x . (5.5b)
These boundary conditions give four linear simultaneous equations for the six unknowns A,
B, C, D, F and G. We need to fix the values of two unknowns. For a particle incident from
left D = 0. As A represents the amplitude of the incident wave we can freely set the value
of it in an experiment. Therefore, the value of A is treated as known. Then there are four
equations for the four unknowns B, C, F and G.

If Jinc, Jref and Jtra represent incident, reflected and transmitted currents, respectively,
then the reflected and transmitted coefficients are R = Jref/Jinc and T = Jtra/Jinc, where

Since the total probability must be 1 we require that T + R = 1. This can be easily verified

For E > V0, k

2 < 0 while for E < V0, k

E > V0 can be obtained from the results of E < V0 by replacing k by ik, sinh2ka by isin2ka.

For a particle with energy E > V0, Eq. (5.12c) predicts complete transmission when
sin2
2ka = 0. In this case, Tmax = 1 and 2ka = nπ, n = 1, 2, . . .. Such resonances in
transmission correspond to the situation in which the scattered waves originating from
x = −a and x = a interfere and exactly cancel any reflection from the potential barrier.
5.2.4 Quantum Tunnelling
A classical particle would be reflected from the barrier for E < V0. In contrast, in quantum
theory there is a finite transmission probability. That is, if a microscopic particle is incident
on the barrier with energy relatively lower than the height of the potential barrier then it will
not necessarily be reflected by the barrier. But there is always a finite nonzero probability
for the particle to cross the barrier and continue its motion in the classically forbidden
region R3. This phenomenon of crossing the barrier is called tunnel effect. (When a metal
surface is subjected to a large electric field the potential at the surface changes and some of
the free electrons in the metal tunnel through the resulting barrier and are emitted. This is
known as field emission.)
The tunnelling effect is one of the phenomena for which the difference between classical
and quantum physics is most striking. It describes the propagation of a particle in a clas￾sically forbidden domain. (What are the kinetic energy and the velocity of the particle in
this zone?) Without tunnelling, tunnel diode would not exist. The probability of tunnelling
depends in general on (i) the energy E of the particle, (ii) the height V0 of the barrier and
(iii) the width 2a of the barrier.
Figure 5.2 illustrates the Re ψ for a few values of E, where V0 = 1 and a = 6. The
behaviour of Re ψ inside the barrier is not always an exponential decay. For E = 0.6, Re ψ
exhibits exponential decay with x; for E = 0.9 it displays a power-law type variation; for
E = 1.0001 (that is ≈ V0) it varies linearly; for E = 1.1 and 2 it shows oscillation.
Figure 5.3 shows T versus E/V0 for two fixed values of V0a
2
. For E < V0 (E/V0 < 1),
T increases with increase in E. For E > V0, an interesting feature is that T (as well as
R) varies in an oscillatory fashion. It shows a series of resonances peaked at specific E/V0
values where T = 1, the maximum allowed value. The resonances come from the multiple
scattering effects within the barrier. (What will happen if we consider a double-barrier or
a finite number of square-barrier? For some details see sec. 5.5.) For 2ka ≫ 1 Eq. (5.11a)
becomes
T ≈

The exponential factor comes from the exponential decay of the wave function from the
incident side to the transmitted side a distance 2a away. The factors in front of the ex￾ponential term come from the matching conditions. T decreases exponentially with a anPotential Barrier: Tunnel Effect 133

quantum tunnelling is extremely sensitive to small changes in a. This dependence of T on
a has been experimentally confirmed in the phenomenon of vacuum tunnelling [2].
We wish to know whether the oscillatory behaviour of T is peculiar to the rectangular
shape or characteristic of other potential barriers also. Oscillatory behaviour of T and R
has been observed in the truncated Gaussian potential [3]

where V0, β and a are constant parameters. When the width of the potential barrier is
increased the magnitude of oscillations in T for E < V0 is found to decrease. The results of
the potentials given by Eqs. (5.1), (5.14) and (5.15) suggest that the discontinuous change
in the potential and its slope essentially determine the relatively large variations in T that
occur for E > V0. We expect from these results that the smaller the abrupt change in a
potential barrier, the smaller will be the variations in T for E > V0.

5.2.5 Physical Systems Modelled by the Square-Barrier Potential
In 1838 Heinrich Friedrich Emil Lenz observed the freezing of water into ice on a bismuth￾antimony junction when an electric current passed through the junction in one direction.
When the direction of the current was reversed the melting of the ice into water was found.
Consequently, a thermo-electric power generator works as a refrigerator. The fundamental
quantum process of an electron moving across a potential barrier plays the vital role in
thermionic power generation and refrigeration.
Consider two parallel metal electrodes with a vacuum gap between them acting as a bar￾rier. The charge accumulation only affects the magnitude of the thermionic current. Because
of the nature of the quantum transmission probability and the temperature behaviour of
the Fermi distribution under certain conditions the thermionic current reverses its direction.
This effect occurs in a system of two identical metallic conducting wires separated by a layer
of insulating material [4]. There is no bias applied across the wires. The wires are connected
to two thermal reservoirs kept at a higher temperature Th and a lower temperature Tc.
The difference in chemical potentials µh and µc is due to the different temperatures. Such
a system can be realized with the semiconductor hetero-structures fabrication technology.
The barrier potential is also useful to model metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) and field￾effect-transistors (FETs). A barrier can arise if a metal is heated to give rise to thermionic
emission. Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim and Ralph Howard Fowler (1920s) realized that the
barrier penetration could be used to understand the emission of electrons from a metal in
a strong electric field.
5.2.6 Importance of Quantum Tunnelling
There are many phenomena in physics where tunnelling plays a central role. Five Nobel
Prizes in physics were awarded for research concerned with tunnelling in semiconductor and
for the invention of scanning tunnelling microscopy. Tunnelling is crucial for nucleo-synthesis
in stars and in the evolution of early universe. Molecular spectra, electron emission from
metals, cold emission of electrons from metals, current-voltage characteristics of transistors,
magnetization in certain metals, microwave absorption of ammonia and alpha decay are
explained through the tunnelling phenomenon. Some of the examples and applications of
tunnelling are given below:
1. In tunnel diodes, the tunnelling effect is a source for a region in the current￾voltage characteristic where the differential resistance is negative. α-decay occurs
due to the tunnel effect.
2. In 1973, Brain David Josephson was awarded the Nobel Prize together with Leo
Esaki and Ivar Giaever for an invention of a junction called Josephson junction.
In a Josephson junction transition regions between two superconducting materials
are separated by a thin insulating layer. In these devices pairs of electrons known
as cooper pairs tunnel from one superconducting region to another through thin
insulating layer. This effect gives rise to currents flowing without an applied
voltage.
3. A scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) working by quantum tunnelling between
the surface of an electrical conductor and a fine conducting probe was invented
by Gerd Binning and Heinrich Rohrer. They received the Nobel Prize in 1986 for
this invention. In a STM a thin needle moves across the surface of a sample. If
the needle and the sample are close to each other then electrons can tunnel from
the needle to the sample. In this way the picture of the surface of the sample is
obtained.Finite Square-Well Potential 137
4. Friedrich Hund (1927) was the first to use the quantum mechanical barrier pene￾tration in the theory of molecular spectra. Internal structure of complex molecules
and the rotationally induced dissociation of a diatomic molecule from an excited
state can be studied by the tunnelling phenomenon.
5. A series of nuclear reactions in the sun produces light energy. In this scenario,
two protons come very close and form a bound consisting of a proton, a neutron,
a positron and a neutrino. First, two protons come closer. Since they have same
electric charge they repel each other. According to classical mechanics this re￾action would take place very slowly and no light would come out from the sun.
But quantum mechanics predicts that one proton tunnels through the barrier of
repulsion separating the two protons and allows the reaction to continue [5].
5.3 Finite Square-Well Potential
Consider a potential which is zero within a certain interval and V0 elsewhere. Such a po￾tential is called a square-well potential and is represented as
V (x) = (
0, for |x| < a
V0, for |x| > a.
(5.23)
The potential is schematically represented in Fig. 5.4. An interesting remarkable feature of
this potential is that it admits both bound and scattering states. Further, the bound states
of the square-well potential are finite in number .
5.3.1 Physical Systems
Certain materials crystallize in an almost similar manner and possess exactly the same
lattice constants. Therefore, they may be grown together as a single crystal. A junction
in a single crystal between two materials whose lattices match but are otherwise different
is known as heterojunction. In a double heterojunctions, two junctions are used in order
to sandwich a layer of a narrow band gap material between wide band gap materials. In
this way, two heterostructure interfaces form a quantum well. Such double-heterostructures

are very common for light-emitting diodes and lasers used for optical communication. This
potential is used to model emission of electrons in metals and for short-range forces.
5.3.2 Solution of the Wave Equation for E < V0
For a classical particle with kinetic energy less than the potential energy, its motion is
bounded within the region R1. Its dynamics are similar to that of infinite height potential
discussed in the sec. 4.6. The particle in R1 cannot enter into the region R2 or R3. When
the kinetic energy is greater than the potential energy the particle is able to overcome the
potential barrier and enter into the region R2 or R3. Then the motion is not bounded.
Now, we focus on quantum dynamics of the particle. The Schr¨odinger equation for
|x| < a and |x| > a are given by
ψxx + k
2ψ = 0 , |x| < a (5.24a)

is positive for 0 < E < V0 and negative for E > V0. The nature of the solution of
Eq. (5.24b) is different for α
2 < 0 and α
2 > 0. Therefore, these two cases must be studied
separately.
5.3.2.1 Bound States: 0 < E < V0, α
2 > 0
The solution of Eq. (5.24a) (for the region R1) is
ψ1 = A sin kx + B cos kx , |x| < a . (5.25a)
The solution of Eq. (5.24b) for the regions R2 and R3 is ψ = Ce
−αx + De
αx. In the region
R2 when x < −a, as x → −∞ the first term in the above solution tends to ∞. To avoid
this, set C = 0 so that
ψ2 = De
αx , x < −a . (5.25b)
In the region R3 as x → ∞ the second term in ψ tends to ∞. Therefore, we choose D = 0.
Now, the solution is
ψ3 = Ce
−αx , x > a . (5.25c)
The solutions ψ1, ψ2 and ψ3 must satisfy certain appropriate boundary conditions.
5.3.2.2 Boundary Conditions
The boundary conditions arise due to the continuity of the solutions and their derivatives
at x = ±a. Matching the solutions (5.25) and their derivatives at x = ±a give a system of
four equations for the four unknowns A, B, C and D. The compatibility condition for these
equations leads to an equation for the energy En.
The boundary conditions are
at x = a, ψ1 = ψ3, ψ1x = ψ3x, (5.26a)
at x = −a, ψ1 = ψ2, ψ1x = ψ2x. (5.26b)
These conditions lead to the following set of equations:

2B cos ka = (C + D)e−αa
, (5.28a)
2Bk sin ka = α(C + D)e−αa
. (5.28b)

Equation (5.29) is satisfied if the following two conditions are satisfied:
(i) B = 0, k is arbitrary.
(ii) B 6= 0, tan ka = α/k.
Next, subtracting Eq. (5.27c) from Eq. (5.27a) and Eq. (5.27d) from Eq. (5.27b) we
obtain
2A sin ka = (C − D)e−αa
, (5.30a)
2Ak cos ka = −α(C − D)e−αa
. (5.30b)

α
+ tan ka
= 0 (5.31)
which implies either
(iii) A = 0, k is arbitrary or
(iv) A 6= 0, tan ka = −k/α.
Because k
2 = 2mE/~
2
, arbitrariness of k means E is arbitrary. From the results (i)-(iv)
note that E is arbitrary only if A = B = 0. In this case the wave function ψ1 is zero which
we do not want. For both A 6= 0, B 6= 0 the condition is

For real ka this is not possible and hence the conditions (iii) and (iv) are not satisfied
simultaneously. The news is, A 6= 0, B 6= 0 is not possible. Therefore, either A = 0 or
B = 0. Now, we have the following two cases:
Case 1: A = 0, B 6= 0, tan ka = α/k.
Case 2: A 6= 0, B = 0, tan ka = −k/α.
Since k is not arbitrary, E is not arbitrary and it can take only specific sets of values. This
leads to discreteness of energy levels. For the cases 1 and 2 we

The constants A and B are to be determined by the normalization condition.
Next, we determine the eigenfunctions for specific values of V0 and a. Let us fix V0 = 35,
a = 1 and ~
2 = m = 1. Using the Newton–Raphson method the roots of Eq. (5.35b)
are found to be k = 1.4024, 1.7859, 4.1881, 5.4166 and 6.8870. Among these 5 values, the
values of k satisfying the condition (5.35a) are k0 = 1.4024, k2 = 4.1881 and k4 = 6.8870.
The notable result is that there are only three discrete energy levels for the case 1. The
corresponding unnormalized eigenfunctions are depicted in Fig. 5.5. For the case 2 we obtain
k1 = 2.8003, k3 = 5.5568 and k5 = 8.1048. In this case also there are only three discrete
energy levels. The unnormalized eigenfunctions of the discrete energy levels are shown in

2 = m = 1. The eigenfunctions are unnormalized (A = 1 in Eq. (5.39)).
The energy difference between V0 and the top-most bound state energy is called the
work function φ0. An electron bound in a metal would be dislodged only if the incident
photon energy exceeds φ0. The φ0 of the metals Ni, Ta, Cd and Ag are 4.2, 4.5, 4.6 and
4.8eV, respectively.
In the regions R2 and R3, the total energy E is less than V0. Classically, a particle in
R1 cannot enter the regions R2 and R3. When it reaches x = ±a, it turns back and hence
the motion is confined within |x| < a. In contrast to this, in quantum mechanics |ψ2|
2 and
|ψ3|
2 are nonzero in R2 and R3 and hence the probability for the presence of particle in the
classically forbidden regions is finite and nonzero.
Let us summarize the significant features of the square-well potential.
1. The potential admits only a few discrete energy eigenvalues and normalizable
eigenfunctions. All the allowed discrete energy values are less than the depth of
the well.
2. The number of discrete states increases with increase in the depth of the well.
However, since α increases with increase in V0, the extent of the tail of the eigen￾functions in the classically forbidden region decreases (refer to Eq. (5.39)).
3. From Eq. (5.39) it is clear that the eigenfunctions are oscillatory in the classi￾cally allowed region (−a < x < a) and exponentially decaying in the classically
forbidden regions (|x| > a).
4. From Figs. 5.5 and 5.6 we note that ψn has n nodes.
5. As a consequence of the symmetry in V , V (x) = V (−x), the eigenfunctions have
alternating even (Eq. (5.38)) and odd (Eq. (5.39)) parity.142 Exactly Solvable Systems II: Scattering States
Solved Problem 3:
Determine the expression for the transmission probability T for the case of E > V0 with
the particle moing from left to right in the presence of the finite square-well potential.
For E > V0 defining α

For E > V0 the wave function in the interval x ∈ [−∞, ∞] is nonnormalizable and the

boundary conditions at x = −a and x = a give

of square-barrier potential the set of Eqs. (5.42) can be solved by the Gauss elimination
method.

Figure 5.7 shows the plot of variation of T with E/V0. As E increases from V0 the value of ǫ
decreases and for sufficiently large E/V0 the value of T ≈ 1. Similar to the barrier potential
a series of resonances occur.
5.4 Potential Step
As an example of another interesting scattering state system we consider the problem of
a homogeneous beam of free particles moving along a straight-line crossing one region to
another of a different potential. The two regions are separated by a plane surface. Suppose
the potential of the above system is of the form
V (x) = (
0, x < 0
V0, x > 0
(5.45)
which is depicted in Fig. 5.8. The potential is zero for x < 0 and V0 for x > 0. The potential
given by Eq. (5.45) is called a single-step potential barrier.Potential Step 143

5.4.1 Physical Systems with Step Potential
Heterojunctions are commonly grown with semiconductors, which may be undoped or doped
n or p type. Consider two conductors A and B with conduction and valence band edges
Ec and Ev, respectively, and with different magnitudes of forbidden gap. An electron at
conduction band edge in A will have lower energy than in material B. When junction is
made between A and B, a potential barrier is developed at the interface with region x < 0
and x > 0 representing the materials A and B, respectively. This restricts the motion of
electrons incident from the A (left) side. This type of situation is realized in GaAs and
AlxGa1−xAs junctions. The electron in the GaAs encounters a barrier to enter in AlGaAs
part of the structure. It is reflected back by the potential.
5.4.2 Particle Energy Above the Potential Step: E > V0
Let us first mention the dynamics of the classical particle. The total energy is greater than
the potential energy. Further, the kinetic energy is positive. Therefore, a classical particle144 Exactly Solvable Systems II: Scattering States
moving towards x = 0 from x < 0 will not be reflected at x = 0. In the quantum case, the
Schr¨odinger equation corresponding to the potential, Eq. (5.45), is

is negative for E < V0. We analyze these two
cases separately.
The solutions of the Eqs. (5.46) are

, x < 0 (5.47a)
ψ2 = Ce
ikx + De
−ikx , x > 0 (5.47b)
where A, B, C and D are constants to be determined. In Eq. (5.47a) eik0x
represents
the incident wave moving towards positive x-direction and e−ik0x
represents the reflected
wave moving towards negative x-direction. In Eq. (5.47b) eikx represents the transmitted
wave moving in positive x-direction and e−ikx represents the reflected wave moving towards
negative x-direction. Since discontinuity occurs only at x = 0 there is no reflected wave for
x > 0 and so D becomes zero. Further, we set the amplitude of the incident wave as unity.
We write the Eqs. (5.47) as
x < 0 : ψ1 = ψinc + ψref , (5.48a)
x > 0 : ψ2 = ψtra , (5.48b)
where ψinc = eik0x

Since V0 > 0 we have k < k0, or k/k0 < 1. As a result the probability of finding the
particle anywhere in the region x > 0 is greater than the probability of finding it anywhere
in the region x < 0. We account for this from the classical argument that the probability
of finding a particle is more in the region where its velocity is less. Since the velocity of the
particle in the region x > 0 is less than its velocity in x < 0, the probability is more in the
region x > 0. Figure 5.9 shows the reflection (R) and transmission (T ) probabilities as a
function of k/k0 for the step potential. Continuous and dashed curves represent R and T ,
respectively.Potential Step 145

5.4.3 Particle Energy Below the Potential Step: 0 < E < V0
Next, consider the case of the energy E of the particle is smaller than the height V0 of
the potential step. The classical particle in the left region will remain in the left region.
The particle moving towards the right will be completely reflected at x = 0. In classical
mechanics finding the particle in x > 0 is impossible because in this region the total energy
is less than the potential energy, so that the kinetic energy p
2
x/(2m) < 0 and the momentum
px is imaginary.
Defining k
2 = 2m(V0 − E)/~

, the Schr¨odinger equation takes the form

0ψ1 = 0 , x < 0 (5.51a)
ψ2xx − k

ψ1 = eik0x + Be
−ik0x
, x < 0 (5.52a)
ψ2 = Ce
kx + De
−kx , x > 0. (5.52b)
In the limit x → ∞, we have ekx → ∞, therefore, choose C = 0. The probability of finding
the particle in the region x > 0 decreases rapidly with x as e−2kx. But there is a finite
nonzero probability for finding the particle in the region x > 0. The penetration into the
classically forbidden region is a striking prediction of quantum mechanics. The penetrating
distance is ∆x = ~/(2p
2m(V0 − E)).
As done earlier for E > V0, we determine B and D using the boundary conditions at
x = 0. We obtain
B =
k0 − ik
k0 + ik
, D =
2k0

Further, R = |B|
2 = 1 while T = 0. Even though T is zero in the region x > 0, the wave
function is not zero!
For the linear harmonic oscillator and the particle in a box, the stationary state eigen￾functions are normalizable and the energy eigenvalues are discrete. The eigenfunctions for
the cases of the free particles, square-barrier and step potentials are nonnormalizable and
their energy eigenvalues are continuous.146 Exactly Solvable Systems II: Scattering States

it is oscillatory for x > 0. The eigenfunction does not fall abruptly to zero at x = 0 but
diminishes exponentially with x. The probability of finding the particle in x > 0 decreases
exponentially with increasing x.Locally Periodic Potential 147

From Eq. (5.53) we have T = 0 and R = 1.
5.5 Locally Periodic Potential
In this section, we consider scattering by a potential consisting of N-identical cells. The
potential is locally periodic, that is, it is periodic on a finite interval and zero elsewhere. It
has been shown that the N-cell transmission and reflection probabilities can be expressed
in terms of single cell probabilities [6]. The N-delta function and square-barrier potentials
exhibit band structure, a striking special character of transmission probability [6–9]. This
feature is observed even for quite small number of unit cell.
First, we define the transfer matrix M [6] associated with the scattering by a single cell.
Next, we show the determination of the transmission probability for multiple scattering
using M. Then we obtain a simple closed form expression for transmission probability for
arbitrary Dirac-delta and rectangular barrier cells.
5.5.1 M Matrix
Let us consider a locally periodic potential consisting of three regions:
Region−I −∞ < x < a : V = 0
Region−II a ≤ x ≤ b : V = V (x)
Region−III b < x < ∞ : V = 0 .

Suppose the basic unit cell is replicated N times at regular intervals. Then the goal is to
construct the matrix M for the full array making use of the given M of a single cell. For
simplicity, assume the potential of the unit cell as V = V (x) for −a < x < a and zero for
|x| > a. Now, we study the scattering from a Dirac comb [8].
Interestingly, the scattering of particles by a Dirac-delta potential V = V0δ(x − x0) is
exactly solvable. The M matrix for the single cell with x0 = 0 is obtained as (see the exercise

We need to find P
N . Using Cayley–Hamilton theorem [10,11] we find a formula for P
N .
The characteristic equation for P is det(P − IP) = 0, that is,
P
2 − PTr(P) + detP = P
2 − 2ξP + I = 0 , (5.68)
where ξ = Tr(P)/2 . According to the Cayley–Hamilton theorem any matrix satisfies its
own characteristic equation
P
2 − 2P ξ + I = 0 . (5.69)
The point is that any higher power of P can be reduced to a linear combination of P and
I:
P
N = P UN−1(ξ) − IUN−2(ξ), (5.70)
where UN (ξ) is a polynomial of degree N in ξ. We can easily find U’s. Multiplying Eq. (5.70)
by P and using Eq. (5.69) for P
2 we obtain
P
N+1 = (2P ξ − I)UN−1(ξ) − P UN−2(ξ). (5.71)
On the other hand, replacing N by N + 1 in Eq. (5.70) we get
P
N+1 = P UN (ξ) − IUN−1(ξ). (5.72)
Comparison of Eqs. (5.71) and (5.72) gives
UN+2(ξ) − 2ξUN+1(ξ) + UN (ξ) = 0 . (5.73)
Equation (5.73) is the recursion relation for Chebychev polynomials. For N = 2, Eq. (5.70)
becomes
P
2 = P U1(ξ) − IU0(ξ). (5.74)
Equating this expression with Eq. (5.69) we have U0 = 1 and U1 = 2ξ. Using these U2 can
be computed from Eq. (5.73). Similarly, other U’s can be computed. Now,

Transmission probability T versus N for two values of E.
Some of the special features of T versus E are summarized below:
1. For more than one barrier the graph of T has number of energy bands in which
T (N) ≈ 1.
2. The bands are separated by valleys where T (N) approaches zero for large N. They
can be regarded as the precursors of the band structure of periodic potentials.
The bands occur even for small numbers of barriers.
3. Each band contains N ripples.
4. As N increases the valleys become more and more narrow. The number of valleys
that are flatter and deeper increases with an increase in N.
5. For a fixed energy value, T changes significantly as the number of barriers is
increased. This is shown in Fig. 5.12 where T is plotted as a function of N for
E = 500 and 725.
For a detailed discussion on multiple rectangular barrier one may refer to ref. [8]. For
discussion on quantum mechanical tunnelling in neural networks refer to refs. [12,13].
5.6 Reflectionless Potentials
In this present chapter so far we studied scattering of particles by some simple potentials.
In the case of square-barrier oscillating T is observed. For very large E greater than V0
we have T ≈ 1. For the Dirac-delta function potential T is found to increase with E and
approach to the limiting value 1. Now, we ask an interesting question: Are there potentials
for which T = 1 for arbitrary energy? In other words, do we have a potential which perfectly
transmits incoming waves with any energy? The answer is yes. There are infinite number
of potentials with the above property. Such potentials are called reflectionless potentials
[14–17] and they can be constructed using inverse scattering transform [14].
A class of one-dimensional reflectionless potentials with their bound and scattering states
expressed in terms of elementary functions are the sech2
potentials, called modified P¨oschl–
Teller potentials, given by [15–17]

with the usual notation.

even in x. The even solution is obtained with A = 1, B = 0:

, where x

is a turning point. Since sech2

is an even function of x

we have E < 0. Therefore, E < 0 corresponds to bound states and E > 0 corresponds to
scattering states. We now consider the cases E < 0 and E > 0 separately.
Case 1: Bound States, E < 0
We write k = iǫ, ǫ > 0 so that El = −ǫ
2
. By performing an asymptotic analysis of (5.85),
we obtain the eigenvalues for even eigenstates from the relation ǫ = l − 2n, n = 0, 1, . . .. For
the odd states ǫ = l − 1 − 2n, n = 0, 1, . . .. Then the energy eigenvalues are given by
E
(n)
l = (l − n)
2
, n ≤ l (5.87)
where n = 0, 1, . . .. Since n ≤ l for a given l, there are only a finite number of bound states.
From Eq. (5.87) we note that El = 0 is an energy eigenvalue for any integer value of l.
Case 2: Scattering States
From the asymptotic form of ψo and ψe we infer the following. When E > 0, a and b
are complex conjugates and the general solution for |x| → ∞ is written as

where the constants Ce, Co, φe and φo are to be determined by making an asymptotic
analysis of the solutions at x → ±∞. The constants A˜ and B˜ are found to be arbitrary
while φo and φe are determined as [16]
φe = arg

φo = arg
Γ(ik)e−ik log 2
Γ[(l + ik)/2]Γ[(−l + ik)/2] . (5.88d)

where s = sinhπk/ sin πl. When l is an integer |s| = ∞ and hence |R|
2 = 0 and |T |
2 = 1.
That is, a particle incident on the potential is transmitted with unit probability. As a result
the potentials given by Eq. (5.81) are known as reflectionless potentials. The reflectionless
potential systems can also be studied by means of creation and annihilation operators [20].
5.7 Dynamical Tunnelling
The tunnelling phenomenon encountered in the study of potential barrier is a process per￾mitted by quantum theory but disallowed by classical mechanics on energy consideration.
A new kind of tunnelling called dynamical tunnelling was found. It refers to a behaviour al￾lowed by quantum mechanics but forbidden by classical mechanics. It involves no potential
barrier. However, a constant of motion (other than energy) forbids classically the quantum
allowed phenomenon. Dynamical tunnelling has been observed in
1. a periodically driven undamped pendulum,
2. ultracold atoms forming a Bose–Einstein condensate in an amplitude-modulated
optical standing wave and
3. a ball bouncing between two semicircular mirrors.
In the third example, it is easy to notice that classically the ball cannot escape from the
region between the mirrors. Even though escape is possible energetically, and potential
barrier would not prevent it, but still the classical motion of the ball disallows it to escape.
Here escape is prevented not by energy considerations. Note that escape is not ruled out
by the quantum formalism. The ball would be able to escape by dynamical tunnelling154 Exactly Solvable Systems II: Scattering States
slowly. Another example, is the formaldehyde molecule H2CO. In classical picture, oxygen
in H2CO molecule spinning around the C-O axis always points out in one direction. In
quantum mechanics it can oscillate between pointing up and down without violating the
conservation of energy or angular momentum. For details on dynamical tunnelling see refs.
[21–28].
5.8 Concluding Remarks
In the systems we studied in this chapter, the bound states and continuum states, (scattering
states) are well separated in energy. However, there are quantum systems with bound states
embedded in continuum (BSECs) [29–35]. Such states are regarded as exotic quantum states
and they do not have classical analogues. BSECs have been observed experimentally [30].
Scattering by a double square-well potential [36], double delta-function potential [37, 38], a
Coulomb field in two-dimensions [39], asymmetrical potential [40], a finite periodic potential
[41], double-barrier potential [42], perturbed finite square-well potential [43], Hermitian and
non-Hermitian potentials [44] and two-dimensional potentials [45] have also been analyzed.
Quantum mechanical transmission probability has been computer for periodic, quasiperiodic
and random finite lattices [46], rectangular double-barrier potential and parabolic double￾barrier potential [47].
There are number of modern opto-electronic devices involving low-dimensional hetero￾structure. The unbound states of semiconductor quantum wells and quantum dots play
significant role in their optical properties. Quantum mechanical transmission and reflec￾tion of electrons at potential energy steps can be applied to the design of nonequilibrium
transistors.

Matrix Mechanics
6.1 Introduction
The quantum theoretical description of microscopic systems discussed so far is based on
differential operators and the solution of the underlying eigenvalue equations. This approach
is called Schro¨dinger approach or wave mechanics. Heisenberg developed another equivalent
approach called matrix mechanics. Because the trajectory of an electron is unobservable
and moreover line spectra implied discrete allowed states, Heisenberg discarded the idea
of electron orbits and formulated a theory for line spectra of excited systems based on
observables. When Heisenberg arranged the allowed set of transitions in a matrix form, to
his surprise, each element of the matrix was found to be related to the probability of a
particular transition. This gave the birth to matrix mechanics. Then Heisenberg, Born and
Jordan worked out the rules of these matrices.
In the Heisenberg formulation, the wave function ψ becomes a vector while the oper￾ators are represented by matrices [1,2]. The transformations from one vector into another
is described by matrices. It is thus possible to represent the operators as matrices. The
differential equations of the Schr¨odinger’s wave mechanics became matrix equations. For
example, consider the differential equation Aφ = φ
′
, where φ and φ
′ are two functions and
A is a linear differential operator. In matrix method the functions φ and φ
′ are column (or
row) vectors and A is a square matrix. The wave mechanical approach and matrix approach,
although mathematically different, they are found to give equivalent solutions to the same
problems1
[3,4].
In matrix mechanics all observables are represented by matrices. All possible eigenvalues
of a matrix representing an observable are the possible outcomes of experimental measure￾ment on that observable. Since observables take only real values and because the eigenvalues
of Hermitian matrices are real they are the most suitable matrices to represent observables.
More precisely, in matrix mechanics the properties of the matrices are of interest and not
the space on which these matrices operate. In contrast to this, in wave mechanics we study
the properties of the elements of this space.
In this chapter first we give the preliminary concepts relative to the use of the matrix
method. Next, we present the various elements of matrix mechanics. Then we discuss the
matrix representation of operators of certain systems. We introduce Dirac’s notation of state
vectors, Hilbert space, projection operator, displacement operators and the generators of
translations.
1D.F. Styer described the equivalence of the two theories as very much as the process of adding algebraic
numerals is very different from the process of adding roman numerals but the two processes nevertheless
always give the same result [5].

6.2 Linear Vector Space and Tensor Products
The quantum description of a state of a system is in terms of a vector. To understand the
implications of this kind of representation of a system, in this section, let us first introduce
the notion of linear vector space.
6.2.1 Linear Vector Space
A linear vector space is defined as a set of vectors A, B, C, . . . satisfying the following:
1. For every pair of vectors A and B there exists a C: C = A + B.
2. Vector addition is commutative and associative:
A + B = B + A , (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) = A + B + C . (6.1)
3. The origin of the vector space is the zero vector, 0.
4. Multiplication is distributive and associative:
a(A + B) = aA + aB , (a + b)A = aA + bA , a(bA) = (ab)A , (6.2)
where a and b are complex numbers.
5. For every vector A there exists −A such that A + (−A) = 0.
If a set of vectors A1, A2, . . ., AN obey the relation
c1A1 + c2A2 + . . . + cN AN = 0 , (6.3)
where c1, c2, . . ., cN are not all zero then A’s are said to be linearly dependent. When
no such c’s exist then the A’s are linearly independent. The maximum number of linearly
independent vectors in a vector space is the dimension of the vector space. The dimension
can be finite or infinite.
A linearly independent set of vectors An satisfying
ψ =
X
N
n=1
cnAn (6.4)
for every vector ψ in the linear vector space of dimension N is called a coordinate system
or bases vectors or simply bases for the vector space. Here any arbitrary vector in the space
may be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors in one and only one way. cn in
Eq. (6.4) are the components of ψ. The N-tuples of complex numbers (c1, c2, . . . , cN ) are
called vectors and are represented in matrix form as

called orthonormal if

FIGURE 6.1
Illustration of representation of a vector OA in two different base vectors (A1, A2) and
(A′
1
, A′
2
).
From a set of N linearly independent vectors we can construct an orthogonal set employing
the Schmidt orthogonalization procedure [6,7].
If the basis set An has N vectors then the space is N-dimensional. We can choose any
set of N linearly independent vectors which can span the same vector space. Any vector
represented in two different bases will have different components and the column matrices
will be different. We can write the basis vectors of one representation as a linear combination
of the basis vectors of a second representation. Hence, any two representations of the same
linear vector space will be related by a transformation and the transformation matrix will
be unitary if the norm of the vector is same in any representation.
Consider a vector OA shown in Fig. 6.1. Using the base vectors (A1, A2) the vector
OA is expressed as OA = aA1 + bA2. On the other hand, in terms of the base vectors
(A′
1
, A′
2
) we write OA = a
′A′
1 + b
′A′
2
. The change from one basis set to another is called
transformation of the base vectors. Suppose a problem is defined in (A1, A2). Assume that
solving it in terms of (A′
1
, A′
2
) is much simpler than with (A1, A2). Then we can go from
the set (A1, A2) to (A′
1
, A′
2
). This is similar to (q, p) → (Q, P) in classical mechanics.
Suppose a set of N orthonormal vectors {φn} forms a basis for a N-dimensional vector
space. Then we express any vector in the space as
ψ =
X
N
n=1
cnφn, cn = (φn, ψ), φ1 = [1 0 . . .], φ2 = [0 1 . . .] (6.7)
and so on. The inner product of two vectors ψ1 and ψ2 is given by
hψ1, ψ2i =
DX

cnφn,
X
m
dmφm
E
(6.8)
which is a number. We have hψ1, ψ2i = hψ2, ψ1i
∗
, where * denotes the complex conjugate.
If hψ1, ψ2i = 0 then ψ1 and ψ2 are said to be orthogonal. If the basis vectors {φn} are
orthonormal then hφn, φmi = δnm. Then in an orthonormal basis we have
hψ1, ψ2i =

Solved Problem 1:
Determine whether the following set of vectors are linearly independent or dependent. ψ1 =
3i + 2j − k, ψ2 = 3i + 6j − 3k, ψ3 = i + 2j − k.
Three vectors A1, A2 and A3 are linearly dependent if at least one Ci
, i = 1, 2, 3 is nonzero
in C1A1 + C2A2 + C3A3 = 0. For the given vectors we write
C1ψ1 + C2ψ2 + C3ψ3 = (3C1 + 3C2 + C3)i + (2C1 + 6C2 + 2C3)j
−(C1 + 3C2 + C3)k = 0 . (6.10)
From the above we have
3C1 + 3C2 + C3 = 0 , 2C1 + 6C2 + 2C3 = 0 , C1 + 3C2 + C3 = 0 . (6.11)
Solving the above three equations we get C1 = 0, C2 = 1, C3 = −3. Since not all the Ci
’s
are zero the three vectors are linearly dependent.
6.2.2 Tensor Products
The tensor product is a way of making vector spaces together to form larger vector spaces.
The construction is crucial for understanding the quantum mechanics of multiparticle sys￾tem. Suppose V and W are vector spaces of dimensions m and n, respectively. The V ⊗ W
(read V tensor W) is an mn-dimensional vector space. The elements of V ⊗ W are linear
combination of tensor products |vi ⊗ |wi of elements of |vi of V and |wi of W.
What sorts of linear operators act on the space V ⊗W? Suppose |vi and |wi are vectors
in V and W and A and B are linear operators in V and W, respectively. Then we define a
linear operator A ⊗ B in V ⊗ W by the equation
(A ⊗ B(|vi ⊗ |wi)) = A|vi ⊗ B|wi. (6.12)
Suppose A is an m×n matrix and B is a p×q matrix. Then we have the matrix representation
A ⊗ B =


Note that any valid arithmetical relation between two or more operators is also ap￾plicable between the corresponding matrices. The eigenvalues of an operator A are also
the eigenvalues of the matrix representation of the same operator. Similar result holds for
eigenfunctions also.
Hermitian operators are represented by Hermitian matrices. A matrix A is Hermitian
if A = A†
, where (Amn)
† = (Anm)
∗
. When A = −A†
it is anti-Hermitian. The following
properties are easy to verify:
1. The eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrices are real.
2. The eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix corresponding to different eigenvalues are
orthogonal.
3. The product of Hermitian matrices is a Hermitian if and only if they commute.
4. Commuting Hermitian matrices have simultaneous eigenvectors.
There exists an orthonormal basis φ1, φ2, . . . , φN for a Hermitian operator A in a linear
vector space of N-dimensions. In relative to φ’s the operator A is represented by a diagonal
matrix
A =

Notice that any operator in its own eigenvector basis is represented by a diagonal matrix.
The diagonal elements of A are the eigenvalues. Any vector ψ can be represented as a linear
combination of the eigenvectors of A, as
ψ =

6.4 Unitary Transformation
The representations in different basis system are related by unitary transformation as shown
below.
Suppose the set of functions {φn(x)} are orthonormal and A is an operator. Then the
matrix representation of A in the basis {φn(x)} is defined as Anm = (φn, Aφm). Any
arbitrary state ψ(x) is represented as
ψ(x) = X
n
cnφn(x), cn = (φn, ψ) . (6.22)
Now, consider a second orthonormal basis {φ

n
(x)}. The operator A and ψ(x) in this new
basis system are

The proof of Eq. (6.27) is left as an exercise to the reader. For the matrix form of the
operator we have
A
′
nm =
X
l,k
U
∗
lnAlkUkm or A
′ = U
†AU . (6.28)
Thus, the representations in different basis systems are related by unitary transformations.
We have TrAB = TrBA, detAB = (detA)(detB) and
TrA
′ = Tr(U
†AU) = Tr(U
†U)A = TrA. (6.29)Schro¨dinger Equation and Other Quantities in Matrix Form 165
Therefore, the trace and determinant of any operator are invariant under unitary trans￾formations. Hence, no operator has unique matrix representation. Any operator will have
different matrix representation in different basis. But all these matrices will have same
eigenvalues. Any matrix representation of an operator on an arbitrary basis can be brought
into a diagonal form by means of a unitary transformation of the arbitrary basis to the
eigenvector basis.
There are many ways of expressing a unitary operator U in terms of a Hermitian oper￾ator. The most common one is
U = eiQ =
X∞
n=0
(iQ)
n
n!
, (6.30)
where Q is Hermitian so that U
† = e−iQ†
= e−iQ and UU† = U
†U = I. Another useful
form is U = (1 + ik)/(1 − ik), where k is Hermitian.
Solved Problem 2:
What will happen to a unitary operator under a unitary transformation?
Let A′ = UAU†
. Consider A′†A′
. We get
A
′†A
′ = (UAU†
)
†
(UAU†
)
= (UA†U
†
)(UAU†
)
= UA†
(U
†U)AU†
= U(A
†A)U
†
= UU†
= I . (6.31)
Similarly, we can show that A′A′† = I. Thus, A′A′† = A′†A′ = I. Thus, a unitary operator
remains unitary under a unitary transformation.
6.5 Schrodinger Equation and Other Quantities in Matrix Form ¨
Suppose the energy eigenfunctions of a Hamiltonian operator are φ1, φ2, . . . , φn and the
corresponding energy eigenvalues are E1, E2, . . . , En so that Hφn = Enφn. Now,
Hnm = hφn, Hφmi = Emhφn, φmi = Emδnm , (6.32)
where φn’s are an orthonormal set of basis functions. H is a diagonal square matrix with
the diagonal elements Em.
Let us write the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation in matrix form. We write
ψ(X, t) = X

6.7 Dirac’s Bra and Ket Notations
As mentioned earlier the quantum state of a system can be represented in terms of a vector.
The values of the wave functions ψ(X) at various points X are the components of a vector.
The components depend on the choice of coordinate system or basis in the vector space.
Instead of specifying one or another set of infinitely many components, Dirac introduced a
vector notation for the state vector [8]. A state vector is represented by a symbol | i called
a ket. For example, ψ(X) is written as |ψi. Corresponding to every vector |ψi there is a
vector hψ| called bra vector, the complex conjugate of |ψi.
6.7.1 Basis Vectors
Recall from our discussion in earlier sections of this chapter that any vector can be written
in terms of a basis vector. What are the basis of a quantum system? A basis is essentially
constituted by the set of vectors with each possible outcome of a measurement of a particular
observable of the system. In other words, the eigenvectors of the operator of an observable
can always be used as the basis for the vector space.
In a three-dimensional vector (in physical space) v = ai + bj + ck, where i, j and k are
unit vectors along the x, y and z-axis, respectively, and a, b and c are the components of v
along the x, y and z-axes, respectively. In the same way, a quantum state |ψi is written as
|ψi = c1|φ1i + c2|φ2i + . . . , (6.66)
where the unit vectors |φ1i, |φ2i, . . ., etc are like the unit vectors i, j, k, . . . and the coeffi￾cients c1, c2, . . . are like a, b, c, . . .. However, ci
’s are generally complex. We write Eq. (6.66)172 Matrix Mechanics
as
|ψi =
X
i
ci
|φii or X
i
ci
|ii, (6.67)
where |ii denotes a unit vector or a base vector |φii. Then the bra state is hψ| =
P

c

The number of base vectors required in quantum mechanics depends on the situation. In

6.7.2 Examples of Basis in Quantum Theory
In this section, we give a few examples of basis in quantum mechanics [9].
1. Energy representation
Let the discrete energy eigenvalues of a particle are E1, E2, . . .. A measurement of energy
of the particle would yield one of Ei
’s. The set of basis vectors in this case is |E1i, |E2i,
. . .. The number of basis vectors is infinite.
2. Position representation
Consider a one-dimensional particle. A measurement of its position would give a real
number, say q. Denote |qi the state of the particle for which the outcome of position mea￾surement is q. The basis states are taken as the set {|qi}, where −∞ < q < ∞. As the
possible values of q are infinite, the number of basis vectors is infinite.
3. Momentum representation
Instead of position values we may measure the momentum p of the particle. In this case
the set {|pi}, where −∞ < p < ∞ forms the basis states. In this representation also the
number of basis vectors is infinite.
4. Spin representation
Consider a particle whose spin measurement in any direction gives ±~/2. If the spin
measurement in a direction e yields ~/2 then the corresponding state is, for example, labeled
as |1/2, ei. If the outcome is −~/2 then the state is | − 1/2, ei. The state of the spin
component in any direction is then represented in terms of the states |1/2, ei and |−1/2, ei.
Consequently, the number of basis vectors is only two.
The basis vectors in energy, position and momentum representations are
ψn(x) → |ψni → |ni or |ii, ψE(x) → |Ei, (6.69a)
ψq(x) → |qi, ψp(x) → |pi, (6.69b)
respectively. In terms of the basis vectors the state vector in these three representations in
ket notation are
ψ(x) → |ψi =
Xcn|ni or Xci

between ψm and ψn as
(ψn, ψm) = Z ∞
−∞
ψ
∗
nψm dτ = hψn|ψmi or hn|mi (6.71)
and is a number δnm. Observe that when the bra is on the left of a ket, that is, (hψn|)(|ψmi),
then they contract to give a number. hψn| and |ψmi are said to be orthogonal if hψn|ψmi = 0.
The basis vectors are orthonormal if hφi
|φj i = δij . On taking the inner product of Eq. (6.67)
successively with |φii and on using hφi
|φj i = δij we obtain ci = hφi
|ψi which gives the value
of the component of |ψi along |φii.
The c’s in Eq. (6.70) are given by
cn = hn|ψi, cq = hq|ψi, cp = hp|ψi. (6.72)
If λi
is the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector |φii of an operator Λ then the
probability of getting λi as an eigenvalue in a measurement is
P(λi) = |ci
|
2 = |hφi
|ψi|2
. (6.73)
Since the total probability is 1 we have P|ci
|
2 = 1. If a system is in the state |φii then the
state |ψi no longer exists. If |ψi is normalized to unity then
hψ|ψi =
Xhψ|φiihφi
|ψi =
X|hφi
|ψi|2 =
X|ci
|
2 = 1 . (6.74)
6.7.3 Properties of Ket and Bra Vectors
An operator by definition acts on one ket to produce another ket. In Dirac’s notation there
is a useful way of representing linear operators, known as the outer product representation.
For example, the inner product hv|wi is a complex number whereas |vihw| called the outer
product is an operator. If |w
′
i is some ket then the action of |vihw| on |w
′
i is defined by
|vihw|w
′
i = hw|w
′
i|vi.
What is the rule to obtain Hermitian conjugate of an expression? The rule contains
1. reversing the order of the terms in the expression and
2. changing
(a) the numbers into their complex conjugates
(b) the operators into their adjoints,
(c) the kets into bras and bras into kets.

6.8 Dimensions of Kets and Bras
In sec. 2.5 we noticed that the dimension of ψ(X, t) for a single particle in three-dimension
is (length)−3/2
, that is, L−3/2 and that of ψ(x, t) in one-dimension is L−1/2
. For the momen￾tum wave function Φ(p, t) the normalization condition R ∞
−∞ |Φ(p, t)|
2dp = 1 gives [Φ(p, t)] =
(MLT−1
)
−1/2
. Do kets and bras have dimensions? In this section, we determine the dimen￾sions of kets and bras [10].
Denote the dimension of a quantity Q as [Q]. If Q is dimensionless then [Q] = 1. The
dimensions of x and its conjugate momentum p are L and MLT−1
, respectively. For the
kets |αi and |βi we write [hα|βi] = [hα|][|βi] and as the complex conjugation does not alter
the dimension we write [hα|βi] = [hβ|αi] and [|αi] = [hα|]. For the physical state |ψi, the
continuous position basis {|xi} with ˆx|xi = x|xi, where ˆx is the position operator and the
continuous momentum basis {|pi} with ˆp|pi = p|pi, where ˆp is the momentum opterator we
denote
[|ψi] = K, [hψ|] = B, [|xi] = XK, [hx|] = XB, [|pi] = PK, [hp|i] = PB, (6.79)Dimensions of Kets and Bras 175
where K, B, XB, XK, PK and PB are dimensional formulas. [hψ|ψi] = 1 gives [hψ|][|ψi] =
BK = 1. That is, B = 1/K.
The position space wave function Ψ(x, t) is defined through the equation
hx|Ψi = hΨ|xi
∗ = Ψ(x, t) (6.80)
and this equation gives
XBK = BXK = L−1/2
. (6.81)
Substitution of B=1/K in the above equation gives
XBK = XKK
−1 = L−1/2
. (6.82)
Similarly, for Φ(p, t)
hp|Ψi = hΨ|pi
∗ = Φ(p, t). (6.83)
This equation gives
PBK = PKK
−1 =
￾
MLT−1
−1/2
. (6.84)
We can expand |Ψi in a discrete orthonormal basis {|ni} as
|Ψi =
X∞
n=1
Cn(t)|ni, Cn(t) = hn|Ψi, hn|mi = δnm . (6.85)
The normalization condition is
hΨ|Ψi =
X∞
m,n=1
C
∗
mCnhm|ni =
X∞
n=1
|Cn|
2
hn|ni = 1 . (6.86)
Equation (6.86) implies [Cn]
2
[hn|ni] = 1. This gives [Cn] = 1. With [|ni] = NK and [hn|] =
NB the Eq. (6.85) and its bra case lead to the result
K = NK , B = NB = K−1
. (6.87)
From the above we note that we cannot able to uniquely find the dimensions of the
various kets and bras. Therefore, for simplicity we decide that the dimension of the physical
state |ψi is K = 1.
Then considering
|ψi =
Z ∞
−∞

and
hψ| =
Z ∞
−∞
Ψ(y, t)
∗
hy| dy (6.89)
we can write [|ψi] = [hψ|] = 1. Further, [|αi] = [hα|] = K = 1. Now, from the Eqs. (6.79),
(6.82), (6.84) and (6.87) we write
K = B = NK = NB = 1 , XB = XK = L−1/2
, PB = PK =
￾
MLT−1
−1/2
. (6.90a)
That is,
[|ψi] = [hψ|] = 1 , [|xi] = [hx|] = L−1/2
, (6.91a)
[|pi] = [hp|] = ￾
MLT−1
−1/2
, [|ni] = [hn|] = 1 . (6.91b)
These results can be easily generalized to a N-particle syst176 Matrix Mechanics
6.9 Hilbert Space
Suppose a physical system is described by a set of linearly independent finite norm states de￾noted by |φ1i, |φ2i, . . .. The set {|φni} represents all the possible outcomes of measurements
of an observable A. Assume that
1. there is no linear combination of these vectors vanishing except when all the
coefficients are zero and
2. the set is complete so that |ψi =
Pcn|φni.
Then the space of the ket vectors |ψi is called a Hilbert space [11]. The basis of the Hilbert
space are the set |φni. The number of cn’s are the component of |ψi and gives a representa￾tion of |ψi. Thus, we write the cn’s in a column (or row) vector such that a state function
is represented by a column (or a row) vector in the Hilbert space. In this space we imagine
an axis for each φn(x) and treat cn the component of the vector in the direction of that
axis. The quantum states in Hilbert space are called state vectors.
Suppose |φ1i and |φ2i are two states in Hilbert space. The linear superposition of them
is |ψi = |φ1i+|φ2i. We cannot form a new state by superposition of a state with itself. The
state c1|φ1i + c2|φ1i is not a new state. This corresponds to the same state that |φ1i does.
That is, in the Hilbert space, we can multiply a state vector by a nonzero complex number,
however, the physical state is unchanged. The vectors |ψi, 5|ψi, −|ψi, −
√
2|ψi, i|ψi and
(2 + i3)|ψi all represent the same physical state. Their magnitudes or lengths are physically
unimportant. In this sense state vectors differ from conventional vectors.
A single point of Hilbert space represents the quantum state of the system. The origin
does not represent a state. A state vector is represented by a line passing through the origin.
Since |ψi and 5|ψi are equivalent, a line passing through the origin represents all possible
multiples of a state vector.
Each dimension of the Hilbert space corresponds to one of the rows of the one-column
matrix describing the state. That is, each dimension corresponds to one of the various
independent physical states of a quantum state. Essentially, the quantum description of a
system with observable assuming continuous values requires a continuous states. In this
case the dimension of the Hilbert space is infinite. Thus, the dimension of the Hilbert
space for energy, position and momentum representations is infinite. However, there are
many systems with discrete and finite sets of values of observables so that the dimension
of the associate Hilbert space is finite. In spin representation, for s = 1/2 the dimension
p
is two. Another example of an observable with finite values is angular momentum J =
j(j + 1)~. The corresponding dimension of the Hilbert space is 2j+1. Some mathematical
features of finite-dimensional Hilbert space for the position and momentum of a particle on
a one-dimensional lattice is discussed in ref. [12]. An interesting result associated with the
finite-dimensional Hilbert space is that one can choose an arbitrary normalized state as a
member of an orthonormal basis of the space [32] (see the exercise 6.22). The formulation of
quantum mechanics in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space has found applications in quantum
cryptography, quantum computers and quantum optics.
Let us see how position states and momentum states are represented in the same Hilbert
space. Consider a Hilbert space with each coordinate axis corresponds to a possible position
state of a single particle. The momentum state can also be represented in the same Hilbert
space. Momentum states are expressed as combination of position states. Therefore, each
momentum state corresponds to an axis going off-diagonally tilted with respect to the
position-space axes. The set of all momentum states forms a new set of axes. TransformationSymmetry Operators in Hilbert Space 177

6.10 Symmetry Operators in Hilbert Space
A pure state of a quantum mechnical system is usually described by a certain unit norm
vector ψ of a Hilbert space. If one prepares the system in a pure state ψ then the probability
of observing it to be in another pure state |φi is given by
P(|ψi → |φi) = |hφ|ψi|2
. (6.92)
If |ψi and |φi states have phase factors as |ψiR = eiα|ψi and |φiR = eiβ
|φi, where α and
β are all real then the probability |hφ|ψi|2
is not changed. Therefore, a pure state is really
described by a ray |ψiR =

e
iα|ψi; α ∈ R
	
, that is, the equivalence class of all vectors that is
obtained by multiplying |ψi by all possible phases. A vector in |ψiR is called a representative
of the ray |ψiR.
One of the most powerful techniques of extracting consequences about a physical system
is to identify the various symmetries exhibited by the system. A symmetry is a transforma￾tion of a physical system that does not change the results of possible experiments. Eugene
Paul Wigner [13,14] was the first who introduced the definition of symmetry operators in
quantum mechanics. Wigner symmetry is defined as the transformation of pure states de￾scribed by the rays |ψiR and |φiR into pure states described by the rays |ψi

R and |φi

that all probabilities are preserved. That is,
|Rhφ|ψiR|
2 = |

Rhφ|ψi

. (6.93)178 Matrix Mechanics
Hence, a symmetry transformation is a ray transformation T |ψiR = |ψi
′
R satisfying
Eq. (6.93). The nature of the symmetry transformation T is given by Wigner’s theorem
which states that:
Any symmetry transformation can be represented on the Hilbert space of physical states
by an operator that is either linear and unitary or anti-linear and anti-unitary.
In fact, all unitary operators are linear and all anti-unitary operators are anti-linear.
The transformation defined by T |ψiR = |ψi

R is unitary if

Rhψ|φi

R = Rhψ|φiR (6.94)
and anti-unitary if
′
Rhψ|φi
′
R = Rhψ|φi
∗
R = Rhφ|ψiR. (6.95)
It can be seen that Eqs. (6.94) and (6.95) satisfy (6.93). A unitary operator U is such that
RhUψ|UφiR = Rhψ|U
†U|φiR = Rhψ|φiR (6.96)
for all states |φiR and |ψiR so that U
†U = UU† = I and is linear so that
U (C1|φiR + C2|ψiR) = C1U|φiR + C2U|ψiR, (6.97)
where C1 and C2 are arbitrary complex numbers. An anti-unitary operator is such that
RhAψ|AφiR = Rhψ|φi
∗
R = Rhφ|ψiR (6.98)
and is anti-linear so that

As the symmetry operators form a group Wigner laid the foundations both for the ap￾plication of group theory to quantum mechanics and for the role of symmetry principles in
quantum mechanics. These symmetry groups can be classified into either continuous groups
or discrete groups. Continuous symmetries are characterized by invariance following a con￾tinuous changes in some parameters of the system. Space-time symmetries such as rotation,
boost (together forms proper orthochronous Lorentz transformations) and transition belong
to this group. It can be shown that continuous symmetry transformations are represented
by unitary operators. Discrete symmetries are characterized by invariance following a non￾continuous change in the system space-time symmetries. The space-time symmetries such as
time reversal (T ) and parity (P), which together form improper Lorentz transformations,
belong to this class. It can be shown that parity symmetry can be represented by uni￾tary operators. But the time reversal symmetry T can be represented only by anti-unitary
operators.
Apart from the space-time symmetries other symmetry principles used in the fundamet￾nal physical theories are:
1. Charge conjucate symmetry (discret symmetry existing between particles and the
anti-particles).
2. The permutation symmetry existing between the identical particles (which leads
to two different statistics, namely, Bose-Einstein statistics and Fermi–Dirac statis￾tics).Projection and Displacement Operators 179
3. Unitary internal symmetry (gauge symmetries) described by the unitary groups
SU(N).
4. Supersymmetry (the symmetry between fermions and bosons).
Physical symmetries play a crucial role in the progress of theoretical physics. They occupy
a leading place in the eloboration and testing of fundamental theories and they offer a basis
for proceeding towards theoretical unification.
6.11 Projection and Displacement Operators
Let the eigenkets |ii of an operator Ω have eigenvalues ωi
. Since the set of kets |ii form
a complete set, any arbitrary ket |αi is expanded as |αi =
P
i
ai
|ii, where ai = hi|αi is a
number. We write
|αi =
X
i
|iihi|αi =
X
i
Pi
|αi, (6.100)
where Pi = |iihi| is called the projection operator [15] for the ith state. In
Pi
|αi = |iihi|αi (6.101)
the operator Pi projects only the particular eigenstate |ii of Ω among |αi. Hence, it is called
a projection operator . From (6.100) and (6.101) we find that
X
i
Pi
|αi =
X
i
|iihi|αi = |αi. (6.102)
The result is PPi = I. What does it state? We have
P
2
i
|αi = |iihi|iihi|αi = |iihi|αi = Pi
|αi. (6.103)
This gives P
2
i = Pi
. Further, PjPi
|αi = |jihj|iihi|αi = 0. Therefore, PjPi = 0. Combining
P
2
i = Pi and PjPi = 0 we get PiPj = PjPi = δijPi
.
Any operator A can be written as A = IAI. Therefore, the completeness relation is
A =
X
i
|iihi|A|
X
j
|jihj| =
X
i
X
j
|iihi|A|jihj| =
X
i
X
j
|iihj|Aij , (6.104)
where Aij is the matrix element hi|A|ji. Thus, A is written as a linear combination (with
coefficients Aij ) of the operator |iihj|. If A = Ω, then hi|Ω|ji = ωj hi|ji = ωj δij and
Ω = X
i
X
j
|iihj|ωj δij =
X
i
Piωi
. (6.105)
Thus, any observable can be written as a weighted sum of projection operators to their own
eigenstates. The weighting factors are the eigenvalues. More generally, for any function of
Ω, we have f(Ω) = P
i
f(ωi)|iihi| =
Pf(ωi)Pi
.
When the eigenstates of an observable are used as bases for representations then the
observable is defined in relation to a coordinate system, say, S : oxyz in ordinary space. A
change in the observable arises if there is a change in the coordinate system. This results
in a transformation of the basis in the Hilbert space. Suppose the basis transformation is
made by a translation (shifting the origin without altering the orientation of the axes). Let
us investigate the effect of translation on a wave function of a system.180 Matrix Mechanics
Let us consider that a one-dimensional system is displaced through a distance along the
x-axis. The final wave function is unknown because it can be multiplied by a phase factor.
Since superposition relations between eigenstates are unchanged under the displacements
we write
ψUD = φ
a
UD + φ
b
UD , (6.106)
where ψUD is the wave function of the undisplaced system. Here assume that the system
has only two eigenstates φ
a
UD and φ
b
UD. Equation (6.106) for the displaced system is ψD =
φ
a
D + φ
b
D. Now, define an operator called displacement operator [16], the effect of it on ψUD
is to give ψD: DψUD = ψD. An example is Dψ(x) = ψ(x + δ). The displacement operator
is widely used in quantum computation.
Let us calculate hD†Di. We obtain

DψD dx = 1 . (6.107)
Since this is valid for any eigenfunction we have DD† = 1, D is a unitary.
Suppose γ is an operator such that γφa
UD = φ
b
UD and γdφ
a
D = φ
b
D, where γd is the
displaced operator [16]. We have
γdφ
a
D = Dφb
UD = Dγφa
UD = DγD†φ
a
D . (6.108)
Thus, γd = DγD†
. For an infinitesimal displacement δ of the system we write

Defining

(6.110)
and since D can be replaced by De
iθ

δ
= lim
δ→0
D − 1 + iθ
δ
= d + iγ , (6.111)
where γ = limδ→0(θ/δ).
Is the operator d Hermitian? To answer this, for small δ we write D = 1 + δd. Then
DD† = 1 becomes (1 + δd†
)(1 + δd) = 1. Neglecting δ
2 we obtain d
† + d = 0 or d
† = −d.
Thus, the displacement operator d is anti-Hermitian.
Examples:
Assume that the system is displaced along x-direction by an amount, say, δx. The old
and new wave functions are ψ(x) and ψ(x − δx), respectively. Then xd = x − δx. Replacing
x by γ we have γd = γ − δx or (γd − γ)/δx = −1. Now, the above equation becomes
[d, γ] = [dx, x] = −1. That is, xdx − dxx = 1. Multiplication on both sides by i~ gives
xi~dx − i~dxx = i~[x, dx] = i~ . (6.112)
Comparison of this equation with xpx −pxx = i~ gives dx = −d/dx. Thus, the result is that
the displacement operator in the x-direction is proportional to the momentum conjugate to
x. Hence, px is the generator of translations along the x-axis. Since any finite translation
along the x-axis can be constructed from a series of many infinitesimal translations we write

Next, consider the change of representation induced by a rotation of coordinate axes,
say, from S : oxyz to S

z
′ about oz through an angle θ. We have
x
′ = x cos θ + y sin θ, y′ = −x sin θ + y cos θ, z′ = z . (6.116)
Since the wave function is independent of the orientation of the coordinate axes we write
ψ

(X′

cos θ ≈ 1 and sin θ ≈ θ we obtain

6.12 Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics
In the year 1843, William Rowan Hamilton discovered a new mathematical object called
quaternion [17]. A complex number c is defined as c = a+bi, where (a, b) ∈ R
2 and i = √
−1.
A quaternion q is given as q = a + bi + cj + dk with 1, i, j, k are the directions of q. The
components of q form the set H(a, b, c, d) ∈ R
4
, where R
4
is a four-dimensional vector
space over the real numbers. H has three operations: addition, scalar multiplication and
quaternion multiplication. The sum of two elements of H, say, q1 = a1 + b1i + c1j + d1k and
q2 = a2 + b2i + c2j + d2k is
q1 + q2 = (a1 + a2) + (b1 + b2)i + (c1 + c2)j + (d1 + d2)k. (6.121)182 Matrix Mechanics
The multiplication rules for i, j and k are: i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1. The multiplication of
two quaternions q1 and q2 is given by
q1 ∗ q2 = (a1 + b1i + c1j + d1k)(a2 + b2i + c2j + d2k)
= (a1a2 − b1b2 − c1c2 − d1d2) + (a1b2 + b1a2 + c1d2 − d1c2)i
+(a1c2 − b1d2 + c1a2 + d1b2)j + (a1d2 + b1c2 − c1b2 + d1a2)k. (6.122)
The theory of quaternions has found applications in classical mechanics, quantum me￾chanics and relativity. It has been used in aerospace applications, flight simulators, computer
graphics, animation, visualization, fractals and virtual reality.
6.12.1 Operators and States
As the quaternions are noncommutative the left and right action of the quaternionic imag￾inary units i, j and k are different. The left L = (Li
, Lj
, Lk) and right R = (Ri
, Rj
, Rk)
operators are introduced. They act on the quaternionic function ψH as LqψH = qψH and
RpψH = ψHp, p, q = i, j, k. These quaternionic operators satisfy the relations LqLp = Lqp,
RqRp = Rpq and [Lq, Rp] = 0.
Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner [18] proposed a possible generalization of quantum
theory with respect to the background field way back in 1934. Birkhoff and von Neu￾mann [19] proposed the use of quaternions to develop a new quantum mechanics which
was developed by Finkelstein [20,21] and Adler [22]. We give below some basic concepts of
quaternionic quantum mechanics.
Similar to the complex quantum mechanics the states of the quaternionic quantum
mechanics is also described by wave functions belonging to an abstract vector space, namely,
the quaternionic Hilbert space. Quaternionic quantum mechanics is a modification of the
complex quantum theory in which the wave functions belong to a Hilbert space defined
over the quaternion field. The quantum state of particle is defined at a given instant by
quaternionic wave function interpreted as a probability amplitude given by
ψH(r) = ψR,0(r) + iψR,1(r) + jψR,2(r) + kψR,3(r), (6.123)
where ψR,0, ψR,1, ψR,2 and ψR,3 are real functions of real variables r. The probability inter￾pretation of ψH requires that it belongs to the Hilbert space of square-integral functions.
The same ψH can be represented by several distinct sets of components in the same
vector space corresponding to different choice of basis. Let ψH and φH belong to the same
vector space. Then the quaternionic scalar product is given by (ψH, φH) = R
ψ¯HφHd
3
r, where
ψ¯H = ψR,0 − iψR,1 − jψR,2 − kψR,3 represents the quaternionic conjugate of ψH.
Due to the noncommutative nature of quaternionic multiplication, the right and left
multiplications by quaternionic scalars will not be the same. For the quaternionic quantum
mechanics we have to consider the Hilbert space of linearity of right multiplication [22].

Equation (6.129) is the stationary state eigenvalue problem.
As HH is anti-Hermiticity, that is, (φH, HHψH) = −(HHφH, ψH) we have E = −E¯ =
−(iE1 + jE2 + kE3). Then the quaternionic stationary state eigenvalue equation is
HHφH = −φH(iE1 + jE2 + kE3)/~. (6.130)
Now, consider ψH = φHe

(∇ψ¯H)iψH − ψ¯Hi∇ψH

(6.133)
and the probability density ρ = ψ¯HψH. They satisfy the continuity equation ∂ρ/∂t+∇·J = 0.
Hence, the probability is conserved.
Quaternionic bound states and scattering states of certain systems were reported [23–
27]. An experiment was proposed [28] to identify quaternionic deviations from standard
quantum mechanics. The noncommutativity of quaternionic phases could be observable
experimentally in Bragg scattering by a crystal made of three different atoms in neutron
interferometry. The experiment results were reported [29]. In the experiment, phase-shifts184 Matrix Mechanics
commute to better than one in 3 × 104
. In order to explain the observed null shift it has
been argued that quaternionic potentials act only for certain fundamental forces [30].
Quaternionic quantum mechanics is still in early stage of development. It is quite difficult
physically interpret quaternionic potentials and the quaternionic solutions. Consequently,
no conclusive experimental proof has been found for quaternionic quantum mechanics. Still
it is generally, believed that quaternionic Hilbert space dynamics may play a role as an
underlying dynamics of the standard model.
6.13 Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we outlined the matrix mechanics for quantum mechanical systems. In this
theory the behaviour of a quantum mechanical system is determined by the matrices of
p and X. The Hamiltonian is a diagonal matrix having diagonal elements En, the energy
eigenvalues. To solve Hψ = Eψ as a matrix problem, we need to find an appropriate linear
vector space. We note that instead of characterizing a vector ψ by its components with
respect to a particular coordinate system, it is convenient to use the coordinate independent
vector. We can characterize a vector on some basis {φn}. In this case the vector ψ itself
does not change, only its components with respect to the coordinate axes change under
the transformation from one basis to another basis, for example, say from {φn} to {φn′}.
We have shown that unitary transformation relates the representations in different basis
systems. A unitary transformation from one representation of |ψi to another corresponds
to a rotation of axis in the Hilbert space without change in the state vectors. For example,
the energy representation corresponds to choosing axes in such a way that a state vector
oriented along one of these axes is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Though the wave
mechanics and matrix mechanics are logically distinct, they are equivalent in all respects.
Schr¨odinger emphasized that wave mechanics and matrix mechanics have very intimate
inner connections [3] and established the mathematical identity of the two theories based
on the coordination of a matrix with a well-ordered function symbols [3,31]. von Neumann
did this by considering Fz and FΩ are isomorphic [19] with Fz and FΩ denoting the space
of square-summable sequences and space of square-integrable functions, respectively. For a
discussion of this inner connection with reference to a particle in a box potential one may
refer to the ref. [31].

Various Pictures and Density Matrix
7.1 Introduction
In classical mechanics the state of a system is defined by the numerical values of a set
of dynamical variables such as the position coordinates and the velocities. In quantum
mechanics the state of a system at an instant is represented by a unit vector in a Hilbert
space, where a set of axes are the eigenvectors of a complete set of observables. Here the
observable are not the state vectors but the expectation values of a set of self-adjoint or
Hermitian operators corresponding to the dynamical variables. The variation of hAi with
time is seen as arising in any one of the following ways:
1. The state vector changes with time, but the operator A remains unchanged.
2. The operator changes with time, whereas the state vector remains unchanged.
3. Both the operator A and the state vector change with time.
These three cases are called Schro¨dinger , Heisenberg and interaction pictures, respectively.
The time evolution of ensembles is described by means of a density matrix. We discuss the
above mentioned pictures and density matrix in this chapter.
7.2 Schrodinger Picture ¨
The description of quantum dynamics where the wave function is time-dependent and the
operators describing the observables are time-independent is known as the Schr¨odinger
picture.
7.2.1 Matrix Form of Schrodinger Equation ¨
The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation in Dirac’s notation is given by Eq. (6.77). Its
Hermitian adjoint is
−i~
∂
∂thψ| = hψ|H . (7.1)
Since the dependence of |ψi on coordinate or other variables is not explicit we replace ∂/∂t
by d/dt. If H is independent of time t then the solution of Eq. (7.1) is
|ψ(t)i = e−iHt/~
|ψ(0)i and hψ(t)| = hψ(0)|e
iHt/~
. (7.2)

. (7.4)
It is possible to represent U(t) as a square matrix. What is the effect of U(t) = e−iHt/~
on |ψ(0)i? Its significant effect is to change |ψ(0)i into |ψ(t)i. Therefore, the operator U(t)
is termed as the evolution operator . It is also called the propagator . We note that if H is Her￾mitian then U
†U = ei(H†−H)t/~ = e0 = 1 implying that U is unitary. As |ψ(t)i = U(t)|ψ(0)i
one can say that U(t) governs the intrinsic features of quantum dynamics. Suppose the states
are specified by the eigenectors of the position operator. Then the transition amplitude to
go from a point x
′ at time t = 0 to the point x at time t is determined by hx|U(t)|x
′
i. It is
also called the Green’s function [1,2].
Equation (7.2) shows that the time evolution is represented by a unitary transformation.
Because the origin of time has no significance U depends on time differences only. From
Eq. (7.2) for t = t1 we write
|ψ(t1)i = e−iHt1/~
|ψ(0)i (7.5)
and
|ψ(0)i = eiHt1/~
|ψ(t1)i. (7.6)
Then
|ψ(t)i = e−iH(t−t1)/~
|ψ(t1)i. (7.7)
In Eqs. (6.77) and (7.2) the operator is time-independent, whereas the wave function
is time-dependent. This representation of a quantum mechanical system is referred as a
Schro¨dinger picture. In this picture, all operators are written as functions of (the time￾independent operators) xS and pxS where the subscript S is used to denote the Schr¨odinger
representation.
7.2.2 Equation of Motion in the Schrodinger Picture ¨
We proceed to obtain the evolution equation of an operator. The expectation value of an
observable AS is
hASi = hψS(t)|AS|ψS(t)i. (7.8)
The time-dependent kets are given by Eq. (7.2). Differentiation of Eq. (7.8) with respect to
time gives

h[AS, H]i, (7.10)
where [AS, H] is the commutator of AS and H. This is the equation of motion of the expecta￾tion value of a dynamical variable AS. The first term in the right-side of this equation arises
from the explicit time-dependence in AS and the second term is from the time development
of the states. If AS has no explicit time-dependence then

hASi =

h[AS, H]i or

h[H, AS]i. (7.11)
This is the equation of motion of the expectation value of a dynamical variable AS in the
Schr¨odinger representation and is called the Schro¨dinger equation of motion. What do we
infer if [AS, H] = 0? In this case dhASi/dt = 0 and the operator is said to be an invariant.
What is the significance of an invariant property of an operator? We deduce the following
two major results from Eq. (7.11).
1. The expectation value of an observable whose operator commutes with the Hamil￾tonian is time-independent.
2. If the system is initially in an energy eigenstate then hAi will become time￾independent. The system will remain in that eigenstate forever.
For convenience define the total time derivative of any operator as
dAS

=
∂AS

,
d

(f(t)A) = df

(7.13)
These imply that the total derivative satisfies the same algebraic rules as ordinary deriva￾tives. Because of this the total time derivative is not defined as a rate of change of anything.
Does it matter? It is not necessary to think it as differentiation in the usual sense; it is
enough to know that it obeys the same algebraic rules. The fact that it is not defined to
be a rate of change of anything does not matter because the operator relations are never
the end result, they are means to find eigenfunctions, expectation values of observables and
eigenvalues.
The use of total time derivative of operator that depends on the time evolution of the
wave function as well as on any intrinsic time-dependence in the operators simplifies the
development of quantum mechanics and allows the development to more closely follow the
corresponding development of classical mechanics.
We illustrate below the use of the total time derivative for a free particle and linear
harmonic oscillator. For a few other interesting systems the reader may refer to ref. [3].192 Various Pictures and Density Matrix

Thus, hpxSi is independent of time. The solution of Eqs. (7.15) is

hpxS(0)it + hxS(0)i, hpxS(t)i = hpxS(0)i. (7.16)

7.3 Heisenberg Picture
Consider the circumstances where an operator is time-dependent and the wave function is
time-independent.
7.3.1 Operators and Kets in a Heisenberg Picture
Consider the expectation value of the operator A given by
hASi = hψS(t)|AS|ψS(t)i. (7.24)
Using Eq. (7.2) we have
hASi =


ψS(0)

e
iHt/~AS e
−iHt/~

ψS(0)
= hψS(0)|AH(t)|ψS(0)i, (7.25a)
where
AH(t) = eiHt/~AS e
−iHt/~
. (7.25b)
Suppose we define |ψH(t)i such that
hAH(t)i = hψH(t)|AH|ψH(t)i. (7.25c)
Comparison of Eqs. (7.25a) and (7.25c) gives hAH(t)i = hASi provided
|ψH(t)i = |ψH(0)i, AH(t) = eiHt/~AS e
−iHt/~
. (7.26)
In this case the ket |ψH(t)i is time-independent while AH is time-dependent. This represen￾tation is called Heisenberg representation. Here
hASi = |AH(t)i = |ψS(0)|AH(t)|ψS(0)i. (7.27)
The result is that the expectation value of a time-independent operator AS in a time￾dependent state is same as the expectation value of a time-dependent operator AH(t) in the
time-independent state |ψS(0)i. Though, the operator in Eq. (7.25b) is written as AH(t),
it is actually function of x(0), p(0) and t. It should be noted from Eq. (7.25b) that H and
any operator that commutes with H are same in both Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg pictures.
This is because AH = eiHt/~ASe
−iHt/~ = eiHt/~
e
−iHt/~AS = AS.194 Various Pictures and Density Matrix
In the Heisenberg picture, the kets and operators are labeled with the subscript H.
Because the kets are time-independent we simply write |ψHi. The kets are given by |ψH(t)i =
|ψH(0)i = |ψS(0)i. The basic set of observables for the Heisenberg picture is generally defined
in such a way that no explicit time-dependence appears in the state vectors. From this and
from Eq. (7.2) it is clear that the kets in the Heisenberg picture are simply the kets in the
Schr¨odinger picture at t = 0. What about the operators in these two representations? Do
they coincide at all times t or only at t = 0?

Equation (7.30) governs time evolution of an operator in Heisenberg representation and is
called the Heisenberg equation of motion.

derivative of its Heisenberg picture version.

Equations (7.33) have the same form of Hamilton’s classical canonical equation of motion.
If the potential V has only a constant or linear or quadratic term corresponding to the cases
of no force, constant force and harmonic motion, respectively, then it is easy to establish
that hqii and hpii in any state evolve exactly like those of classical mechanics.

7.4 Interaction Picture
Now, we take up the case of both the operators and the wave function varying with time.
7.4.1 Kets and Operators
Suppose the Hamiltonian of a system is split into two parts H0 and H′
, where H0 is inde￾pendent of time and H′
is time-dependent. Such could be the case if a system is subjected
to an external time-dependent field. In this case, the Schr¨odinger equation is
i~
∂
∂t|ψSi = (H0 + H′
)|ψSi. (7.36)
Let us introduce the interaction representation as
|ψinti = eiH0t/~
|ψSi. (7.37)
Replacing |ψSi using Eq. (7.37) in Eq. (7.36) we get
i~e
−iH0t/~ ∂
∂t|ψinti = H′
e
−iH0t/~
|ψinti. (7.38)
Premultiplying the above equation by eiH0t/~ gives
i~
∂
∂t|ψinti = eiH0t/~H
′
e
−iH0t/~
|ψinti = H
′
int|ψinti, (7.39a)
where
H′
int = eiH0t/~H′
e
−iH0t/~
. (7.39b)
For all operators we write
Aint = eiH0t/~ASe
−iH0t/~
. (7.40)
The time evolution of ket is governed by the part H′
int while that of the operator is by
the unperturbed part H0. All operators are treated as functions of xS(0), pxS(0) and t.
If Aint commute with H0 then Aint = AS. That is, it is identical to the operator in the
Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg pictures. From Eqs. (7.37) and (7.40) we see that the time
dependence is associated with |ψinti and also with Aint. In this way interaction picture is a
sort of intermediate between Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg pictures.

Differentiation of Eq. (7.40) with respect to t leads to

The evolution equations of xint and pxint for a free particle and linear harmonic oscillator
can be obtained easily (given as problems at the end of this chapter).Comparison of Three Representations 197
7.5 Comparison of Three Representations
The difference between the Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg pictures is best understood as the
difference in the basic set of observables. The basic set of observables for Heisenberg picture
is defined so that no explicit time dependence appears in the state vectors. In this picture all
operators are written as functions of xS, pxS and t. In the Schr¨odinger picture, all operators
are functions of xS and pxS. An operator A which has no explicit time dependence in the
Schr¨odinger picture, appears with an explicit time dependence in the Heisenberg picture.
Table 7.1 gives the comparison of the three pictures.
7.6 Density Matrix for a Single System
Generally, the many-body wave function ψ(q1, . . . , q3N , t) is too large to calculate for a
macroscopic system. In this case we may leave the information about individual systems
and wish to know the average properties of an ensemble of identical and noninteracting
systems. That is, we aim to use the concept of ensembles to derive the expectation value of
a dynamical variable A without directly finding the wave function. In this case we may speak
of density operator and its matrix representation called density matrix . This formalism was
introduced by John von Neumann and independently by Lev Landau and Felix Bloch.
Consider a single member of an ensemble and let it be in the state |ψi. We expand |ψi
as
|ψi =
X
n
cn|φni =
X
n
cn|ni,
X|cn|
2 = 1, (7.42)
where |φni are orthonormal set of vectors. We define the trace of an operator A in matrix
representation with the basis set {|φni} as
trA =
X
n
hφn|A|φni =
X
n
hn|A|ni. (7.43)
Then hAi is given by
hAi = hψ|A|ψi =
X
m
X
n
cmc
∗
n
hφn|A|φmi. (7.44)
We define a matrix ρ with elements ρmn given by

Writing Anm = hφn|A|φmi we have
hAi =
X
m

(ρA)nn = Tr(ρA). (7.46)
The matrix ρ with the elements given by Eq. (7.45) is called a density matrix of the single
system. There exists an operator called a density operator corresponding to the density
matrix and is defined as
ρ = |ψihψ| . (7.47)198 Various Pictures and Density Matrix TABLE 7.1 Comparison of Schr¨odinger, Heisenberg and interaction pictures.

The density operator is the quantum analog of the classical density function. It is easy to
verify that the elements of ρ defined by Eq. (7.47) are simply given by Eq. (7.45). Considering
{|φni}, ρmn are given by hφm|ρ|φni. We have
hφm|ρ|φni = cmc
∗
n
hφm|φmihφn|φni = cmc
∗
n = ρmn . (7.48)
When m = n we obtain ρnn = |cn|
2 which implies that the diagonal matrix elements of the
density operator represent the probabilities of the system in the base states.
Solved Problem 4:
For the density operator ρ determine (i) Tr(ρA), (ii) Tr(ρ) = 1, (iii) Tr(ρ
2
) and (iv) whether
ρ is Hermitian.
(i) Starting from Tr(ρA) we get
Tr(ρA) = X
n
hn|ρA|ni =
X
n
hn|ψihψ|A|ni = hψ|A|ψi = hAi. (7.49)
(ii) We obtain
Tr(ρ) = Tr(ρ1) = hψ|1|ψi = 1. (7.50)
(iii) First, we find ρ
2
. Using the definition of ρ we get
ρ
2 = |ψihψ|ψihψ| = |ψihψ| = ρ . (7.51)
Since ρ
2 = ρ we have Tr(ρ
2

ρmn = cmc

Hence, ρ is a Hermitian.
7.7 Density Matrix for an Ensemble
Suppose we consider an ensemble of systems with N members. If all the members are in
the same state |ψi then the ensemble is said to be a pure ensemble and the state is a pure
state. In a mixed ensemble at least one member must be in a state different from |ψi. Let
Nn be the number of identical members out of N members. If an is the eigenvalue of an
operator of Nn identical members with |ψi =
P
n
cn|φni then the probability |cn|
2
is given
by
|cn|
2 = lim

Instead of identical members, an ensemble may have members with distinct states. When
there are Ni members in the ith state |ψii then the probability of finding a member in the
ith state |ψii is given by pi = Ni/N and Ppi = 1. Then h A i is
h A i =

h A i can be expressed in terms ρ of the ensemble where ρ =

Let us enumerate the properties of the density operator ρ.

Since hn|ψii and hψi
|A|ni are numbers we rewrite Eq. (7.56) as
Tr(ρA) = X
n
X
i
pihψi
|A|nihn|ψii =
X
i
pihψi
|A|ψii = hAi. (7.57)
Thus, h A i depends only on ρ. Once ρ is known we need not consider the individual
systems to calculate ensemble average.

ρ associated with |ψii we write h ρ i =
P
i
piai
. Comparison of this with the Eq. (7.61)
indicates that ai = |hψi
|ψii|2 and hence the eigenvalues of hρi are nonnegative and the
matrix ρ is positive.

Let us consider the Schr¨odinger equation with H(t). We write
i~

Its solution can be represented as
|ψ(t)i = U(t, 0)|ψ(0)i, (7.202 Various Pictures and Density Matrix
where U expresses the time development of |ψ(0)i. Substituting Eq. (7.65) in Eq. (7.64) we

7.9 Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we presented the description of quantum dynamics in three different pic￾tures. We have shown the connection between the total time derivative of operators in the
various pictures. We have compared the three representations. The Heisenberg picture is
better suited to bring out fundamental features, such as symmetries and conservation laws,
and it is indispensable in systems with many degrees of freedom, like those dealt within
quantum field theory and statistical physics. No matter which picture is applied to explain
the dynamics of a quantum system, the laws of motion of the micro-system are all identical.
As the three pictures are equivalent and connected by unitary transformations, we must
choose the picture in which the physical properties of a system are more evident and the
calculations are simple. We discussed the features of density matrix. For more details on
density matrix formalism and its applications refer to refs. [4–6]. Quantun dynamics of a
driven damped harmonic oscillator in Heisenberg picture is reported [7,8].

Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
8.1 Introduction
One of the most striking deviations of quantum mechanics from classical mechanics is that
any measurement of a microscopic system involves the interaction with the measuring instru￾ments. The interaction cannot be neglected and in fact leads to uncontrollable disturbance
on the system. Let a measurement of an observable A yield the value a and be the eigen￾value of the operator A belonging to the eigenfunction φa. The individual measurements
will deviate from the average value (hai) computed over large number (N) of measurements.
Denote the deviation of a from hai as ˜a. What would be the value of average deviation? We
obtain
ha˜i =
1
N
X(a − hai) = hai − hai = 0 . (8.1)
This is because some of the values of a are below hai while the others are above hai.
Therefore, ha˜i is not useful for describing how much an individual value of an observable
deviates from the expected or mean value. The mean-square deviation or variance (σ

The square-root of mean-square deviation is called standard deviation or dispersion. This
quantity could be taken as a measure of the spread in the measured values. When most of
the values a are near hai then the distribution of a peaks about hai and in this case σ is
small. If most of the values of a are found over a wide range about hai then the distribution
spreads over a wide range of a with a large value of σ. This spread, denoted as ∆A, in the
measured values of A, is called the uncertainty in the measurement of A.
In 1927, Werner Karl Heisenberg in his celebrated paper [1] (Nobel Prize in 1932) es￾tablished the quantitative expression for unavoidable momentum disturbance caused by
any position measurement. Essentially, any measurement of the position x of a mass with
∆x would cause a disturbance ∆px on the momentum (px) measurement and ∆x and
∆px should always obey the relation ∆x∆px ≥ ~/2. Heisenberg explained the physi￾cal intuition underlying the above expression through the gamma-ray microscope thought
experiment.
In this chapter, first we derive the classical uncertainty relation. Next, we give a proof
of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Then we present a modified form of it.

8.2 The Classical Uncertainty Relation
Let A be a classical statistical variable with mean hAi. The uncertainty in A, ∆A, is defined
by
(∆A)
2 = σ
2
A =
1
N
X(A − hAi)
2 = h(A − hAi)
2
(8.3)
The above can be rewritten as
(∆A)
2 = hA
2
i − hAi
2
. (8.4)
This is the variance of A. The variance between two variables A and B is given by [2,3]
σAB = h(A − hAi)(B − hBi)i = hABi − hAihBi. (8.5)
Let us define
A˜ = A − hAi, B˜ = B − hBi (8.6)
which implies hA˜i = hB˜i = 0 and
(∆A)
2 = hA˜2
i, (∆B)
2 = hB˜2
i, σAB = hA˜B˜i. (8.7)
For a statistical variable x that is not always 0 we have hx
2
i ≥ 0. When x = A˜ + λB˜ we
find
hx
2
i = hA˜2
i + λ
2
hB˜2
i + 2λhA˜B˜i ≥ 0 . (8.8)
An equality sign will be realized if and only if A˜ + λB˜ = 0. The nature of the roots of λ is
determined from the quantity
α = 4hA˜B˜i
2 − 4hA˜2
ihB˜2
i. (8.9)
When α is 0 the roots of λ are real and identical. That is, there is one real root of λ. Roots
are complex for α < 0 while they are real and distinct if α > 0. Thus, the condition for at
most one real root of λ is (What would happen if there are two real roots of λ?)
hA˜B˜i
2 − hA˜2
ihB˜2
i ≤ 0 . (8.10)
When the Eqs. (8.7) are used the above equation becomes σ
2
AB − (∆A)

(∆B)
2 ≤ 0 or
(∆A)(∆B) ≥ |σAB| . (8.11)
This is the uncertainty principle for classical statistics [2,3].

Equation (8.29) is known as Heisenberg uncertainty principle1
. It is the uncertainty principle
for any pair of observables A and B. This equation with equality sign is commonly referred
as the minimum uncertainty product. In Eq. (8.29)
(∆A)
2 = hA
2
i − hAi
2
(8.30)
is variance in A. Similarly (∆B)

is defined.
For a canonically conjugate pair of operators A and B we have [A, B] = i~. Hence,
(∆A)
2
(∆B)
2 ≥ ~
2
/4 (8.31)
or
(∆A)(∆B) ≥ ~/2 . (8.32)
Thus, the statement of the uncertainty principle is the following:
The value of both the observables of a canonically conjugate pairs of a quantum mechanical
system cannot be specified precisely and simultaneously.
The crucial word here is simultaneously. The uncertainty relation gives the lower bound on
the product of the uncertainties of two pairs of variables. But it says nothing about the
1This principle was enunciated by Heisenberg when he was just 25 years old.Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation 209
accuracy with which individual observables can be measured. An important point is that
the uncertainty relation has nothing to do with the precision of the measuring instrument or
technique. Rather, it is an inherent characteristic of the quantum mechanical systems. The
uncertainty relation is not obtained based on experimental data. Without the uncertainty
principle, quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory.
Because [x, px] = i~, the position-momentum uncertainty principle is
(∆x)(∆px) ≥ ~/2 , (8.33)
where

2 = hx

2 = hp
2
x
i − hpxi
2
. (8.34)
(∆x)
2 and (∆px)
2 are the variance of position and momentum of a particle, respectively.
Note that only the mean values of x and x
2 are needed to compute ∆x. The uncertainty
principle always has members of a conjugate pair. The position-momentum uncertainty
relation was first called as indetermination principle by Arthur Edward Ruark [4] and then
as uncertainty principle by Edward Uhler Condon [5]. The Heisenberg relation was given
in the inequality form by Earle Hesse Kennard [6].
In momentum space p = ~k and hence the uncertainty relation is
(∆x)(∆k) ≥ 1/2 . (8.35)
From the equality sign we have ∆x = 1/(2∆k). This implies that if ∆x is small then ∆k
must be large and vice-versa. This accounts for the wave-particle paradox. We cannot make
∆x and ∆k small simultaneously (beyond the restriction ∆x∆k ≥ 1/2), that is, both a wave
and a particle. A similar condition we can have for the energy and time measurements:
(∆E)(∆t) ≥ ~/2 . (8.36)
For example, suppose we wish to measure the time t at which a particle arrives a particular
position with an uncertainty ∆t. As per the uncertainty principle, ∆E of the measured
energy of the particle at that position cannot be smaller than ~/(2∆t). Another result of
(8.36) is that a system, which is not in a steady state but changing with time, cannot have
a well-defined energy. The physical meaning of energy-time uncertainty is different from
that of x − px uncertainty. Position and momentum are observables to which Hermitian
operators are assigned and which are measured at a particular time. But time appears only
as a parameter in quantum theory as stated in sec. 3.8.3.
Solved Problem 1:
With an example show that the uncertainty principle is insignificant to larger objects or
particles and significant to microscopic particles.
Suppose a cricket ball of mass 300 gm is moving with a speed of 20 m per second. The error
in momentum measurement is, say, 0.1%. Then the uncertainty in the position measurement
is

2 × 0.3 × 20 ×
0.1
100
= 8.78667 × 10−33 m . (8.37)
∆x is of the order of 10−33 m. As this quantity is very small we cannot realize the uncertainty
principle. This is true for heavier bodies.210 Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
Next, consider an electron with velocity 2 × 107m. Let the uncertainty in its velocity
measurement be 0.1%. We obtain
∆x =

The size of the nucleus in any atom is ≈ 10−14 m. The calculated ∆x is very much greater
than the size of the nucleus and is thus matter in atomic scales.

For minimum uncertainty product, in the Schwarz inequality, the equal sign must hold. We
have the Schwarz inequality (refer Eq. (8.20))

2
. (8.44)
When Aψ˜ = zBψ˜ we get

Substituting Aψ˜ = zBψ˜ we get (z+z

8.5 Implications of Uncertainty Relation
The uncertainty relation has a wide-ranging significance2
. In the following we point out
some of them.
1. Suppose we wish to find the position and momentum of a moving particle. For
this purpose we allow light to fall on the particle. The particle will scatter part
of the incident light which will give details about the position of it. Note that the
position cannot be found more accurately than the wavelength of the incident
light. However, we can improve the accuracy using short wavelength wave. But
according to Planck’s hypothesis we need to use at least one quantum. This will
affect the particle and alter its momentum in a way that cannot be determined.
Further, to measure the position more precisely we have to use shorter wavelength
light. In such a case, energy of a single quantum (hc/λ) is higher and hence the
disturbance to the velocity of the particle will be large. Consequently, the more
accurately we attempt to measure the position, the less accurately we can measure
the speed and vice versa.
2. Consider the measurement of radius r0 of the electron orbit in a ground state of
the hydrogen atom. Theoretically predicted value of r0 is 5.3×10−11 m. According
to quantum mechanics this value is the most probable radius. This means in
experiment, most trials will give a different value, larger or smaller than 5.3 ×
10−11 m.
3. An important implication of the uncertainty principle is that quantum systems
do not follow classical trajectories which conflict with our everyday experience.
4. Another consequence is that quantum mechanical systems in their lowest energy
state (ground state) could not be at rest. For example, the electron of an atom
in its ground state could not be at rest. What will happen if it is at rest? In this
case its velocity is exactly known to be zero and its position would be known
precisely. This would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty relation.
5. Suppose ψ(x) is a delta-function at x = x0. The position of the particle is de￾termined exactly. What about the corresponding momentum wave function? The
momentum wave function C(k) is a sinusoidal function extending over all space.
Thus, the momentum uncertainty is infinity. Similarly, if ψ(x) is sinusoidal then
the position uncertainty is infinity whereas because the corresponding momentum
wave function is delta-function the uncertainty in momentum is zero.
6. It gives a resolution limit for the determination of the spectrum of a signal in
terms of the measurement [7]. It also states resolution limits for imaging systems
in terms of their aperture size. It serves as the basis of one of the standard measure
of laser beam quality [8]. The uncertainty principle indicates the existence of
quantum fluctuations in physical states that cannot be controlled completely.
Particularly, the fluctuations of energy and momentum go arbitrarily large when
the space-time interval becomes shorter and shorter.
7. The interaction between two particles occurs by means of exchange of a quan￾tum of the interacting field. For example, Yukawa’s strong nuclear force between
2Hans Bethe once said: Without the uncertainty principle there could not exist any atoms and there could
not be any certainty in the behaviour of matter whatever. It is really the certainty principle [I. Goodwin,
Physics Today, June 1995, pp.39].Illustration of Uncertainty Relation 213
nucleons is due to the exchange of pions. The mass of the exchanged quantum
is found to have an inverse relation with the range of the interaction. This can
be accounted only by the uncertainty relation. If R is the range and m is the
mass of the exchanged quantum then ∆t ≈ R/c and ∆E ≈ mc2
. The energy-time
uncertainty relation gives m ≈ ~/(2Rc). If R ≈ 10−15 m then m ≈ 200me, which
is roughly the mass of pions.
8. What prevents an electron from falling into nucleus? Suppose the electron was
assumed to be in the nucleus. In this case we exactly know its position. Then
according to uncertainty principle the momentum would be very large and hence
its energy would be very large. This large energy would then able to break away
the electron from the nucleus.
9. An important application of Heisenberg uncertainty pointed out by John Gribbin
is that in nuclear fusion reactions the quantum uncertainty allows atomic nuclei
that are not close enough to touch one another to overlap with one another to
combine. Some of such nuclear reactions keep the stars hot. That is, without
uncertainty principle the sun would not shine the way it does.
8.6 Illustration of Uncertainty Relation
Let us explain the uncertainty relation with two examples.
8.6.1 Gamma-Ray Microscope
We can measure the x-coordinate of an electron using a gamma-ray microscope by scattering
a photon off it. Here, to measure a position as accurate as possible, we need to use the light
of short wavelength. The accuracy in the measurement is given by
∆x = λ/(2 sin θ), (8.56)
where θ is the half-angle of the cone formed in Fig. 8.1 and λ is the wavelength of the
gamma-ray used.
In order to see the electron through the microscope the gamma-rays scattered by the
electron has to enter the objective of the microscope. In this process, the Compton effect
occurs, namely, a decrease in energy or increase in the wavelength of a photon happens. Let
λ represent the wavelength of the photon before interaction, and λ
′
is the wavelength of it
after interaction. In the process the electron undergoes a recoil and it can be set minimum
by using minimum gamma-ray energy. However, at least one gamma-ray photon need to be
used. In this case the scattered photon with momentum h/λ′ may enter the objective. If
its path is along PA then its momentum component along the direction of the incident ray
will be (h/λ′
) sin θ. The momentum that is transferred to the electron is
p1 =
h
λ
−
h

sin θ . (8.57)
In the case of the photon scattered along PB, the momentum given to the electron will be

8.6.2 Doppler Effect
The Doppler effect refers to the change in the frequency of waves noticed by a detector or
receiver due to the motion of the source of waves and the detector/observer. Let us consider
the problem of finding momentum of an electron using Doppler effect (Fig. 8.2). We have

′−ν) determines
the limitation on p. The details of the particle’s position will be lost due to the time interval
∆t needed to measure ν
′ − ν.
In the above considered process at least one photon must be scattered. After the scat￾tering the velocity of the electron is changed. We do not know at what exact instant during
∆t, the scattering took place. This results in an uncertainty in the velocity of the electron
and hence in its position.
Solved Problem 3:
Determine the uncertainty product for an electron passing through a diffraction grating of
infinite length.
Diffraction grating is a device used to produce spectra by diffraction. The well known grating
formula is d sin θ = nλ, where d is the spacing between grating lines, θ is the diffraction
angle of the diffracted maximum, n is the order of the spectral lines and λ is the wavelength
of the light. The above equation is the condition for diffraction to take place.
Let us consider the uncertainty in x-direction. After the diffraction we have d sin θ =
2nπ/kx. We do not know where the entrance of electron took place. Therefore, if the grating
has m slits each of width d then the uncertainty in the position coordinate along x-direction
is ∆x = md.
Initially the electrons are moving normal to x-axis and hence no component of the
momentum kx exists. When they are diffracted they have momentum component along kx￾direction. Then the uncertainty in kx component of momentum is ∆kx = (2π/d)∆n. Taking
∆n = 1/m we get ∆kx = 2π/∆x. That is, ∆x∆kx = 2π. Multiplying both sides by ~ we
obtain ∆x∆px = 2π~ > ~/2.

An electron of energy 300 eV is allowed to move through a circular aperture of radius

Uncertainty relations for two non-Hermitian operators corresponding to the two non￾commuting observables for weak measurements [12] and in the presence of quantum memory
have been developed [13–15]The Modified Heisenberg Relation 217
8.8 The Modified Heisenberg Relation
First, we show the need to modify the standard uncertainty relation, Eq. (8.28). In order to
hold the Heisenberg inequality, the state of a quantum system must possess certain criteria.
Before pointing out these restrictions let us verify the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for
the canonical pair Lz and φ.
8.8.1 What is (∆φ)(∆Lz)?
The components of orbital angular momentum L are (see sec. 11.3)
Lx = ypz − zpy = −i~

. (8.75c)
In spherical polar coordinates we have (see sec. 11.3 for details) Lz = −i~∂/∂φ. Lz and the
azimuthal angle φ form a canonical pair. It is easy to verify that [φ, Lz] = i~. From this
relation we expect ∆φ∆Lz ≥ ~/2. Let us find ∆φ∆Lz for the eigenstate
ψ(φ) = 1

Thus,
(∆φ)(∆Lz) = 0 <
~
2
. (8.79)
What went wrong? The reason is that eigenstates of Lz do not satisfy the criteria
required for the Heisenberg principle. Specifically, φ is not a proper dynamical variable
and hence does not represent a quantum mechanical operator. This is because φ converts
an acceptable eigenfunction ψ to an inadmissible one when it operates on ψ. When φ is
limited to the domain 0 to 2π then after it has increased to 2π, it jumps discontinuously
down to zero. Hence, φψ will also have a discontinuous jump after φ taking 2π. As φψ is
discontinuous, it is not physically acceptable. Therefore, φ is not a good operator and the
uncertainty relation between φ and Lz does not exist. In the following we describe these
criteria and show why ψ of Lz do not satisfy them.218 Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
8.8.2 Restrictions on States to Apply Standard Uncertainty Relation
For operators their domains are vital. The domain of an operator A is the set of all vectors
ψn in the Hilbert space (see sec. 6.9 for vector representation of ψ and the definition and
significance of Hilbert space) of the system so that Aψ is also a well defined member of
the Hilbert space. We denote the domain of A as D(A). To apply the uncertainty relation
(8.28) Aψ and Bψ must be defined in Hilbert space. There are reasons for a given ψ not in
D(A) [3]:
1. For the given ψ the prescription of the operator A is not defined.
2.
p
Aψ is not in the Hilbert space. Consider A = px = −i~d/dx and ψ(x) =
2|x| e
−|x|
. We have
Aψ = −i~
x
|x|
e
−|x|
p
2|x|
(1 − 2|x|). (8.80)
Observe that Aψ is undefined at x = 0 and so it is not in Hilbert space. In other
words, ψ is not in D(A).
3. In order to make A Hermitian its domain is restricted. Note that Lz is Hermitian
only if its D(Lz) is restricted to a set of functions ψ for which ψ(2π) = ψ(0) holds.
In fact, this is the source of the problem with the uncertainty relation between φ
and Lz [3].
8.8.3 Derivation of Modified Uncertainty Relation
Now, we present a brief derivation of modified uncertainty relation [3]. Let us define (∆A)
2
as
(∆A)
2 = h(A − hAi)ψ, (A − hAi)ψi = ||A − hAiψ||2
. (8.81)
This is for all the states in D(A). But the Eq. (8.28) is only for the states in D(A2
). For
two Hermitian operators A and B we have
σAB =
1
2
h(A − hAi)ψ, (B − hBi)ψi +
1
2
h(B − hBi)ψ, (A − hAi)ψi
= Reh(A − hAi)ψ, (B − hBi)ψi. (8.82)
This is satisfied for larger set of states in both D(A) and D(B). With A˜ = A − hAi,
Eqs. (8.81) and (8.82) become
∆A = ||Aψ˜ || , σAB = RehAψ, ˜ Bψ˜ i . (8.83)
The Schwarz inequality, Eq. (8.20), becomes
(∆A)(∆B) = ||Aψ˜ || ||Bψ˜ ||
≥ |hAψ, ˜ Bψ˜ i|
=
q
(RehAψ, ˜ Bψ˜ i)

AB + (ImhAψ, ˜ Bψ˜ i)
2
=
q
σ
2
AB + (ImhAψ, Bψi)
2 . (8.84)
This is the modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation and is guaranteed to valid in all cases
of well defined ∆A and σAB.Concluding Remarks 219
Interestingly, we recover (8.29) from Eq. (8.84). If ψ is in both D(AB) and D(BA) then

8.8.4 Modified Uncertainty Relation for the Pair (φ, Lz)
Note that Lz is Hermitian only if ψ(2π) = ψ(0). Observe that φψ(φ) = (1/
√
2π)φe
imφ is zero
at φ = 0 but nonzero at φ = 2π. Hence, (Lzφ)ψ not exists and therefore the commutator
inequality is not applicable. However, Eq. (8.84) is applicable. Let us find Imhφψ, Lzψi. We
obtain
Imhφψ, Lzψi = −

For the ψ given by Eq. (8.76), |ψ(2π)|
2
is 1/(2π). Substituting this in the above equation
yields Imhφψ, Lzψi = 0. Next, we ask: What is σφLz
for the ψ given by Eq. (8.76)? It is
easy to check that
σφLz = Rehφψ, Lzψi − hφihLzi = ~mπ − ~mπ = 0 . (8.88)
This is due to the fact that ψ is an eigenstate of Lz. With this the modified Heisenberg
uncertainty relation, Eq. (8.84), for φ and Lz is (∆φ)(∆Lz) ≥ 0.

8.9 Concluding Remarks
Generally, in the case of macroscopic systems the uncertainties associated with the outcomes
of measurements are small compared with the outcomes. As a result the perturbation c220 Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
be reduced as desired in considering joint measurements. In microsystems measurements
may lead to a large perturbation. Therefore, in the case of simultaneous measurements of
microscopic systems the perturbation may be very relevant. Essentially, one may assume
that in classical mechanics the observables are compatible and can be measured simulta￾neously. For microscopic systems there are certain incompatible observables and with the
same experimental set up they cannot be measured simultaneously.
The equation of motion of classical mechanics is a second-order differential equation
for each dependent variable. Determining each dynamical variable of a system needs two
integrations to be done and so two integration constants to be determined using, say, the
coordinates and conjugate momenta at t = t0 as initial conditions. Since the uncertainty
relation says that both of them cannot be determined simultaneously at t = t0, the trajec￾tory of the particles cannot be determined at least for microscopic particles for which ~ is
significant.
From this chapter note that quantum theory establishes a set of following rules:
1. It is impossible to make a measurement without disturbing the system.
2. Simultaneous measurement of a canonically conjugate pair of observables with
arbitrarily high accuracy is not possible.
3. We cannot draw pictures of individual quantum processes.
4. We cannot duplicate an unknown quantum state.
The above negative view points of quantum mechanics have recently been turned positive
and quantum cryptography is one of the best illustrations of this.

Momentum Representation
9.1 Introduction
In classical physics one needs to know the velocity or momentum of a particle in order
to determine its evolution. In quantum mechanics the wave function ψ already contains
information of possible momenta. What one has to do is to apply harmonic analysis to ψ.
Sometimes it is helpful to describe quantum states in terms of wave function of momentum.
This requires decomposition of ψ in terms of various momentum states and constructing a
new function C(k). The value of C(k) of each k gives the strength of the contribution to
the k−momentum state of ψ. The space of k is called momentum space.
One may ask: Where do we use momentum wave function? What is the form of
Schro¨dinger equation in momentum representation? What are the operator form of mo￾mentum p and coordinate X? These will be answered in the present chapter.
The position-space distribution is useful when we perform measurements of position of a
particle. Photo-cells and photographic plates are useful for position measurements for pho￾tons. The momentum representation is helpful in the case of measurement of momentum of a
particle. Recoil effects or Diffraction from a crystal are useful for momentum measurements.
The momentum space probability distribution P(k) = |C(k)|
2
is of increasing relevance as
related quantities are directly measurable in many fields of experimental physics. Examples
include:
1. Momentum distributions obtained from neutron scattering in solids and liquids.
2. Nuclear momentum distributions in nuclear scattering experiments.
3. Quark-gluon distributions in the proton necessary for understanding the high￾energy collisions in elementary particle physics.
9.2 Momentum Eigenfunctions
The eigenvalue equation of the operator pxop (in one-dimension) is
−i~
d
dx
φpx = px φpx
(x), (9.1)
where φpx
is the eigenfunction of pxop. The eigenvalue of pxop is denoted as px. Here onwards
in this chapter, we denote pxop as simply the operator p. The solution of Eq. (9.1) is
φp(x) = C e
ipx/~
, (9.2)
where C is a constant. Since p = ~k we write
φk(x) = C e
ikx
. (9.3)
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172178-9 223224 Momentum Representation
Therefore, φp is an eigenfunction of the momentum operator p with the eigenvalue ~k.
The possible momenta are ~k. It is easy to prove that the set of functions (9.3) with the
continuum values of k is an orthogonal set since

Solved Problem 1:
Determine the momentum wave function of a free particle.
The solution of a time-independent Schr¨odinger equation in coordinate space of a free
particle in one-dimension is given by Eq. (4.6). The superposition of these eigenfunctions is
given by
ψ(x) = Z ∞

What does C(k) represent? In Eq. (9.3), C(k) is the amplitude of the eigenfunction.
|ψ|
2dx gives the probability that a particle is being between x and x + dx. Similarly,
|C(k)|

this reason, C(k) is termed as the momentum wave function or wave function in momen￾tum space. It is the Fourier transform of ψ. If Eqs. (9.5) give ψ and C(k) at t = 0 then at

9.5 Transformation Between Momentum and
Coordinate Representations
We represent an electrical signal either in time domain or frequency domain. Like-wise
a quantum state is represented either in coordinate representation or in the momentum
representation.

i represents an eigenstate of the operator ˆx. Then ˆx|x

i = x

|x

i. These eigen￾functions obey the orthonormality condition hx

|xi = δ(x − x

i = x
′
hx|x
′
i = x

δ(x − x

vectors. When A operates on |βi, it gives, say, |αi in the same Hilbert space as |αi = A|βi.Operators in Momentum Representation 229
In coordinate representation ψα(X) = hX|αi and ψβ(X) = hX|βi. |αi = A|βi in terms of

9.8 Concluding Remarks
Though we so far considered only one-dimensional cases, the wave function in momen￾tum space for higher-dimensional systems has also been reported. For example, the wave
functions for hydrogen atom in the momentum representation [4,5] have obtained. The mo￾mentum representation is completely equivalent to the coordinate representation. In spite
of their complete equivalence, the momentum representation could throw much insight on
certain features that may remain hidden in the coordinate representation. For examples, the
SO(4) symmetry of the hydrogen atom was first uncovered by Fock [6] treating the prob￾lem in momentum representation. Further, the resonant Gamow states in the momentum
representation were found to be square-integrable solutions to a homogeneous Lippmann–
Schwinger equation. Generally, the position representation has been useful for most bound
state problems. With a few exceptions, the momentum representation has been used almost
exclusively to study scattering.
A method using delta function interactions has been introduced for constructing mo￾mentum wave function for hydrogen atom and hydrogen molecule ion [7]. Momentum space
is shown to be better suited for exploring electronic wave functions of quasiperiodic systems
[8].

Wave Packet
10.1 Introduction
A plane wave considered earlier in chapter 2, Eq. (2.1), extends over all space. This wave
has a single wave number k and is spread over all space. If we use this plane wave then
the particle may be found anywhere in space with equal probability. In this case ∆x = ∞
and ∆px = 0. However, particles are localized in space. If we want to associate a wave with
a particle in a consistent way, then the wave-like phenomenon should be localized in the
neighbourhood of the particle. That is, we wish to construct a localized wave with nonzero
amplitude in a small region of space and zero elsewhere. Such a description of a localized
particle can be achieved by constructing a wave packet.
To localize a free particle, we form a superposition of plane waves with various momenta.
Then ∆x and ∆px are finite. Because the particle is localized, the probability distribution
is confined to a finite region as P = ψ
∗ψ → 0 as |x| → ∞. It is possible to construct a
sufficiently narrow wave packet (superposition of number of waves of different frequencies)
which moves in such a way that the average position of the particle confirms classical laws.
Earlier, in chapter 4 we have noticed that the energy levels of linear harmonic oscillator are
equally spaced. It has a consequence on a wave packet. If we construct a wave packet for a
linear harmonic oscillator by suitably superposing its eigenstates then it will return to its
identical shapes at every classical period 2π/ω. This is because each state will have changed
phase by an integral number of 2π’s. Such states are called coherent states.
The behaviour of localized quantum wave packet has lately become an object of much
interest to forge a link between classical and quantum mechanics. We can consider the wave
packets synthesized by the superposition of a great many bound states centred around a
rather large mean value ¯n of the quantum number n. Such a wave packet may begin by
mimicking classical dynamics, but after a short while, quantum effects set in, causing, at
first a spreading and, at much later times, a partial or total restoration of the original form
at a point, which is not necessarily the same as that where the packet was initially localized.
In this chapter, we discuss some of the features of wave packets.
10.2 Phase and Group Velocities
Consider a plane wave u = ei(kx−ωt) of frequency ν = ω/(2π) and wavelength λ = 2π/k.
kx − ωt is called phase of the wave. The velocity of the wave is simply the velocity of a
point at which the phase is constant. Such a position is given by x = constant + (ω/k)t =
constant + vpt, where vp = ω/k is known as the phase velocity of the wave. Suppose we
superpose a large number of waves of the form u = ei(kx−ωt) and denote it as ψ(x, t). It is

given by

As this equation appears as the Fourier inverse transform we write
C(k) = 1
√
2π
Z ∞
−∞
ψ(x, t) e−i(kx−ωt) dx . (10.1b)
Although, t appears explicitly in the integral in Eq. (10.1b), C(k) does not depend on t
provided ψ is a superposition of plane waves. In this case ∂C(k)/∂t = 0:
Z ∞
−∞ 
∂ψ
∂t + iωψ
e
−i(kx−ωt) dx = 0 . (10.2)
The implication is ψ(x, t) can be replaced by ψ(x, 0) in Eqs. (10.1).
The wave function ψ(x, t) given by Eq. (10.1a) is called a wave group or a wave packet.
Its localizations in x and px (or k) can be adjustable and can be made very narrow. Wave
packet is often taken as the best approximation of quantum theory to a classical particle.
If the wave packet is regarded as a point, with zero amplitude everywhere except in a very
small region, then its motion can be interpreted as the motion of a single particle. Such a
wave packet is necessarily not stationary and spread (or shrink) in time.
When a wave travels without change of form then it is called a nondispersive wave. In
this case the connection between ω and k, called dispersion relation, is linear and the phase
velocity is same for each harmonic component of ψ. Suppose the connection between k and
ω is not linear. Because of the change of relative phase of the components in time the wave
packet cannot propagate without change of shape. The wave group will get dispersed and
die down in due course. It is a dispersive propagation. Dispersion can be avoided by limiting
the range of k.
Assume the simple case of major contribution to the integral in Eq. (10.1a) is coming
from groups of waves in a small neighbourhood of k = k0, (k0 −∆k) < k < (k0 +∆k). Then

velocity vp = ω/k, how does the wave group itself move? Does it move with the same ve￾locity vp or with a different velocity? In Eq. (10.4) x − ω

moves with a group velocity vg = dx/dt = ω

Equation (10.5) implies the following:
1. Group velocity of quantum wave function of a free particle is same as the velocity
of the classical free particle.
2. The kinetic energy and momentum are carried with the group velocity of the
quantum wave function.
Figure 10.1 shows the wave packet ψ at t = 0. In this figure real part of ψ (Eq. (10.4)) is
plotted where k0 = 5, ∆k = 2 and C(k0) = 1. The wave packet given by Eq. (10.4) is a
localized wave with its amplitude zero except in a small region of space. When more and
more waves are added the wave packet gets more and more narrower. In the limit of an
infinite number of waves covering all wavelengths, we can localize a particle to a single point
in space.

Many one-dimensional quantum mechanical systems have been studied based on a wave
packet approach. For example, transmission and reflection from a square-barrier [1–4] and238 Wave Packet
linear potential steps [5], bound state wave packets in a single square-well in position space
[6] and momentum space [7], double-wells [8,9] and systems relevance to solid state physics
[10,11], temperature effect on wave packet spreading [12] and wave packet motion using
expectation values [13] have been reported. The behaviour of Coulomb wave packets on
circular [14] and elliptical orbits [15] are tested experimentally on Rydberg atom systems
[16,17].
Study of wave packet is the subject of much current research in atomic, molecular,
chemical and condensed matter physics. They are well suited for studying the classical
limit of quantum mechanical systems. The advent of short-pulsed lasers made it possible
to produce and detect superposition of electron states for many physical systems. Such
superposition leads to the formation of localized electron wave packets.

10.3 Wave Packets and Uncertainty Principle
In quantum mechanics, a particle is described by a wave packet ψ(x, t). The wave packet
surrounds the position of the classical particle. The particle may be found anywhere within
the region with a probability density |ψ(x, t)|
2
. This implies that the position of the par￾ticle is indeterminate within the domain of the wave packet. A similar argument for the
momentum wave function φ(p, t) says that the momentum of the particle is also indetermi￾nate within the limits of φ(p, t). Since ψ(x, t) and φ(p, t) are related by Fourier transforms
the squaring of the wave packet in one domain will elongate in the other domain as space
domain and momentum domain have inverse relationship. If the wave packet is confined
to a small region in space and is highly localized then the spread of the wave packet in
momentum space become very large.
The uncertainties in position measurement ∆x and the momentum measurement ∆px
always satisfy the relation ∆x∆px ≥ ~/2. This Heisenberg uncertainty principle is indepen￾dent of the shape of the wave packet. To solve the equation of motion of a classical particle
we need to completely specify the initial values of position and momentum which means
∆x = ∆px = 0. But for a quantum mechanical particle it has been confirmed by experi￾ments that it is physically impossible to measure simultaneously position and momentum
of a particle with a higher degree of accuracy than the uncertainty relation allows. SinceWave Packets and Uncertainty Principle 239
the constant ~ is very small, for macroscopic objects, it becomes insignificant and hence
classical mechanics is fairly accurate. But for microscopic bodies, it is highly significant
and hence classical mechanics fails in describing systems like atoms, molecules, nucleus and
elementary particles.
The uncertainties ∆x and ∆px are given by ∆x = h(x − hxi)

10.4 Gaussian Wave Packet
In this section, we discuss the features of Gaussian wave packet.
10.4.1 Uncertainty Relation
A Gaussian minimum uncertainty wave packet is a superposition of plane waves localized
in position and momentum and with ∆x∆px = ~/2. This wave packet at t = 0 is given by
ψ(x, 0) = 

, (10.18)
where σ is a constant and it measures the width of the packet. It is a simple initial quantum
state. This wave packet is normalized. The probability of observing the particle decays to
zero very rapidly for |x − x0| >
√
2 σ. An interesting feature of the Gaussian wave packet is
that it has ∆x∆px = ~/2 at t = 0, a minimum uncertainty product. One can easily show
that (see the exercise 10.4 at the end of this chapter)

(10.19b)
and (∆x)(∆px) = ~/2. Hence, the Gaussian wave packet is a suitable candidate to represent
a particle. In this case the position and momentum can be determined simultaneously with
minimum uncertainty relation. If we make the Gaussian narrower and narrower in x by
reducing σ then ∆px grows, as 1/σ, in such a way that the product of ∆x and ∆px satisfies
the bound ~/2. It is of interest to know how a wave packet evolves in various physically
interesting quantum systems. This is explored in the rest of this section.
10.4.2 Construction of Gaussian Wave Packet for a System

d = vt = 2vmσ2/~ = 4πσ2/λ, where λ = h/(mv) = 2π~/(mv) is the de Broglie wavelength.
The wave packet essentially evolves by moving more or less classically according to its
central momentum px0 but spreading in position.

The mean position of the wave packet is x = x0 cos ωt. |ψ(x, t)|
2 oscillates harmonically
at the angular frequency 2ω with time. The wave packet is thus nonspreading and this is
a special feature of the harmonic oscillator. Figure 10.4 depicts |ψ|
2 as a function of time.
The expectation value of the wave packet satisfies the classical equation of motion, namely,
hx(t)i = x0 cos ωt and hpx(t)i = −mωx0−sin ωt. The position and momentum uncertainties
are given by ∆x = σx(t)/
√
2 and ∆px = σp(t)/
√
2. These uncertainties oscillate with a
period twice that of the classical motion regaining the initial values ∆x(0) and ∆px(0) at
two opposing points in phase space except when σ
2
0~/(mω) = 1. When σ
2~ = mω the widths
σx(t) and σp(t) are independent of time: σx(t) = σ0, σp(t) = ~/σ0. Further, ∆x∆px = ~/2,
the minimum uncertainty product. Such states are called coherent states.
Properties of two-dimensional Gaussian wave packets with fixed mean values of angular
momentum are studied with respect to two-dimensional harmonic isotropic oscillator [20].
For a discussion on Gaussian wave packet of a particle subjected to a constant force one
may refer to ref. [21].
A function oscillating faster than its fastest Fourier component is termed as a superoscil￾latory function [22–24]. The evolution of superoscillatory wavepackets in harmonic oscillator
has been reported [25]. For the Gaussian wave packet dynamics of a quantum bouncing ball
one may refer to the refs. [19,26].Wave Packet Revival 245

10.5 Wave Packet Revival
The localized wave packet solution disperses or spreads in time, however, at a later time,
it reforms and appears as its initial state. This is called wave packet revival. If the
probability density P(x, t) = |ψ(x, t)|
2 of a nonstationary state satisfies the condition
P(x, t0) = P(x, t0 + T ) for some finite T the wave packet is said to display exact revivals at
intervals of T .
1. Linear Harmonic Oscillator
Any wave packet ψ(x, t) can be expanded in terms of φn(x), the eigenfunctions of Hamil￾tonian H, as
ψ(x, t) = X
n
Cnφn(x) e−iEnt/~
, Cn =
Z ∞
−∞
φ
∗
n(x)ψ(x, 0) dx . (10.38)
For the linear harmonic oscillator, introducing the classical period T = 2π/ω we write the
above equation in the form
ψ(x, t) = e−iπt/T X∞
n=0
Cnφn(x) e−i2nπt/T
. (10.39)
There are two interesting results from Eq. (10.39):
(i) ψ(x, t + T ) = −ψ(x, t), (ii) ψ(x, t = T /2) = −iψ(−x, 0). (10.40)246 Wave Packet
From (10.40) we have
P(x, t + T ) = P(x, t), P(x, t = T /2) = P(−x, 0). (10.41)
This means that any wave packet |ψ(x, t)| for the linear harmonic oscillator is periodic with
period T and that the time T is the shortest interval after which a complete reconstruction
of the initial probability density is guaranteed (see Fig. 10.4). Similarly, the time t = T /2
is the first instant at which the probability density coincides with the mirror image of the
initial probability density (see Fig. 10.4). The wave packet is said to have exact revival at
t = T and a mirror revival at t = T /2.
2. Particle in a Box Potential
Referring to sec. 4.6 for a particle in a box potential Eq. (4.83) we can write the eigenfunc￾tions and energy eigenvalues separately for even partity and odd parity. For even parity

Suppose ψ(x, 0) is a normalized initial nonstationary wave function. ψ(x, 0) can be
expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions φn(x) as in Eq. (10.20) and ψ(x, t) is given by
Eq. (10.23). For even parity eigenfunctions we write En = (2n − 1)22π~/T , where T =
16ma2/(π~). Then
ψ(x, t) = XCnφen(x)e−i(2n−1)2
2πt/T
. (10.44)
It is desired to find the lowest t = t

for which ψ(x, t) ∝ βψ(x, 0) so that |ψ(x, t)|
2 =
|ψ(x, 0)|
2 and β
∗β = 1. Then exact revivals take place at intervals of t

. As ψ(x, 0) =
PCnφen(x) we find the lowest value of t for which e−i(2n−1)2
2πt/T = β with β
∗β = 1. The
values of (2n − 1)22πt/T for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . are 2πt/T , 18πt/T , 50πt/T , . . .. For t = T /8
this sequence becomes π/4, 2π + (π/4), 6π + (π/4), . . .. Then ψ(x, t = T /8) takes the form
ψ(x, t = T /8) = e−iπ/4XCnφen(x) = 1 − i
√
2
ψ(x, 0). (10.45)
This gives |ψ(x, T /8)|
2 = |ψ(x, 0)|
2
. The period of the wave packet is T /8. For odd parity
case the period of the wave packet is T /4.
Consider the even parity case. Assume the initial wave packet as the Gaussian form
given by Eq. (10.36) with k0 = 0, σ0 = 0.1 and x0 = 0. (Can we choose x0 6= 0?). In
Eq. (10.42) choose a = 1 units, ~ = 1 units and m = 1 units. In Eq. (10.38) the range
of the integration is [−1, 1] and it is difficult to obtain an analytical expression for Cn.
The integral in the expression for Cn can be numerically computed using, for example,
composite trapezoidal rule. Let us calculate Cn and ψ(x, t) numerically. Figure 10.5a shows
the variation of numerically computed Cn and P|Cn|
2 with n. Cn ≈ 0 for n > 10. The
quantity P|Cn|
2 approaches 1 with increase in n. The values of T and T /8 are 5.09296
and 0.63662, respectively. Figure 10.5b presents the time evolution of the initial Gaussian
wave packet. The shape of |ψ(x, t)|

been observed experimentally in a micromaser cavity with rubidium atom [29], in Rydberg
electron wave packet [30] and vibrational wave packets in Na2 [31]. The occurrence of wave
packet revivals has been studied in systems such as rigid rotator, weakly anharmonic poten￾tials, infinite square-well potential, circular billiards etc. [32–37]. An exact fractional wave
function revival is said to occur when the wave function of a particle become a superpo￾sition of translated initial wave functions. Fractional revivals have been observed in many
quantum systems such as Jaynes–Cummings model, Morse-like anharmonic potentials, Na2
etc. [38–45].
10.6 Almost Periodic Wave Packets
As seen earlier the Gaussian wave packet of a free particle, spreads in time while that of the
linear harmonic oscillator oscillates with time. Wave packet revival also occurs in certain
systems. There are a number of systems for which the time-dependent wave function does
not spread in time. The occurrence of nonspreading wave function is found in certain one￾dimensional system having discrete energy eigenvalues En [45]. The wave function of such
systems exhibit almost periodic behaviour in time t. For a periodic function f(t) with period
τ we write f(t + τ) = f(t). By almost periodic function we mean that there is no values of
τ strictly satisfying f(t + τ) = f(t), however, there are infinite number of τn, n = 1, 2, . . . ,
so that f(t + τn) ≈ f(t) is satisfied.Concluding Remarks 249
Suppose for a particle in a one-dimensional confined potential the stationary state dis￾crete nondegenerate eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions are En and φn, respectively. Then
the general time-dependent wave function is written as in Eq. (10.23) with Cn given by
Eq. (10.22). It is easy to show that the wave function given by Eq. (10.23) is almost pe￾riodic in t [45]. Let the allowed tolerance in f is ǫ, that is |f(t + τn) − f(t)| < ǫ. Almost
periodic functions is viewed as a generalization of periodic functions since any almost pe￾riodic function is written as f(t) = P
n Ane
iωnt
, where An are real or complex while ωn
are real. For a strictly periodic function ωn = nω1. According to the Riesz–Fischer theorem
[
P
46] a trigonometric series is the Fourier series of an almost periodic function as long as
n
|An|
2
converges. Applying this theorem to Eq. (10.23) we say that ψ(x, t) is almost
periodic in t provided P|Cn|
2
|φn|
2
converges. We require

2 = |φm(x)|
2
, (10.47)
where |φm(x)| is the largest of all of the φn(x) for the particular value of x. Hence, for a
discrete energy eigenvalue spectrum ψ(x, t) is an almost periodic function of time t.
For a linear harmonic oscillator En = (n + 1/2)~ω. Writing Ψ(x, t) = eiωt/2ψ(x, t)
Eq. (10.23) becomes
Ψ(x, t) = X∞
n=0
Cne
−inωtφn(x) (10.48)
which is a Fourier series in t and is a periodic function of t. The strictly periodic behaviour
of Ψ is due to the fact that En are equally spaced. For a discussion on fluid-like properties of
probability density, interpretation of them for the one-dimensional Gaussian wave packet,
stationary states of a particle in a box and hydrogen atom see refs. [47,48].
10.7 Concluding Remarks
Suppose one shines a femtosecond optical pulse on a diatomic molecule that has enough
broad bandwidth to cover several vibrational levels in the excited state. Then it is possible
to create a nuclear wave packet that is spatially localized and no longer stationary. The
wave packet thus created is a linear combination of several eigenstates.
Laser pump-probe techniques in the femtosecond time domain have been applied to
temporarily resolve the motion of vibrational wave packet molecules and study the femto￾chemistry of the transition state of several gas-phase reactions. It has been demonstrated
that a wave packet, the coherent superposition of a set of vibrational eigenstates produced
by an optical pulse the duration of which is short compared to the vibrational period, can
be observed by detecting the molecular species itself as a dissociation product by fluores￾cence spectroscopy [49]. Since the temporal history of the wave packet bears the signature
of the potential well in which it moves, the study on wave packet dynamics has been used
to find the potential energy surface of diatomic molecules. All spectral information can be
recovered by studying the temporal evolution of a wave packet.
Technological advances led to a significant amount of research being focused at inves￾tigating the time-dependent behaviour of electron wave packets. The ultimate theme is to
generate wave packets that control electronic process in atoms and molecules. Several con￾trol schemes exist which use light to drive atoms or molecules along prescribed pathways.
They exploit the coherence of laser light to manipulate the quantum phase relationships
between various eigenstates of the system [50].250 Wave Packet

Theory of Angular Momentum
11.1 Introduction
A particle moving along a straight-line has a linear momentum mv. A revolving particle
has angular momentum due to its mass and angular velocity. In classical mechanics, orbital
angular momentum is the vector product of position (r) and linear momentum (p):
L = r × p . (11.1)
Let us imagine the electron as a small ball, revolving about some axis. It possesses angular
momentum. Precisely, the angular momentum vector is a vector pointing along the axis
of rotation with magnitude proportional to the speed of rotation. A vector which changes
sign under space inversion (parity operation) is called a polar vector . r and p are polar
vectors as they change sign. Since L = (−r) × (−p), L does not change sign under parity
operation. Such vectors which do not change sign under parity operation are called axial
vectors or psuedo-vectors. Classically, the angular momentum of the electron could have any
magnitude. In quantum mechanics the orbital angular momentum operator is obtained by
replacing p by −i~∇. The angular position of a particle is the angle at which it is located
in two-dimensional polar coordinates.
Why should one study about angular momentum? Let us point out some significances of
angular momentum. Comet tails always point away from the sun because light carries linear
momentum. In 1921 Einstein has shown that Planck’s black body law and the motion of
molecules in a radiation fields could be explained if the linear momentum of a photon is ~k.
In 1909 John Poynting noticed that polarized light has angular momentum − spin angular
momentum associated with circular polarization. For a single photon it has a value of ±~.
Gibson et al. [1] pioneered the use of orbital angular momentum to encode information
in free-space optical communication. Just like an intensity that is switched on or off can
represent a value of zero or one (a bit), so different phase-front twists can represent different
values. There are infinitely many different twists, and as a single photon can have these
twists, photons can carry arbitrary amounts of information. Orbital angular momentum of
light beams can be used for super-high density optical data storage [2].
Angular momentum has practical applications in the study of atomic transitions, wireless
communication [3,4], quantum experiments [5], electromagnetic vortex image processing [6],
nanotechnology [7], radio and congestion [8], holography [9] a few to mention. It has been
realized that angular momentum could be carried by light beams with an azimuthal phase
dependence [10]. Such light beams are realizable.
For a particle rotating in a two-dimensional plane, we can choose the z-axis as the axis
of rotation if the plane of rotation is the xy-plane. In this case Lx = Ly = 0 and Lz = L.
For a central force problem, the force F acts in the direction of r. Hence, the torque is
N = dL/dt = 0. Therefore, L is conserved in all central force problems. Since the potential
is a spherically symmetric for the central force problem V (r) depends only on the magnitude
of r. Because L is conserved classically for a central force, the motion takes place in a plane
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172178-11 253254 Theory of Angular Momentum
with L perpendicular to the plane. When the particle rotates in a three-dimensional space,
the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the plane of rotation. However, the axis is free to
take any direction and L

11.2 Scalar Wave Function Under Rotations
A rotation of r by an angle θ about an axis of unit vector n changes r to r
′
. If the rotation
operation in physical space is represented by R(n, θ), then r
′ = R(n, θ)r. For example, if
the z-axis is chosen as the rotation axis then we find
R(k, θ) =


cos θ − sin θ 0
sin θ cos θ 0
0 0 1

 . (11.2)
Since rotation does not change the magnitude of the vector we have r
′
· r
′ = r · r. Hence,
RRT = RT R = I. The rotation matrix R is orthogonal. R(n, θ) gives the transformation
matrix in physical space. We need to find the effect of such rotation in a wave function.
As the wave function represents a vector in Hilbert space, the rotational transformation in
physical space will lead to a unitary transformation UR(n, θ) in Hilbert space.
11.2.1 The Transformation Operator
Under a rotation through θ about n, ψ(r) → ψ
′
(r
′
) = ψ
′
(x
′
, y′
, z′
), where ψ
′
is the rotated
function. We know that a rotated scalar function evaluated at the rotated point must be
the same as the unrotated scalar function evaluated at the original point. In view of this
because ψ is a scalar we have ψ
′
(r
′
) = ψ(r). The value of ψ(r) cannot change under rotation
of the coordinate system even though our point of viewing is changed. From r
′ = R(n, θ)r
we write r = R(n, −θ)r
′ by which ψ(r
′
) = ψ(R(n, −θ)r
′
). Dropping the prime on r
′
, we get
ψ
′
(r) = ψ(R(n, −θ)r). That is, the rotated wave function evaluated at r is the same as the
unrotated function evaluated at the point R(n, −θ)r.
If the transformation of ψ
′
(r) and ψ(r) is given by the operator UR(n, θ) then
URψ(r) = ψ
′
(r) = ψ(R(n, −θ)r). (11.3)
An expression for UR(n, θ) is obtained by choosing n along the z-axis and letting θ to be a
first-order infinitesimal rotation angle ∆θ. With the choice n = k and θ → ∆θz, we obtain
from Eq. (11.2)
R(k, −∆θz)r ≈


x + ∆θzy
y − ∆θzx
z

 . (11.4)
Hence, Eq. (11.3) becomes
UR(k, ∆θz)ψ(r) ≈ ψ(x + ∆θzy, y − ∆θzx, z). (11.5)
Using the Taylor series expansion
ψ(x + ∆θzy, y − ∆θzx, z) ≈

For a spinless particle, the infinitesimal generators of rotations about the z-axis is simply
Lz. Generalizing Eq. (11.7) for an infinitesimal rotation ∆θ in the direction n, we get
UR(n, ∆θ) ≈ I −
i
~
∆θ n · L. (11.8)
Suppose it is desired to find UR(n, θ) for some finite rotation θ. The effect of a small
increase in the magnitude of θ from θ to θ + ∆θ is to follow the finite rotation UR(n, θ) by
the infinitesimal rotation I − (i/~)∆θn · L to give

(r) = e−iθn·L/~ψ(r). (11.11)
11.2.2 Symmetry Groups
In classical mechanics the symmetry of a physical system leads to conservation laws. If the
space is isotropic, it possesses rotational symmetry. Consequently, the angular momentum
for such a system is conserved. Similarly, the homogeneity of space leads to translational
symmetry and it conserves the linear momentum of the system. Invariance of a system
under some symmetry operations results in some conservation laws and consequently we
have a vast simplification of the mathematical theories of such systems. Associated with
every symmetry is a mathematical object known as a symmetry group and the set of all the
symmetry operations of a system satisfies the postulates of a group1
[11].
11.2.3 Lie Groups
The number of elements in a group is called its order . A group with finite number of elements
is called a finite group whereas an infinite group contains infinite number of elements.
An infinite group may further be either discrete or continuous. For example, a group of
all integers including zero form a discrete infinite group under algebraic addition. If we
consider a group of all real numbers x ∈ [−∞, ∞], they form an infinite continuous group
under algebraic addition.
The elements of a continuous group is characterized by a set of real, continuous, differ￾entiable parameters (α1, α2, . . . , αr). If r is finite then the group is said to be finite and r is
called the order of the continuous group. For example, the two-dimensional rotation matrix
R(k, θ) = 
cos θ − sin θ
sin θ cos θ

(11.12)
1Group theory is the mathematical tool to treat invariants and symmetries.256 Theory of Angular Momentum
forms a one-parameter infinite continuous group as θ can vary continuously between 0 to
2π. A continuously connected group in which the parameters of the product of two elements
are continuous and differentiable functions of the parameters of the elements is called a Lie
group.
The dependence of the elements X1, X2, . . . of a Lie group on its r continuous parameters
is written as
Xi = Xi (α1, α2, . . . , αr) , i = 1, 2, . . . . (11.13)
It is convenient to choose the Cartesian parameters of a Lie group such that the image of
the identity element is I = X(0, 0, . . . , 0). With this parametrization an element near the
identity is written, due to the analytical properties of the Lie groups as
X(0, 0, . . . , ǫj, . . . , 0) ≈ X(0, 0, . . . , 0) + iǫjTj (0, 0, . . . , 0) (11.14)
to first-order in ǫj . The operator Tj obtained from (11.14) is given by
Tj = lim
ǫj→0

iǫj
[X(0, . . . , ǫj , . . . , 0) − X(0, . . . , 0)] = 1
i
∂X
∂ǫj
. (11.15)
Tj are called the generators of the group. If we write αj = N ǫj, where N is a large posi￾tive integer so that ǫj is a small quantity, then the element for any finite variation of the
parameter αj is obtained from (11.13) as
X (0, 0, . . . , αj , . . . , 0) = lim
N→∞
[X(0, 0, . . . , ǫj, 0, . . . , 0)]N
= lim
N→∞ 
1 + i
αjTj
N
N
= eiαjTj
. (11.16)
We extend the above result to obtain
X (α1, α2, . . . , αr) = exp


Xr
j=1
iαjTj

 . (11.17)
If Tj are known then all the elements of the Lie group corresponding to various αj values are
found using Eq. (11.17). Hence, Tj are called the generators of the Lie group. We can prove
that these generators of a group are linearly independent. Hence, they are not unique for a
group. Any set of r-linear combination of these generators Tj can also be used as generators
of the group. Since eiαkTk and eiαlTl are two elements of the group, their product must also
belong to the group. Therefore, the multiplication of two group elements will be given by
the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula [12]

. (11.18)
Therefore, it is clear that once the commutators of the generators are known, it is possible
to evaluate the multiplication of any pair of group elements and the commutators must be
a linear combination of the generators Tj. We write [Tk, Tl
] = P
j
fkljTj, where fklj are
called the structure constants of the group. Since [Tk, Tl
] = −[Tl
, Tk] we set fklj = −flkj .
The group elements follow associative law of combination and the generators satisfy the
Jacobi identity
[Tk, [Tl
, Tm]] + [Tl
, [Tm, Tk]] + [Tm, [Tk, Tl
]] = 0 . (11.19)
Moreover, we can prove that if the generators are Hermitian then the structure constants
are purely imaginary.Orbital Angular Momentum 257
11.3 Orbital Angular Momentum
In three-dimension with r = ix + jy + kz and p = ipx + jpy + kpz we write L = r × p as
L = iLx + jLy + kLz, where
Lx = ypz − zpy, Ly = zpx − xpz, Lz = xpy − ypx . (11.20)
The above are the classical components of L. The quantum mechanical operators Lx, Ly
and Lz are obtained from Eq. (11.20) by replacing the variables by their corresponding
operators. We obtain

In general

Is the operator L a Hermitian? The operators x, y, z, −i~∂/∂x, −i~∂/∂y and −i~∂/∂z
are Hermitian. Product of two operators is Hermitian only if their commutator bracket
vanishes. Consider the operator Lx. Since y and pz, z and py are commuting operators
their product is also a Hermitian. Hence Lx is Hermitian. Similarly, Ly and Lz are also
Hermitian. Consequently, L is a Hermitian operator as well as L
2
. Hence, L and L
2 are
observables.

The components of L and L

commute with r and ∂/∂r. Lz commutes with any operator
and with ∇2 and with any spherically symmetric Hamiltonian, H, that is [L, H] = 0 and
[L
2
, H] = 0. This implies that (i) an eigenfunction of a spherically symmetric H is also an
eigenfunction of Lx or Ly or Lz or of any linear combination of these operators and (ii) the
law of conservation of angular momentum holds in both quantum and classical mechanics.
Usually, only one of the three Cartesian components of angular momentum is specified
in a quantum mechanical state. The remaining two are determined from the known third.
Generally, the z-component of L is specified due to the simplicity of its operator form.

The eigenvalues of L
2 are λ~
2 = l(l + 1)~
2
. As L
2 and Lz are commuting operators they
have same set of eigenfunctions. Ylm are the eigenfunctions of L
2
. Therefore, Ylm are the
eigenfunctions of Lz also. Now, from the eigenvalue equation of Lz, LzYlm = −i~∂Ylm/∂φ
we obtain LzYlm = m~Ylm.
To summarize,

LzYlm(θ, φ) = m~Ylm(θ, φ), m = l, l − 1, . . . , −l. (11.32b)
The observation is that angular momentum is quantized. The eigenvalues of L = |L| =
√
L2
are discrete, quantized. L can assume only one of the discrete set of values, p
l(l + 1)~,
l = 0, 1, 2, . . . . (Here l measures the magnitude of L.) But as noted in sec. 1.4 the Bohr’s
prediction is L = n~. The point is that we have to discard the planetary model of electrons
moving about a nucleus. The angle φ is a measure of the rotation about the z-axis. The
z-component of angular momentum Lz has eigenvalues m~. Since m takes only integer
values we say that only certain orientations of L alone are possible. This is called space
quantization in vector atom model2
. Figure 11.1 shows orientation of L for l = 2.
11.3.3 Properties of Components of L and L2
In the following we present some of the useful properties of the components of L and L
2
.
2When an atom is placed in a magnetic field applied along z-axis, the energy of the atom is changed by
an amount proportional to the z-component of its magnetic moment. This change is related to Lz. For this
reason m is called the magnetic quantum number.260 Theory of Angular Momentum
11.3.3.1 Commutation Relations
It is easy to show that
[Lx, x] = 0, [Lx, y] = i~z, [Lx, z] = −i~y , (11.33a)
[Lx, px] = 0, [Lx, py] = i~pz, [Lx, pz] = −i~py , (11.33b)

L

, Lz

We prove a few of the above results. Let us calculate [Lx, Ly]. We obtain
[Lx, Ly] = [ypz − zpy, zpx − xpz]
= [ypz, zpx] − [ypz, xpz] − [zpy, zpx] + [zpy, xpz]
= ypz(zpx) − zpx(ypz) − ypz(xpz) + xpz(ypz)
−zpy(zpx) + zpx(zpy) + zpy(xpz) − xpz(zpy)
= −i~ypx + yzpzpx − yzpxpz − xypzpz + xypzpz

pypx + z

pxpy + zxpypz + i~xpy − xzpzpy

= Lx [Lx, Lz] + [Lx, Lz]Lx + Ly [Ly, Lz] + [Ly, Lz]Ly
= −i~LxLy − i~LyLx + i~LyLx + i~LxLy
= 0 . (11.36)
The nonzero values of [Lx, Ly], [Ly, Lz] and [Lz, Lx] imply that Lx, Ly and Lz cannot
be measured simultaneously with desired accuracy, that is, we cannot simultaneously have
definite values of Lx, Ly and Lz. The operator L
2
commutes with every component of L.
However, the components of L are not commuting operators. Hence, it is impossible to form
a simultaneous eigenfunction of two different components of L.
11.3.3.2 What is the Significance of [L
2
, Lz] = 0?
In order to understand the significance of the relation [L
2
, Lz] = 0 consider L
2 and Lz.
What is the condition for ψ to be a simultaneous eigenfunction of L
2 and Lz? If ψ is an
eigenfunction of L
2 and Lz with eigenvalues λ and λ
′
, respectively, then
L
2ψ = λψ , (11.37a)
Lzψ = λ
′ψ . (11.37b)
Operating −Lz from left on Eq. (11.37a) we have
−LzL
2ψ = −λλ′ψ . (11.38a)Orbital Angular Momentum 261
Operating L
2
from left on Eq. (11.37b) we get
L
2Lzψ = λλ′ψ . (11.38b)
Adding Eqs. (11.38a) and (11.38b) we obtain
L
2Lzψ − LzL
2ψ = [L
2
, Lz]ψ = 0. (11.39)
That is, [L
2
, Lz] = 0. Thus, the above relation implies that if ψ is an eigenfunction of L
2
then it is an eigenfunction of Lz also and vice-verse. Further, L
2 and Lz can be measured
simultaneously.
11.3.3.3 Ladder Operators L±
Earlier we defined the ladder operators L± as (Lx ± iLy). Then
[Lz, L±] = [Lz, Lx] ± i [Lz, Ly]
= i~Ly ± ~Lx
= ±~ (Lx ± iLy)
= ±~L± . (11.40)
Solved Problem 1:
Find the effect of L± on ψ.
Consider Lz(L±ψ). We obtain
Lz (L±ψ) = (LzL±) ψ
= (LzL± − L±Lz + L±Lz) ψ
= ([Lz, L±] + L±Lz) ψ
= (±~L± + L±Lz) ψ
= (±~L± + m~L±) ψ
= (m ± 1) ~L±ψ . (11.41)
Notice that L±ψ is an eigenfunction of Lz. We know that the effect of Lz on ψ is to yield
the eigenvalues m~. When L± is also operated then the eigenvalue is changed to (m ± 1)~
as seen from Eq. (11.41). Thus, the effect of L± is to change the eigenvalue by ±~. L+
increases the eigenvalue by +~ while L− decreases the eigenvalue by −~. That is, L+ (L−)
increases (decreases) z-component of the angular momentum by one unit of ~.
11.3.3.4 Expectation Values
Because of the symmetry properties of ψnlm in angular coordinates, we obtain
hLx,yilm = (ψnlm, Lx,yψnlm) = (Ylm, Lx,yYlm) = 0 . (11.42)

which means the uncertainty in Lx is zero. Similarly, for Ly also the uncertainty is zero.
But they are noncommuting operators. Therefore, the uncertainty relation is (∆Lx)(∆Ly) ≥
~/2. Hence, hL

11.3.4 Eigenspectra Through Commutation Relations
In sec. 11.3.2 we obtained the eigenvalues of L
2 and Lz by solving their eigenvalue equations
which are differential equations. We now determine the eigenvalues of L
2 and Lz using
commutation relations together with the ladder operators L±. The procedure is similar to
the method which we used in sec. 4.4 for linear harmonic oscillator.Orbital Angular Momentum 263
11.3.4.1 Determination of Eigenvalues
Let ψlm denote the state vector belonging to the eigenvalues λl~
2 of L
2 and m~ of Lz. (This
state can be represented as |l, mi or |lmi.) Then
Lzψlm = m~ψlm, L
2ψlm = λl~
2ψlm . (11.52)
Introduce a function φ
±
lm through the equation L±ψlm = φ
±
lm. Since the effect of L± on
ψlm is to change the eigenvalue by ±~ the function φ
±
lm is proportional to ψlm±1. That is,
φ
±
lm = N±~ψlm±1, where N± is a constant to be determined.
We denote the minimum of the eigenvalue as mmin and the maximum as mmax. We
determine their values. If L+ is operated on ψlmmax
then the eigenvalue must be mmax + 1
which is not possible. Thus, L+ψlmmax = 0. Similarly, L−ψlmmin = 0. Now, consider
L− (L+ψlmmax ) = 0 . (11.53)
Expanding the left-side of Eq. (11.53) we get
0 = (Lx − iLy) (Lx + iLy) ψlmmax

ψlmmax

￾
λl − m2

ψlmmax
. (11.54)
The above equation gives
λl − mmax (mmax + 1) = 0 . (11.55)
Similarly, from L+(L−ψlmmin ) = 0 we have
λl − mmin (mmin − 1) = 0 . (11.56)
Comparison of Eqs. (11.55) and (11.56) gives m2
min − mmin = m2
max + mmax or
(mmax + mmin) (mmax − mmin + 1) = 0 . (11.57)
From Eq. (11.57), mmax is −mmin or mmax = mmin − 1. Because mmax is the maximum
value it cannot be mmin−1. Therefore, we choose mmax = −mmin. Since the values of m are
integers the number mmax − mmin must be an integer and we denote it as 2l. The possible
values of m are m = l, l − 1, . . . , −l + 1, −l. Then the possible values of l are 0, 1/2, 1, . . ..
Substitution of mmax = −mmin in the expression mmax−mmin = 2l gives mmax = l. Further,
from Eq. (11.55) λl
is obtained as
λl = mmax (mmax + 1) = l(l + 1). (11.58)
Next, we determine N±. Using Eq. (11.50), we write

11.3.4.2 Properties of Eigenvalues
From (11.61b) we state the following features of eigenvalue spectra of L
2
:
1. The eigenvalues of L
2 are = ( 6 l~)
2 but = l(l + 1)~
2 and are greater than (l~)
2
.
The reason for this is as follows [14]. For a state ψlm we have hL
2
i = λ~
2 and
hL
2
z
i = m2~
2
. Then
hL
2
i = hL
2
x
i + hL
2
y
i + hL
2
z
i (11.62)
which gives
λ~
2 = hL
2
x
i + hL
2
y
i + (m~)
2
. (11.63)
The expectation values of L
2
x and L
2
y are nonnegative. This means λ ≥ m2
. If
we want to have a state with some positive value of l for m then λ ≥ l
2
. The
eigenvalues of L
2 are ≥ (l~)
2
. To have equality sign we must have hL
2
x
i = hL
2
y
i = 0.
If the projection of the angular momentum on the z-axis were the same length
as the angular momentum vector then the projections on the x and y axes would
be zero. This violates the uncertainty relation. This is because the components
of angular momentum do not commute with each other as seen earlier. Thus, the
eigenvalue of L
2 > (l~)
2
.
2. For a given l the m can take (2l + 1) distinct values. Therefore, eigenvalues of L
2
are (2l + 1)-fold degenerate.
3. What is the fundamental difference between the states with integer and half-integer
values of l? Consider the equation e−iθLz ψlm = e−imθψlm. For integer values of
l the states ψlm will not change under a rotation through θ = 2π and are single￾valued. But the states will change sign for half-integer angular momentum and
are hence double-valued under rotation.
Next, consider the ψlm given by

Therefore, the functions (11.64) corresponding to half-integer values of l are not

2 are obtained by solving
the eigenvalue Eq. (11.30). In this case the eigenvalues are l(l + 1)~

, where l
is a nonnegative integer, l = 0, 1, 2, . . .. In contrast to this, when the commu￾tation relations are alone used as above, the eigenvalues are l(l + 1)~
2
, where
l = 0, 1/2, 1, . . .. In addition to integer l, half-integer values also exist, however,
they do not correspond to orbital angular momentum. In working with the com￾mutation relations instead of the quantum number l suppose we use a different
quantum number j. Then the eigenvalues are j(j + 1)~, where j = 0, 1/2, 1, . . ..
These j quantum numbers will be representing the total angular momentum
J = L + S, where S is spin angular momentum.

11.3.5 Matrix Representation of L2
, Lz and L±
Suppose the wave function ψ is a vector. For example, ψ of an atom is complex and we can
treat it as a two-component vector function. If ψ is regarded as a vector then the operator
acting on it must be represented in matrix form. For illustrative purpose consider f(x) and
g(x) such that Af(x) = g(x). Since the wave function has the completeness property, we
write
f(x) = X
m
amψm , g(x) = X
n
bnψn . (11.69)
Then Af(x) = g(x) is rewritten as P
m amAψm =

11.4 Spin Angular Momentum
So far, we have not introduced the term spin in quantum mechanics. In this section, first the
notion of spin [15] is introduced and a few examples of necessity of spin angular momentum
are mentioned. Then spin states of an electron are obtained. The spin-orbit interaction is
brought out.
11.4.1 Physical Picture of Spin [15]
Soon after Bohr came up with his atom model, it was assumed that the electron revolving
around the nucleus was also spinning about an axis. Later, it was realized that this assump￾tion had no validity. Spin of particle is not a measure of how it is spinning. In fact, it is
impossible to tell whether an electron is spinning. The word spin is a convenient way of
representing the intrinsic angular momentum of a particle.
The spin is said to be a nonorbital, intrinsic or inherent angular momentum. Also, spin
is thought of as due to an internal structure of the electron. Further, the spin arises in a
natural way from Dirac equation. We can regard spin as due to a circulating flow of energy
or a momentum density, in the electron wave field. This picture of spin is valid not only
for electrons, but also for photons, vector mesons and gravitons. In all these cases the spin
angular momentum is due to a circulating energy flow in the fields.
The spin of the electron has a close classical analog. It is an angular momentum of the
same kind as possessed by the fields of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave. Gordon
showed that the magnetic moment of the electron is due to the circulating flow of charge in
the electron wave field. This means that spin and the magnetic moment are not due to the
internal properties of the electron but with the structure of its wave field.Spin Angular Momentum 267

’s are Pauli matrices and αi
’s
are Dirac matrices (see sec. 19.3.1). The first term in G is associated with the translational
motion of the electron. The second term is associated with circulating flow of energy. For a

The flow lines for the energy are circular. Such a circulating flow of energy will give an
angular momentum and is the spin. For historical continuity this property was called spin
and not means that the electron is spinning. For an arbitrary wave packet, the net angular
momentum is

hσi
= L + S . (11.82)
The first term is the orbital angular momentum, and the second term is the spin S. The
first term is independent of the spin-orbital state. The second term is dependent on the
spin-orbital state. Because the spin S given by Eq. (11.82) is the expectation value of σ,
the operator representing the spin must be
Sop =
~
2
σ . (11.83)
Thus, the spin operator obeys all the usual commutation relations. In particular, the eigen￾values of any component of the spin, say z-component, are ±~/2 (or ±1/2 in units of ~).
Whatever we have said in the earlier sections of the present chapter for orbital angular
momentum L is also true for spin angular momentum and also true for the total angular
momentum J = L + S.268 Theory of Angular Momentum

The eigenvalues of Sx, Sy, Sz and S
2 are ±~/2, ±~/2, ±~/2 and 3~
2/4, respectively.
The components of S satisfy orbital angular momentum type commutation relations:
[Sx, Sy] = i~Sz , [Sy, Sz] = i~Sx , [Sz, Sx] = i~Sy . (11.86)
Verify that
S+|αi = 0 , S−|αi = ~|βi, S+|βi = ~|αi, S−|βi = 0 , (11.87)
where |αi and |βi are the eigenkets of Sz with eigenvalues ~/2 and −~/2, respectively. Using
the above relations it is easy to prove that
σx|αi = |βi, σx|βi = |αi, σy|αi = i|βi, (11.88a)
σy|βi = −i|αi, σz|αi = |αi, σz|βi = −|βi. (11.88b)
Because Sx = (S+ + S−)/2 we obtain
Sx|αi =

(S+ + S−)|αi =

(S+|αi + S−|αi) = ~

Similarly, we obtain
Sy|αi =
~
2
|βi, Sy|βi = −

|αi. (11.89c)
Using the relation σx = (2/~)Sx we get
σx|αi =

~
Sx|αi = |βi, σx|βi = |αi. (11.90a)
In a similar manner we get
σy|αi = i|βi, σy|βi = −i|αi, (11.90b)
σz|αi = |αi , σz|βi = −|βi. (11.90c)Spin Angular Momentum 269
11.4.3 Normalized Eigenfunctions of σx, σy and σz
We obtain the normalized eigenfunctions of σx, σy and σz. Since σx|αi = |βi, σx|βi = |αi
we have
σx (|αi ± |βi) = ±|αi + |βi. (11.91)
Similarly, from Eqs. (11.90b) we obtain
σy (|αi ± i|βi) = ±|αi + i|βi. (11.92)
The normalization gives the factor 1/

11.4.4 Examples of Necessity of Spin Angular Momentum
Without spin the quantum theory cannot explain many observed phenomena. Some
examples are given below:
1. The energy levels of hydrogen atom are given by Eq. (12.35). Since En depends
only on n and independent of l and m we say that the energy levels are degenerate
with respect to l and m. The number of degeneracy is 2n
2
(see Eq. (12.65)). To
distinguish these states we use spin angular momentum.
2. The magnetic dipole moments and susceptibility of ferromagnets are explained
with spin angular momentum.
3. The D-lines of sodium obtained at 5890 ˚A and 5896 ˚A show the existence of fine
structure and is explained using spin.
4. A beam of atoms passing through an inhomogeneous magnetic field should split
into (2l+1) lines. In an experiment with l = 0 (ground state), the beam splits into
two separate beams. Therefore, some additional angular momentum is required
to explain the above observation.
Solved Problem 3:
Show that S1 · S2 = S1zS2z + (S1+S2− + S1−S2+)/2.
We have
S1 · S2 = S1xS2x + S1yS2y + S1zS2z ,

Substituting these in the expression for S1·S2 we get S1·S2 = S1zS2z+(S1+S2−+S1−S2+)/2.270 Theory of Angular Momentum

z = 1, σxσy = iσz, σyσz = iσx, σzσx = iσy, (11.101a)
σxσy + σyσx = 0, σyσz + σzσy = 0, σzσx + σxσz = 0. (11.101b)

11.4.8 Density Matrix of a Spin-1/2 System
Let us consider a spin-1/2 system whose spin states are labeled as | ↑i and | ↓i. Suppose we
are dealing with electron beams. The density matrix of an electron in the spin state | ↑i is
ρ↑ = | ↑ih↑ | while the density matrix for an electron in the spin state | ↓i is ρ↓ = | ↓ih↓ |.
Suppose the two beams are mixed. For a pure state
|ψi = c1| ↑i + c2| ↓i. (11.112)
The condition hψ|ψi = 1 gives |c1|
2 + |c2|
2 = 1. The density matrix is

P = ρP and hψ| A|ψi = Tr(ρP A ) = Tr( A ρP) for any

The eigenvalues of ρ must be real and nonnegative. The eigenvalue equation for the matrix
ρ is det(ρ − λI) = 0 which gives

Then λ1,2 =

/2. Since λ1, λ2 > 0, we have P2 ≥ 1.
We can easily obtain the expectation value of a spin operator hSi, where S = (~/2)σ.
We write
hσxi = Tr(σxP) = Tr 1
2
(σx + Px + iσzPy − iσyPz) = Px . (11.120)
Similarly, we obtain hσyi = Py and hσzi = Pz. Thus, we can write hσi = P and hSi =
(~/2)hσi = (~/2)P. We note that P gives the average spin vector of the ensemble and is
called the polarization vector . The spin is completely polarized (a pure state) if P2 = 1.
The spin is said to be in a pure state corresponding to the eigenstate of P · S with the
eigenvalue ~/2. P = 0 corresponds to an unpolarized spin. Further, we obtain
Trρ
2 = Tr 1

Therefore, Trρ

is maximum when P2 = 1. In other words, Trρ
2 = 1 represents a full
polarization and Trρ
2 = 1/2 corresponds to null polarization.
11.5 Spin-Orbit Coupling
There is a magnetic moment (µ) associated with the intrinsic rotation of the electron. It is
proportional to the spin S. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field created
by the orbital motion of the electron. This is called spin-orbital interaction. The energy of
this interaction is proportional to L·S. For an electron in a spherically symmetric potential
the proportionality factor is shown to be (e/2m2

The spin-orbit interaction or coupling gives a shift in energy due to the electron possessing
both orbital and spin angular momenta.
Spin-orbit coupling is found to be important in the field of spintronics [16]. Spin-splitting
in energy spectrum due to spin-orbit coupling in nanotubes and a model of spin-orbit in￾teraction in graphene have been reported [17]. Spin-orbit coupling induced spin-Hall effect
[18], BE condensation [19,20] and new exotic phases of matter [21] were realized. The effect
of spin-orbit interaction on band structure in quantum wires and graphene was investigated
[22,23]. The spin and orbital entanglement is found to give rise new and interesting phe￾nomena such as relativistic Mott-insulating behaviour in transition metal oxides, topological
nontrivial states and superexchange borals and spin liquid states. Spin-orbit interaction has
received a great interest in doped spin-orbital systems, Kondo systems, Majorana and Weyl
fermions, multiferroics, spin Hall effect and skyrmion lattices.
What is the form of the probability current density for a particle with spin and experi￾encing the spin-orbit interaction? We obtain the continuity equation for spin-1/2 electrons.
Choose the set {X, Sz} as a complete set of commuting operators and generalize ψ as
ψ(X, σ, t). That is,
ψ(X, σ, t) = 
ψ(X, ↑, t)
ψ(X, ↓, t)


where ↑ and ↓ take the value 1/2 and −1/2, respectively. Consequently, the probability
density function ρ(X, t) is given by
ρ(X, t) = X

11.6 Addition of Angular Momenta
Let us introduce Jx, Jy and Jz as the operators corresponding to the components of an an￾gular momentum which may be an orbital angular momentum or a spin angular momentum
or even an addition of two angular momenta. Coupling angular momenta may arise due to
an interaction. We may think of coupling orbital and spin angular momenta of a particle or
coupling of the angular momenta of different particles.
Suppose we consider a system of particles. The properties obeyed by them for a single
particle are also satisfied by the respective operators for a system of particles. Let us consider
the orbital angular momentum. The total angular momentum operator for a system of
particles is defined as
J =

can also be obtained based on the uncertainty relation for the com￾ponents of J [14].276 Theory of Angular Momentum
11.6.1 Clebsch–Gordan Coefficients
Now, we describe the combining of the angular momenta associated with various subsystems
of a given system. For simplicity, consider the addition of two angular momenta J1 and J2
of two noninteracting systems 1 and 2. Here J1,2 is the sum of the orbital angular momenta
L1,2 and spin angular momenta S1,2. J1 and J2 are combined to form a total angular
momentum J as J = J1 + J2. The individual eigenstates of 1 and 2 satisfy
J
2
1
|j1m1i = j1(j1 + 1)~
2
|j1m1i, (11.137a)
J1z|j1m1i = m1~|j1m1i, (11.137b)
J
2
2
|j2m2i = j2(j2 + 1)~
2
|j2m2i, (11.137c)
J2z|j2m2i = m2~|j2m2i. (11.137d)
For noninteracting systems J1, J2 and J are fixed. The eigenstates |j1m1; j2m2i separate
into |j1m1i and |j2m2i. We write |j1m1; j2m2i as a tensor product of |j1m1i and |j2m2i.
We define the tensor product or basis vectors as
|j1m1; j2m2i = |j1m1i|j2m2i, (11.138)
where m1 = −j1, . . . , j1, m2 = −j2, . . . , j2.
Let us denote the new basis set as |jmi with
J
2
|jmi = j(j + 1)~
2
|jmi, (11.139a)
Jz|jmi = m~|jmi. (11.139b)
Any |jmi is written as a linear combination of the states |j1m1; j2m2i:
|jmi =
X
m1
X
m2
|j1m1; j2m2ihj1m1; j2m2|jmi. (11.140)
The coefficients hj1m1; j2m2|jmi are called Clebsch–Gordan3
(CG) coefficients or vector
coupling coefficients. They are determined by a systematic procedure and are required to
construct the states |jmi. For simplicity, we use the notation hm1; m2| for hj1m1; j2m2|.
Because Jz = J1z + J2z from Eqs. (11.137b), (11.137d) and (11.139b) we get m =
m1 + m2. That is,
hm1; m2|jmi = 0 , unless m2 = m − m1 . (11.141)
This restricts the summation in Eq. (11.140):
|jmi =
X
m1
|m1; m − m1ihm1; m − m1|jmi. (11.142)
The maximum value of m is j1 + j2 since the maximum values of m1 and m2 are j1 and j2,
respectively. j1 + j2 is also the maximum value of j. The minimum value of j is |j1 − j2|.
The possible values of j are
j1 + j2, j1 + j2 − 1, . . . , |j1 − j2| . (11.143)
3Paul Albert Gordan was born on 27 April 1837 in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland) and died
on 21 December 1912 in Erlangen, Germany. Rudolf Friedrich Alfred Clebsch was a German mathematician
born on 19 January 1833 and died on 7 November 1872.Addition of Angular Momenta 277
We prove that if Eq. (11.143) holds then the dimensionality of the space spanned by
|j1m1; j2m2i is the same as that of the space spanned by |jmi. Since m1 takes 2j1 + 1 values
and m2 takes 2j2 + 1 values, the dimensionality of the space spanned by |j1m1; j2m2i is
N = (2j1 + 1) (2j2 + 1) . (11.144a)
To find the dimensionality of the space spanned by |jmi kets, we write (assuming j1 > j2)
N =
j
X1+j2
j=j1−j2
(2j + 1)
=
1
2
[2 (j1 − j2) + 1 + 2 (j1 + j2) + 1] (2j2 + 1)
= (2j1 + 1) (2j2 + 1) . (11.144b)
Since both the space have the same dimensionality Eq. (11.140) holds.
11.6.2 Recursion Relations for the Clebsch–Gordan Coefficients
The CG coefficients form a unitary matrix. Further more, the matrix elements are taken
to be real by convention. The unitary matrix becomes an orthogonal matrix. We can easily
verify that the CG coefficients are real and orthogonal:
hm1; m2|jmi = hjm|m1; m2i, (11.145a)

Consider the special case: j1 = j, m′ = m = m1 + m2. Then we obtain from (11.145b)
X
m1
X
m2
|hm1; m2|jmi|2 = 1 (11.145d)
which is the normalization condition for |jmi.
With j1, j2 and j fixed, the coefficients with different m1 and m2 are related to each
other by recursion relations. Using Eq. (11.139) we get
J±|jmi = (J1± + J2±)
X
m1
X
m2
|m1m2ihm1m2|jmi. (11.145e)
Using Eq. (11.136c), we obtain (with m1 → m′

2 ± 1 for the second term we obtain the desired recursion
relations

= [j1(j1 + 1) − m1(m1 ∓ 1)]1/2
hm1 ± 1; m2|jmi
+ [j2(j2 + 1) − m2(m2 ∓ 1)]1/2
hm1; m2 ∓ 1|jmi. (11.146)
These recursion relations and the normalization condition determine all the CG coefficients.
11.6.3 General Formula for the Clebsch–Gordan Coefficients
The general formula for the CG coefficients is
hm1; m2|jmi = δm1+m2;m α β , (11.147a)
where
α = (2j + 1) (s − 2j)! (s − 2j2)! (s − 2j1)!
(s + 1)! (j1 + m1)! (j1 − m1)!

for which all of the factorial arguments are ≥ 0. The above formula is difficult to work with,
so we present three special cases.

0 and −1. The states |jmi are

Tables 11.1 and 11.2 present the CG coefficients where j2 = 1/2 or 1.
The eigenvectors of L

coordinate representation for the composite state |l1m1; l2m2i is given by the projection
hθ1φ1; θ2φ2|l1m1; l2m2i = Yl1m1
(θ1, φ1)Yl2m2

11.7 Rotational Transformation of a Vector Wave Function and
Spin
For a scalar field ψ the operators Lx, Ly and Lz are the generators of the infinitesimal
rotation about the three coordinate axes through the angles ∆θx, ∆θy and ∆θz, respectively.282 Theory of Angular Momentum
A particle possessing internal degrees of freedom like spin is classified by considering the
transformation properties of the wave function under rotation. For an infinitesimal rotation
∆θn = i∆θx + j∆θy + k∆θz (11.168)
the relation r
′ = R(n, θ)r up to the first-order in ∆θ is
r
′ = r + ∆θn × r, R(n, ∆θ) ≈


1 −∆θz ∆θy
∆θz 1 −∆θx
−∆θy ∆θx 1

 . (11.169)
If ψ(r) transforms like a scalar then we have the Eqs. (11.3) and (11.8).
For a particle described by a vector wave function Ψ(r) instead of a scalar wave function
ψ(r), both r and Ψ(r) will transform like a vector due to a rotation. Hence, the transfor￾mation must be given as

(∆θn · L)Ψ(r) + ∆θn × Ψ(r). (11.170)
Using
∆θ n × Ψ(r) = −
i
~
(∆θ n · S)Ψα(r) (11.171)
we get the components of S as the following 3 × 3 matrices
Sx = i~


Sz = i~


0 −1 0
1 0 0
0 0 0

 . (11.172)
The transformation is given as
Ψ
′
(r) = UR(n, ∆θ)ψ(r). (11.173)
From Eqs. (11.171)–(11.173) we get the transformation equation for the infinitesimal rota￾tion of a vector wave function as
UR(n, ∆θ) = I −
i
~
∆θ n · (L + S). (11.174)
If the wave function transforms like a vector then the three generators of infinitesimal
rotations are
Jx = Lx + Sx , Jy = Ly + Sy and Jz = Lz + Sz , (11.175)
where J = L + S is identified as the total angular momentum of the particle. Since Sx,
Sy and Sz are independent of x, y and z, all the components of L commute with all the
components of S. L acts only on the r dependence of Ψ(r) and the operator S rearranges
the components of the vector wave function Ψ(r) without affecting its r dependence. In
case where H contains terms coupling S and L to each other, L and S do not separately
commutes with H but J commutes with Rotational Properties of Vector Operators 283
We find from Eq. (11.172) that the total spin operator S
2 = S
2
x + S
2
y + S
2
z has the
eigenvalue 2~
2
. Since the eigenvalue of the angular momentum operator is s(s + 1)~
2
, we
find s = 1. If the spin quantum number of a particle is 1 then its wave function transforms
like a vector. For particles like electrons having a spin quantum number 1/2, the wave
function transforms like a two-component spinor. We conclude that different transformation
properties of the wave function lead to different values of the spin.
11.8 Rotational Properties of Vector Operators
A vector in classical physics transform like Vi →
P
j RijVj , i, j = 1, 2, 3, where Rij = R(n, θ)
is the 3 × 3 rotational matrix. It is reasonably assumed that hVi in quantum mechanics
transform like a classical vector under rotation. Specifically, as the state ket |αi is changed
under a finite rotation according to |αi → UR(n, θ)|αi the hVi is assumed to change as
hα|Vi
|αi → hα|U
†
R(n, θ)ViUR(n, θ)|αi =
X
j
Rij hα|Vj |αi. (11.176)
This is true for any arbitrary |αi. Therefore,
U
†
R
(n, θ)ViUR(n, θ) = X
j
RijVj (11.177)
must hold as an operator equation. Let us consider a specific case, an infinitesimal rotation
∆θ in the direction n. When the rotation is infinitesimal, we have
UR(n, ∆θ) = I − i∆θ n · J/~ . (11.178)
We now write (11.177) as
Vi +
∆θ
i~
[Vi
, n · J] = X
j
Rij (n, ∆θ)Vj . (11.179)
In particular, for n along the z-axis, we have from Eq. (11.2)
R(n, ∆θz) =


1 −∆θz 0
∆θz 1 0
0 0 1

 . (11.180)
Therefore,
i = 1 : Vx +
∆θz
i~
[Vx, Jz] = Vx − ∆θzVy . (11.181a)
i = 2 : Vy +
∆θz
i~
[Vy, Jz] = Vy + ∆θzVx . (11.181b)
i = 3 : Vz +
∆θz
i~
[Vz, Jz] = Vz . (11.181c)
This means that the vector operator V must satisfy the commutation relations [Vi
, Jj ] =
iǫijk~Vk, where ǫijk, which is known as the totally antisymmetric unit tensor, is defined by
ǫ123 = ǫ231 = ǫ312 = 1 and ǫ321 = ǫ213 = ǫ132 = −1 with all other components equal to zero.284 Theory of Angular Momentum
Clearly, the behaviour of any vector operator V under a finite rotation is completely
determined by the commutation relations (11.181). We use (11.181) as the defining property
of a vector operator. Notice that the angular momentum commutation relations (11.135a)
and (11.135b) are a special case of (11.181) in which we let Vi → Ji
, Vk → Jk. Other special
cases Vi → r, Jk → Lk give [y, Lz] = i~x, [x, Lz] = −i~y, etc. Similarly, if Vi → pi
, we get
[px, Lz] = −i~py, [py, Lz] = i~pz, etc.
11.9 Tensor Operators and the Wigner–Eckart Theorem
In the previous sections, we examined the rotational properties of scalar and vector opera￾tors. Operators with rotational properties of higher-order than scalars and vectors can also
be constructed.
11.9.1 Tensor Operators
A Cartesian tensor transforms like
Tijk... =
X
i
′j
′k′
. . . Rii′Rjj′Rkk′ . . . T ′
i
′j
′k′ (11.182)
under a rotation where R is the 3 × 3 rotation matrix. The number of indices is called the
rank of a tensor. For example, a Cartesian tensor of rank two (called dyadic) is obtained
as Tij = UiVj , where Ui and Vj are the components of a Cartesian vector. Tij has nine
components. But Cartesian tensors are not in a convenient form as they can be decomposed
into objects that transform differently under rotation. In other words, Cartesian tensors are
reducible. For example, the dyadic in Tij = UiVj can be decomposed as
UiVj =
1
3
(U · V)δij +
1
2
(UiVj − UjVi) + 
1
2
(UiVj + UjVi) −
1
3
U · Vδij
. (11.183)
The first term on the right-hand side, U · V, is a scalar product invariant under rotations.
The second term is an antisymmetric tensor and is written as ǫijk(U × V)k. There are
3 independent components. The last term is a 3 × 3 symmetric traceless tensor with 5
(6 − 1, where 1 comes from the traceless condition) independent components, totally we
get the required 9 independent components of Tij . We note that the spherical harmonics
Ylm(θ, φ) has 1 independent component for l = 0, 3 independent components for l = 1 and
5 independent components for l = 2. This suggests that the dyadic Tij can be decomposed
into tensor that transforms like spherical harmonics with l = 0, 1 and 2. In fact Eq. (11.183)
illustrates an example of reducing a Cartesian tensor into irreducible spherical tensors as
Ylm(θ, φ) is an example of spherical tensor.
We have seen that |αi is any state, and Oˆ, an operator representing some dynamical
variable of a quantum system, then rotation through an infinitesimal angle ∆θ about the
direction n takes
|αi → (I − i∆θn · J)|αi (11.184)
and
Oˆ → (I − i∆θn · J)Oˆ(I + i∆θn · J) ≈ Oˆ − i∆θn · [J, Oˆ] . (11.185)Tensor Operators and the Wigner–Eckart Theorem 285
Thus, the changes in |αi and Oˆ, brought about by infinitesimal rotations, are directly
expressed in terms of J|αi and [J, Oˆ], respectively. The commutator with J determines the
rotation properties of an operator. Since Ylm(θ, φ) are tensor operators, let us study their
commutation relation with J. Since Jz = −i~∂/∂φ we have
JzYlmf(θ, φ) = f(θ, φ)JzYlm + YlmJzf(θ, φ) (11.186)
and
[JzYlm − YlmJz]f = m~Ylmf . (11.187)
Since f(θ, φ) is arbitrary, we obtain the commutation relation
[Jz, Ylm] = m~Ylm . (11.188a)
In a similar fashion
[J±, Ylm] = [l(l + 1) − m(m ± 1)]1/2
~Yl,m±1 . (11.188b)
Now, define an irreducible tensor operator T (k), where k = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, . . ., to be a set of
2k + 1 operators T (k, q), where q = k, k − 1, . . . , −k that have commutations with J similar
to those in Eqs. (11.188):
[Jz, T (k, q)] = q~T (k, q), (11.189a)
[J±, T (k, q)] = [k(k + 1) − q(q ± 1)]1/2
~T (k, q ± 1). (11.189b)
These relations can be considered as a definition of spherical tensors. Since the tensor
operator T (k, q) and the spherical harmonics |jmi satisfy the same commutation relations
(11.188) and (11.189), tensor operators can be combined in accordance with the same rule
as angular momentum eigenstates.
We have the basis |j1m1, j2m2i which is the tensor product of the basis |j1m1i and
|j2m2i. We have seen in Eq. (11.140) that a new basis |jmi can be given as a linear coefficient
of the tensor product basis |j1m1, j2m2i using the CG coefficients hj1m1, j2m2|jmi. Hence,
an analog to Eq. (11.140) using the correspondence T1(k1, q1) → |j1m1i, T2(k2, q2) → |j2m2i
and T (k, q) → |jmi gives the product of tensors relation
T (k, q) = X
k1
q1=−k1
X
k2
q2=−k2
T1(k1, q1)T2(k2, q2)hq1q2|kqi, (11.190)
where the CG coefficients hq1q2|kqi corresponds to j1 = k1 and j2 = k2. We can prove that if
T1(k1, q1) and T2(k2, q2) are irreducible spherical tensors of rank k1 and k2, respectively, then
T (k, q) is also an irreducible tensor of rank k by verifying that T (k, q) satisfies Eq. (11.189).
Using J = J1 + J2 and [J, T1T2] = [J, T1] T2 + T1 [J, T2] we obtain
[Jz, T (k, q)] = X
q1
X
q2
{[Jz, T1] T2 + T1 [Jz, T2]} hq1q2|kqi. (11.191)
Since T1 and T2 satisfy Eq. (11.189), we get
[Jz, T (k, q)] = X
q1
X
q2
(q1 + q2)~T1(k1, q1)T2(k2, q2)hq1q2|kqi. (11.192)
Because hq1q2|kqi is zero unless q1 + q2 = q, we get from (11.191)
[Jz, T (k, q)] = q~T (k, q). (11.193)286 Theory of Angular Momentum
It is easy to show that
[J±, T (k, q)] = [k(k + 1) − q(q ± 1)]1/2
~T (k, q ± 1). (11.194)
From Eqs. (11.193) and (11.194) we find that the product T (k, q) is also an irreducible
tensor operator. The construction of the operator T (k, q) is in exact analogy with that of
the states |jmi from states |j1m1; j2m2i.
Solved Problem 6:
Show that hjm, α′
|T (k1, q1)|α, j2m2i = 0 if m 6= q1 + m2.
The tensor operator T (k1, q1) satisfies the relation
[Tz, T (k1, q1)] = ~q1T (k1, q1). (11.195)
Then
hjm, α′
| [Jz, T (k1, q1)] α, j2m2i = hjm, α′

|T |α, j2m2i.
(11.196)
From Eqs. (11.195) and (11.196) we get
(m − m2)~hjm, α′
|T |α, j2m2i = ~q1hjm, α′
|T |α, j2m2i. (11.197)
We find m − m2 = q1, that is, m = q1 + m2. Therefore, hjm, α′
|T (k1, q1)|α, j2m2i = 0 if
m 6= q1 + m2.
11.9.2 The Wigner–Eckart Theorem
In considering the interactions of an electromagnetic field with atoms and nuclei, it is often
necessary to evaluate matrix elements of tensor operators with respect to angular momen￾tum eigenstates |jmi. Since |jmi are also tensor operators, we write from Eq. (11.190)
|jmi =
XT1(k1, q1)|j2m2i hq1m2|jmi. (11.198)
The series expansion of |jmi in terms of T1(k1, q1)|j2m2i, given in Eq. (11.198) can be
inverted by making use of the orthonormality of the CG coefficients:
T1(k1, q1)|j2m2i =
X
j
m=−j
k
X1+j2
j=|k1−j2|
|jmihq1m2|jmi, (11.199)
where we have used hjm|q1m2i = hq1m2|jmi as CG coefficients and are taken as real. If we
include explicitly quantum numbers other than j and m for the state by α, then Eq. (11.199)
is given as
T1(k1, q1)|α, j2m2i =
X

i is the normalization factor. Dropping the primes and writing
in the standard notation for N, the matrix element of tensor operators with respect to
angular momentum eigenstates are given as

(2j + 1)−1/2
hj, α′
||T (k)||α, j2ihq1m2|jmi. (11.204)
The above equation is known as Wigner–Eckart theorem. This theorem states that the
matrix element is the product of two terms. The physical properties of the matrix element
are contained in hj, α′
||T (k)||α, j2i. The second term is a CG coefficient for adding j2 and
k to get j. It depends only on the way the system is oriented with respect to the z-axis.
The first factor depends on the dynamics, for instance, α may stand for the radial quantum
number. On the other hand, it is independent of magnetic quantum numbers m1, m2 and
q1 which specify the orientation of the physical system. To evaluate the matrix element of
the tensor operator with various combination of m1, m2 and q1, it is sufficient to know
one of them; all others can be related geometrically because they are proportional to CG
coefficients.
The selection rule for tensor operator matrix element is read-off from the selection rules
for adding angular momentum. Indeed, from the requirement that the CG coefficients can
be nonvanishing we obtain the m-selection rule as m = q1 + m2 and the triangular relation
|j2 − k1| ≤ j ≤ j2 + k1.
11.10 Concluding Remarks
We note that angular position is restricted to values between −π to π whereas linear position
can take any value. A consequence of this is that the uncertainty in the angular position
is always finite. Another implication is that the angular momentum is quantized and can
only have its eigenvalues whereas linear position can take any value. For a big fly-wheel or
cycle-wheel one could think that by giving it various angular velocities one can make the
fly-wheel to have any angular momentum. But this is not true. Angular momentum can only
be increased in discrete steps of ~. Because ~ = 1.0546 × 10−27ergs-sec is very small that
in the example of fly-wheel the step increased is hardly visible. Another point is that Y00 is
an eigenfunction of the three operators Lx, Ly and Lz. It is a simultaneous eigenfunction of
these three operators which are noncommuting. In this sense Y00 is a special eigenfunction.
If a system is in Y00 state then we know the three components of angular momentum with
certainty−they are all zero.288 Theory of Angular Momentum
We note that the effect of L± on a spherical eigenstate for any central potential is to
change the value of m. The other quantum numbers l and n are unchanged. This is due
to the symmetry of the central potential. Thus, L± are ladder operators for any central
potential.
According to Eq. (11.82), the mechanism underlying spin is not essentially different from
that underlying orbital angular momentum. Both forms of angular momentum arise from
the momentum density in the fields. The distinction between spin and orbital contributions
to the total angular momentum merely results from the independence of these contribu￾tions. The position of the momentum density that gives rise to the spin can be reversed
independently of the position that gives rise to the orbital angular momentum.

Hydrogen Atom
12.1 Introduction
The hydrogen atom is the simplest of all atoms consisting of proton of charge e and the
electron of charge −e. It is a two particle system. A two-body problem can always be
reduced to a one-body problem by choosing the centre of mass coordinate and the relative
coordinates. In the hydrogen atom, the attractive force exerted by the proton on electron
prevents it from escape. The potential energy V of the system is −e
2/r (or −e
2/(4πǫ0r)),
where r is the distance between the electron and the proton. Note that the potential energy
approaches −∞ when the electron becomes near the location of proton. Suppose the nucleus
is held fixed at the origin of coordinates. V (r) is independent of θ and φ, that is, insensitive
to the direction of r and depends only on the scalar magnitude r. The potential energy
remains invariant under rotation and is said to be spherically symmetric. Figure 12.1 shows
V (r) as a function of r. In this chapter, the hydrogen atom problem in three-dimension is
solved and momentum eigenfunction is obtained. The problem in D-dimension is analyzed.
The magnetic field produced by a hydrogen atom is worked out. Finally, the system in
parabolic coordinates is discussed.
12.2 Hydrogen Atom in Three-Dimension
In the hydrogen atom, an electron of mass me is coupled to a proton of mass mp. The force
is the Coulomb force −e

where ∇i
, i = 1, 2 is the Laplacian operator and ψ = ψ(r1, r2, t) is the joint probability
amplitude function of finding the electron at r1 and the proton at r2 at time t.
For atoms which are isoelectronic with hydrogen atom such as He+, Li++, Be+++,
etc, the potential is −Ze2/r, where Z is 2, 3, 4, etc., respectively. For these atoms we have
Eq. (12.1) with e
2/|r1−r2| replaced by −Ze2/|r1−r2|. Introducing the relative displacement
r = r1 − r2, and the centre of mass displacement R = (mer1 + mpr2)/(me + mp), the
Schr¨odinger Eq. (12.1) becomes

as the eigenfunctions of Eq. (12.1), ψ(r1, r2, t) cannot be written as a product ψ1(r1)ψ2(r2),

The Φ given above is also an eigenfunction of Lz with the eigenvalue m~. Since the Hamilto￾nian for a magnetic field applied along the z-direction is HB = −eBLz/(2m), the first-order
perturbation due to a magnetic field shifts energy levels proportional to m and hence m
is some times called a magnetic quantum number . Normalization of Φ gives A = 1/

Then Eq. (12.25) is the Schr¨odinger equation for a particle of mass µ moving in the effective
potential Veff. From E = H = p
2/(2µ) + Veff we have E − Veff = p
2/(2µ) ≥ 0. The region
with E − Veff ≥ 0 is the classically allowed region. E − Veff = 0 gives the turning points at
which the velocity of the particle is zero. Figure 12.2 shows r versus Veff for a few values of
l. We see from Fig. 12.2 that for l 6= 0, Veff(r → 0) → +∞. An infinite potential at some
point means that the wave function must vanish there, that is, R(r) → 0 for l 6= 0.

The physically acceptable solution of Eq. (12.31) must vanish at ρ = 0 (that is at r = 0)
since R = f(ρ)/r. When the electron is far from the nucleus we assume ρ be very large
and neglect the terms containing 1/ρ and 1/ρ2
in Eq. (12.31). In this case f

whose solution is f(ρ) = e−ρ/2

approximation. For more general situation choose f(ρ) = F(ρ)e−ρ/2

p = (2l + 1) is physically acceptable and p = −(2l + 1) is unacceptable since R → ∞ as

orbital quantum number l cannot exceed n − 1 for a acceptable solution.

12.2.4 Features of Energy Eigenstates
Let us enumerate the features of eigenstates of hydrogen atom in the following.
1. There are infinite number of energy levels as n takes values 1, 2, . . ..
2. As n increases |En| decreases and En → 0 as n → ∞. The lowest energy cor￾responds to n = 1. An energy of 0 corresponds to ionization of the hydrogen
atom, that is complete separation of the proton and the electron with both the
particles at rest. Figure 12.4 shows first few energy levels of hydrogen atom along
with the few energy levels of linear harmonic oscillator and particle in a box for
comparison.
3. We write En = −E1/n2
, where E1 = µe4/(2~
2
) ≈ −13.6 eV.
4. The energy difference between nth and (n+1)th levels is given by ∆En = E1(2n+
1)/(n
2
(n + 1)2
). As n increases ∆En decreases.
5. En depends on n and independent of l and m. Therefore, each of the functions
RYlm (m = −l, . . . , l) is a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation of the hydro￾gen atom for the same value of E. The energy levels are thus degenerate. How
many energy levels do exist with the same En? We know that l takes the values
0, 1, . . . , n−1 and for each l, m = l, l−1, . . . , −l+1, −l. There are (2l+1) values
of m labelled by n different values of l. Thus, the total number of degeneracy is
given by
nX−1
l=0
(2l + 1) = X2l +
Xl =
2n(n − 1)
2
+ n = n
2
. (12.65)
6. Since electrons have two spin states, two electrons can be accommodated in a
single state. The ground state (n = 1) is nondegenerate. All other states are
degenerate states. The existence of degenerate energy eigenvalues implies that
linear combination of the corresponding eigenfunctions are solutions of the wave

An algebraic method for solving hydrogen-like atoms is described in ref.[2]. For the
construction of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of bound states in
central potentials one may refer to refs. [3, 4].

12.3 Hydrogen Atom in D-Dimension
In this section, we are concerned with the bound states (E < 0) of the hydrogen atom in
D-dimension, where D may be noninteger [5]. We restrict ourselves to radial part of the
problem.306 Hydrogen Atom
The Coulomb potential is taken as V = −e
2/r for all values of D. For D = 1, r is to be
interpreted as |r|. For the three-dimensional case the radial Eq. (12.24) is rewritten as

12.4 Field Produced by a Hydrogen Atom
In this section, we calculate the magnetic field in a hydrogen atom [6]. The contribution
from both the orbital and spin motion of the electron are considered. The calculations are
nonrelativistic and the energy eigenstates |nlmlmsi and |nljmji are alone considered. The
calculation is tedious for a state of superposition of these eigenfunctions. This is because it
is incorrect simply to add the fields due to each eigenstate.Field Produced by a Hydrogen Atom 307
12.4.1 General Considerations
For ml 6= 0 states, we treat the electron cloud as circulating round the z-axis. This orbital
motion produces the magnetic field. The different parts of the cloud may be circulating in
opposite directions. Now, the probability current density is given by
J =
~
2mi
[ψ
∗∇ψ − (∇ψ
∗
)ψ] , (12.83)
where m is mass of the electron. The electric current density j is
j = −eJ = iµB [ψ
∗∇ψ − (∇ψ
∗
)ψ] , (12.84)
where µB = e~/(2m) is the Bohr magnetron .
Assuming ψ = F(r, θ)eimlφ
for an energy eigenstate |nlmli, Eq. (12.84) in spherical
polar coordinates gives (the proof is left as an exercise to the reader)
j = (0)r1 + (0)θˆ1 −

Using Eq. (12.86) the vector potential A and the field is calculated. Since A will be directed
in the direction of the current density we have Ar = Aθ = 0 and ∂Aφ/∂φ = 0. Hence, r and
θ components of ∇2A vanish. Then

12.4.4 Application to Particular State
When ml = 0, Eq. (12.86) gives jφ = 0 and therefore the field vanishes. On the other hand,
from Eq. (12.86) we note that if the sign of ml
is changed, then j changes sign and hence
so do A and B. Therefore, we consider only the states with ml > 0.

electric field E0 is along the z-axis so that E0 = E0z. Then the electron and proton are
stretched apart in the z-direction. Now, the atom becomes elongated along the z-axis and
the parabolic coordinates system is better suited than spherical polar coordinates to describe
the system. The Schr¨odinger equation of the system is

For E0 = 0 the problem reduces to that of the hydrogen atom. As shown in sec. 12.2 the
energy of a bound state is En = −1/(2n
2
). Now, introduce two new coordinates ρ1 = ξ/n,
ρ2 = η/n and write nβi = αi + (|m| + 1)/2, i = 1, 2. Then Eqs. (12.110) take the form

12.5.2 Solution for Large E0
For large enough external field, E0, the motion is dominated by the states, α1 = 0, α2 > 0

12.6 Concluding Remarks
Since the potential for a hydrogen-like atom is given by V (r) = −Ze2/r, and the nuclear
mass is different, the energy eigenvalues and the position of maximum radial probability
distribution will all be different. The hydrogenic ions He+(Z = 2), Li2+(Z = 3), Be3+(Z =
4) etc. are examples of such systems. The (neutral) isotopes of atomic hydrogen, deuterium
and tritium also provide examples of hydrogenic systems. Since the mass of deuterium is
md ≈ 2mp and that of tritium is mt ≈ 3mp, the reduced masses of them will be slightly
different from that of hydrogen. These small differences in the values of µ give rise to isotopic
shifts of the spectral lines.
In addition to deuterium and tritium, there exists other hydrogenic systems in which the
role of proton is played by another positive particle. For example, positronium is a bound312 Hydrogen Atom
hydrogenic system made of a positron e+ and an electron. Muonium is another example of
such a system in which the proton is replaced by a positive muon µ
+, a particle which is
very smaller to the positron, except that it has a mass mµ ≈ 207me and is unstable with a
life-time of about 2.2 × 10−6
sec.
In all the above mentioned hydrogenic atoms the negative particle is an electron. Other
negative particles could form a bound system with a positive nucleon. For example, a
negative muon µ
− can be captured by the Coulombic attraction of a nucleon of charge Ze,
thus forming a muonic atom. The simplest example of muonic atom is the bound system
(p+µ
−) consisting of a proton p+ and a negative µ
−. The radius a of muonic hydrogen
(p+µ
−) is nearly 186 times smaller than that of ordinary hydrogen atom. The reduced mass
of muonic hydrogen is ≈ 186me.

Perturbation Theory
13.1 Introduction
The starting point in a quantum mechanical problem is the construction of a Schr¨odinger
equation. We try to solve it exactly to obtain wave function. A Schr¨odinger equation is
exactly solvable only for a certain number of simple potentials. In most of the cases the
Schr¨odinger equation cannot be solved exactly. The solution of the Schr¨odinger equation
for the real systems is usually complicated and often exact solutions are very difficult to
find or solutions do not exist. Examples include as anharmonic oscillator, hydrogen atom
in an electric field, a plane rotator in the presence of an applied electric field and so on.
Therefore, we need to rely on approximation methods. The simple and most interesting and
powerful approximate method is the perturbation theory developed by Schr¨odinger in 1926
[1]. Earlier Lord Rayleigh [2] analyzed harmonic vibrations of a string perturbed by small
inhomogeneities. The work of Rayleigh was pointed out by Schr¨odinger. Consequently, the
method is also called Rayleigh–Schro¨dinger perturbation theory. This method is powerful
for determining the changes in the discrete energy values and the associated eigenfunctions
of a system due to a weak perturbation, provided the eigenfunctions of the undisturbed
system are available. The approximations obtained from the perturbation theory are used
to calculate energy level diagrams and to understand the splitting and assignments of atomic
and molecular spectra [3–5]. The perturbation theory has been proven to be useful in several
fields of theoretical physics and also in chemistry. It provides considerable insight into
various phenomena. The main disadvantage of this method is that in certain problems the
perturbation series converges slowly or diverges.
In perturbation problems the Hamiltonian is split into two parts. One part called unper￾turbed part is large and the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation is assumed to be exactly
solvable. The other part is treated as perturbation. The changes in the energies and the
eigenfunctions are represented as a power series in the perturbation parameter. The approx￾imation consists of neglecting terms in the series after the first few terms. Approximating
the series to the first n terms gives the n-th order approximation.
In this chapter, we develop the perturbation theory for the time-independent pertur￾bation. We consider the theory for both degenerate and nondegenerate energy levels. We
apply the theory to a few physically interesting problems. The problem of time-dependent
perturbation will be discussed in the next chapter.

13.2 Theory for Nondegenerate Case
Let H(0) be the unperturbed Hamiltonian operator and its energy eigenvalues are discrete
and nondegenerate. As noted earlier in chapter 4, by a nondegenerate energy level we mean
that there is only one linearly independent eigenfunction corresponding to that energy
level. In case there are k-linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to an energy
level then the energy level is said to be k-fold degenerate. An example of a system with
two-fold degeneracy is a free particle (see sec. 4.3).
Let the total Hamiltonian of the system be
H = H
(0) + λH(1)
, (13.1)
where H(0) is the Hamiltonian of the unperturbed system and H(1) is the perturbation. It
is desired to solve Hφn = Enφn, that is,

H(0) + λH(1)
φn = Enφn . (13.2)
When λ = 0, Eq. (13.2) reduces to
H(0)φ

The system (13.3) is assumed to be exactly solvable so that φ

n and E

n are explicitly
known. The goal is to express En and φn of the perturbed system as a power series in terms
of λ as

must be equal to zero. The first few equations obtained in this way are

(13.9). First, we solve the Eq. (13.8) to find E

Further, note that any of the function φ

n added to it
without affecting the Eqs. (13.8) and (13.9) and hence without affecting the determination
of φ

that c

We have found first- and second-order corrections to the unperturbed energy eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions. If the Hamiltonian has both discrete and continuous states then we must
include both the sum over all discrete states and the integral over all the continuous states.Theory for Nondegenerate Case 319
We notice several important points from Eqs. (13.22) and (13.25):
1. The ground state energy is always lowered in the second-order perturbation be￾cause in Eq. (13.22) the quantity E
(0)
n − E
(0)
m is negative.
2. Energies of two states are pushed apart in second-order perturbation.
3. Due to the term 1. E

if the energy levels of unperturbed systems
are close, the levels are more affected.
4. The theory breaks down if the energy levels are degenerate.
We can proceed further to obtain higher-order correction. In practice we may stop the
calculation after second-order correction.

The E

n given by Eq. (13.22) involves evaluation of infinite terms in the summation. In
some cases computation of them is a difficult task. However, this is simplified by the method
of Dalgarno and Lewis [6,7].

13.3 Applications to Nondegenerate Levels
To demonstrate the use of perturbation theory let us apply it to some interesting systems.
First, apply it to the linearly perturbed harmonic oscillator whose unperturbed and as well
as the perturbed parts are exactly solvable.
13.3.1 Perturbed Linear Harmonic Oscillator
Consider the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator in an electric field. The potential and the
Hamiltonian of the system are V (x) = mω2x
2/2 − eEx and
H = H(0) + λH(1) , H(0) =
1
2m
p

mω2x

, H(1) = −eEx . (13.50)
The system with λ = 0 is exactly solved and its energy levels and eigenfunctions are given
by Eqs. (4.33) and (4.29), respectively. The eigenpairs of the system with λ 6= 0 are also
explicitly known.
Let us obtain En(exact) of the perturbed system. Introducing the change of variable
x = y + α the Hamiltonian H becomes
H =

− λeE (y + α) . (13.51)
We set the coefficient of y to zero. This gives α = λeE/(mω2
). Then

The above equation shows that the change in energy is second-order in λ. In the following
we apply the perturbation theory to find the correction to the energy eigenvalues. We expect
the first-order correction to energy as zero.
The first-order correction to En is given by

The value of the above integral can be easily worked out if we replace the position operator x
in terms of the raising and lowering operators a
† and a introduced in sec. 4.4 and expressing
the eigenstates and the integral in Eq. (13.55) in Dirac notation.
In terms of a and a

the operator x is expressed as x =

the eigenstates as |ni. We have the relation

|ni =

The orthogonality of two eigenstates |n

13.3.2 Hyperfine Splitting of the Ground State of Hydrogen Atom [8]
The splitting of an energy level due to the interaction of the nuclear magnetic dipole and
the magnetic field Be produced by the electron orbit current is called the fine structure.
The term hyperfine structure is used to describe extremely small splitting of spectral
lines. In the following we derive the hyperfine structure of hydrogen by employing first￾order perturbation theory. We consider the hyperfine splitting of the ground state [8]. This
splitting is associated with the interaction of the magnetic moments of the proton and the
electron.
The electron and proton in atomic hydrogen constitute tiny magnetic dipoles. The mag￾netic field of a magnetic dipole kept at the centre of a sphere of radius R is given by
B(r) = µ0
4πr3
[3 (m · r) ˆr − m] + 2
3
µ0mδ
3
(r), (13.59)
where the first term is only to the region outside an infinitesimal sphere about r = 0. Then
the energy of a magnetic dipole m in the presence of a magnetic field B is H = −m · B.
Now, the energy of one magnetic dipole (m1) in the field of another magnetic dipole (m2)
is
H = −

Here m1 and m2 are the magnetic dipole moments of the proton and electron, respectively.

2
e

S

p are 3~
2/4. The two spins form a spin-1 triplet (J

) and a spin-0 singlet (J
2 = 0).
Thus,
hSe · Spi =

(13.64)
The singlet level is lower because in this state the proton and electron spins are antiparallel
(their magnetic moments are parallel). The energy gap between the triplet and singlet states
is
∆Ehyd =

γpγe = 5.884 × 10−6
eV , (13.65)
where we have substituted γe = ege/(2m), γp = egp/(2m), ge = 2.0023 and gp = 5.5857.
The frequency of the photon emitted in a transition from the triplet state to the singlet
state is γ = ∆E/h = 1422.8 MHz while the experimental value is 1420.4 MHz.
13.4 Theory for Degenerate Levels
The first-order perturbation theory developed for nondegenerate levels is not applicable
when the energy level of the unperturbed system is degenerate. This is because, if the
energy values of φ
(0)
m and φ
(0)
n are the same, say, E(0) then E
(0)
m − E
(0)
n = 0 making the
correction term in Eq. (13.18a) infinity. Therefore, we require a separate perturbation theory
for degenerate levels. Note that degeneracy in any quantum mechanical system stems from
symmetries inherent to the system. If any perturbation distorts the symmetry of the system,
then it will tend to remove the related degeneracy.
Suppose the eigenvalues of unperturbed Hamiltonian H(0) are m-fold degenerate. Then
there are m linearly independent orthogonal eigenfunctions φ

,. . .,φ

1 = E
(0)
2 = . . . = E
(0)
m = E(0). Given E(0) the correct choice of the eigenfunction out of
the above m eigenfunctions is not known. Therefore, choose the unperturbed eigenfunction
of a degenerate level as a linear combination of m eigenfunctions and allow the perturbatioTheory for Degenerate Levels 325
to choose the appropriate one. We write
φ
(0) =
Xm

where ci

The eigenstates of H(0) are given by the product of the kets |nxi and |nyi: |nxi|nyi = |nxnyi.
The corresponding energy is
Enx,ny = (nx + ny + 1) ~ω (13.79)

13.5 First-Order Stark Effect in Hydrogen
The splitting of energy levels of an atom by a uniform external field E is known as Stark
effect. The effect was discovered by Stark in 1913 during the observation of Balmer series
of hydrogen.
Suppose the hydrogen atom is subjected to an electric field along z-direction. The first
excited energy level is found to split into three energy levels. This is explained using per￾turbation theory. The perturbation is λH(1) = −eEr cos θ, where E is the strength of the
field. Choosing λ = eE we write H(1) = −r cos θ. In sec. 12.2 we solved the unperturbed
hydrogen atom. The normalized eigenfunctions are designated as ψnlm and are given by
Eq. (12.61). Applying the perturbation theory we calculate the change in the energy of the
ground state and first excited state due to the applied field.

In the above integral, integration with respect to θ becomes zero. Therefore, E
(1)
1 = 0. Thus,
there is no change in ground state energy according to first-order perturbation theory.
Since the first-order correction to E1 is zero we proceed to calculate the second-order
correction [9,10] by the Dalgarno and Lewis method described earlier. According to this
method

state eigenfunction with an eigenvalue E

1 by
the applied field. There is no Stark effect in the ground state. Classically, an energy shift of
−p · E will be realized if a system possesses an electric dipole moment p. Therefore, we say
that the atom in its ground state has no permanent dipole moment. Generally, systems in
nondegenerate states have no permanent dipole momentsFirst-Order Stark Effect in Hydrogen 329
13.5.2 First Excited State: n = 2
Next, work out the effect of the applied field on the first excited state corresponding to
n = 2. The possible values of (l, m) are (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, −1) (since l = 0, 1 and
m = −l to l). There are four states given by ψnlm → ψ200, ψ210, ψ211 and ψ21−1. The first
excited state is thus four-fold degenerate. In this case the zeroth-order wave function is

Now, one may ask: What does happen in n = 3 and higher excited states? Particularly,
we want to know whether the dipolar nature found in n = 2 states is preserved in the higher
excited states. The dipolar nature is found to be preserved in the higher excited states also
[10].
13.6 Alternate Perturbation Theories
Perturbation theory is one of the most widely used approximate methods in quantum me￾chanics due to its transparency which greatly facilitates physical insight. The calculation of
sufficient perturbation corrections is not trivial in many cases of interest and for this reason
several alternate implementations have been suggested. We have already seen in sec. 13.2.4
the Dalgarno and Lewis method. It consists of writing the nth perturbation correction to
the eigenfunction φn as Fnφ0 and then solving the resulting equation for Fn. In this section,
we discuss another perturbation theory which has been successfully applied to a variety of
problems.
13.6.1 Hypervirial Perturbation Theory
Direct application of Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger perturbation theory is tedious for the perturba￾tion containing a polynomial function like the anharmonic potentials of a diatomic molecule.
For such systems, analytic perturbation calculation of higher-order is straight-forward when
we take into account the hypervirial and Hellmann–Feynman theorems. The method, com￾monly termed perturbation theory without eigenfunctions or the hypervirial perturbation
method, has been applied to many quantum mechanical models [11].332 Approximation Methods I: Time-Independent Perturbation Theory
13.6.2 Quantum Mechanical Hypervirial Theorem (QMHT)
Let H be the time-independent and self-adjoint operator with eigenfunction ψ. Then for any
time-independent linear operator A on the space H, the QMHT states that the following
expectation value vanishes:
hψ, [A, H]ψi = 0 . (13.108)
We illustrate the usefulness of this theorem with the Hamiltonian

With A = x

relations involving the expectation values,
hx
mi = hψ, xmψi, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . , hx
0
i = 1 , (13.110)
are obtained. These relations are known as the hypervirial relations. In particular, the case
k = 1 corresponds to the usual virial theorem. To evaluate the commutators, the following
relations are useful:
[Dx, H] = dV

The identity Eq. (13.111c) is used to rewrite the commutator, while the appearance
of Dx and D2
x
are eliminated using Eqs. (13.111a)–(13.111b) and the time-independent
Schr¨odinger equation. Taking expectation values with respect to an eigenstate ψ with en￾ergy E yields the hypervirial relations

In the case of solvable Hamiltonians, like harmonic oscillator, (radial) hydrogen atom,
these relations necessarily coincide with those obtained from the knowledge of the recursion
relation between the orthogonal polynomials (Hermite and Laguerre, respectively) which
comprise the eigenfunctions. For harmonic oscillator, Eq. (13.112) produces the following
recursion relations:

13.6.3 Quantum Mechanical Hellmann–Feynman Theorem
Let Hλ be a time-independent, self-adjoint operator that depends explicitly on a scalar
parameter λ and
Hλψ = E(λ)ψ , hψ, ψi = 1 (13.114a)

13.6.4 Perturbation Expansion
The quantum mechanical hypervirial and Hellmann-Feymann theorems are used to provide
Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger perturbation expansions. The first step in the treatment of perturbed
Hamiltonians is to obtain the hypervirial relations for hx
k
i and E for a particular perturbed
eigenstate. Next, the following series expansions are assumed:
E(λ) = X∞
n=0
E
(n)λ
n
, hx
k
i(λ) = X∞
n=0
C
(n)
k
λ
n
. (13.115)
The unperturbed energy E(0) is known. As well, the normalized condition hx
0
i = 1 is
imposed, implying that C
(n)
0 = δ0n. Substitution of these into Eq. (13.113) and collecting
like powers of λ
n yield a system of difference equations involving C
(i)
k
and E(j)
. However,
this system is not closed, since the relation between these two sets of coefficients has not yet
been defined. The closure is provided by the Hellmann–Feynman relation ∂E/∂λ = hH(1)i.
The series for E(λ), Eq. (13.115), is differentiated and matched term-wise in powers of λ
with the series for hH(1)i. The C
(i)
k
array is generally calculated column-wise. A knowledge
of the nth column in C
(i)
k
array permits calculation of E(n+1) in analogy with Rayleigh–
Schr¨odinger perturbation theory using the wave function.
13.7 Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we demonstrated the power of perturbation theory in calculating the small
shifts in the spectral lines of some important systems due to the applied perturbation.
Though the corrections to the energy eigenvalues given by the perturbation theory are334 Approximation Methods I: Time-Independent Perturbation Theory
not exact, the results are accurate as long as the perturbation parameter λ is very small.
However, in certain cases the perturbation theory is undesirable, particularly, when the
systems under considerations cannot be splitted into unperturbed and perturbed parts
and also when the strength of the perturbation is very large. There are exactly solvable
systems which when subjected to certain interactions posses new set of eigenstates and they
cannot be treated as the unperturbed states + corrections. In such cases other approximation
methods such as variational method and WKB approximations are useful. An alternative
perturbation method on the application of a factorization method to a Riccati equation
derived from the Schr¨odinger equation has been developed and studied [12,13].

Approximation Methods II: Time-Dependent
Perturbation Theory
14.1 Introduction
Approximation methods are developed for systems where the time dependence of the Hamil￾tonian is small, slowly varying or rapidly varying. These correspond to perturbation, adi￾abatic and sudden approximations, respectively. In this chapter, we consider the time￾dependent perturbation theory applicable for small time-dependent perturbation. This is
the case when we wish to investigate the response of systems to incident radiation. The
incident electromagnetic wave makes the electric and magnetic potentials to oscillate and
the perturbation is usually very small compared with the static Hamiltonian. The theory
of time-dependent perturbation was developed by Dirac in 1927 [1].
In the case of time-independent perturbation, the perturbation may vary in space but
at each space point the perturbation remains the same. Hence, we assumed that the state
of the system remains the same and the effect of a weak perturbation is to slightly shift
the energy eigenvalues and the change in the eigenfunction is small. In contrast to this,
in the time-dependent perturbation as the perturbation varies with time the system may
undergo transiton from one state to another state and this can take place as long as the
perturbation is present. Thus, in the case of time-dependent perturbation instead of finding
the correction to the energy eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions we consider the probability
of finding the system in a state at time t. Determination of this probability is also generally
difficult if the perturbation is present forever. Therefore, we assume that the perturbation
is switched-on for a finite interval of time.
In this chapter, we discuss the theory for constant and harmonic perturbations applied
during a finite time interval, adiabatic and sudden perturbations. Also, we present the semi￾classical theory of radiation. The sudden and the adiabatic approximations are at opposite
ends of the time specturm, the former describing what in essence is an instantaneous change,
while the latter is applicable to those events for which dH/dt ≈ 0.

Let (En, φn) are the stationary state eigenpairs of the unperturbed system. The time evo￾lution of φn(x) is given by
φn(x, t) = e−iEnt/~φn(x). (14.2)
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172178-14 337338 Approximation Methods II: Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
Assume that the perturbation is switched-on at t = 0 and H is very close to H(0) so that
the set {φn(x, t)} is also a complete set of eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian. We write
the solution of Eq. (14.1) as
ψ(x, t) = X

an(t)e−iEnt/~φn(x), (14.3)
where an(t) to be determined. Here an(t) is the probability amplitude of finding the system
in the state φn(x, t) at time t. If the perturbation is absent then an(t) = an(0).
To determine an(t) we substitute Eq. (14.3) in Eq. (14.1) and obtain

In the time-independent perturbation theory, we expanded energy eigenvalues and the eigen￾fucntions in power series and calculated the first-order and second-order corrections. In the
case of time-dependent perturbation, we expand af in power series and determine the first￾order correction in af . We expand af (t) as

Equation (14.7) is a set of coupled integro-differential equations. If the system has m
eigenstates then Eq. (14.7) generates m coupled equations and are difficult to solve. There￾fore, we slightly modify the problem. Suppose the perturbation is switched-on at t = 0
and switched-off at t = T . The perturbation is applied during a finite time interval T . As￾sume that the system is initially in a state i with the eigenfunction φi
. Then at t = 0 the
probability of finding the system in φi
is unity and the probability of finding the systemConstant Perturbation 339
in other states φn(n 6= i) is zero: a

n = δni. Due to the applied perturbation transition
from the state i to an another state after the time T can happen. Once the perturbation is
switched-off the system settles down to a stationary state and denote this final state as f.

of finding the system in φf : Pf i = a

1. The Pf i given by Eq. (14.16) is the probability for the system to undergo a
transition from a state i to f. This transition is due to the applied perturbation.
Pf i depends on Hf i, T and ωf i (that is, Ef and Ei).
2. Selection rule: The transition from ith state to fth state is forbidden if Hf i = 0.
The selection rule is thus Hf i 6= 0340 Approximation Methods II: Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory

(ωf iT /2)]/ω2
f i as a function of ωf i for T = 1.
3. Figure 14.1 shows the plot of s = [4 sin2
(ωf iT /2)]/ω2
f i versus ωf i for fixed T . The
function s has a sharp peak centred at ωf i = 0. For small ωf i, s = T
2
. The height
of the main peak is T
2
. In this case Pf i ∝ T
2
. Hence, the probability per unit
time or transition rate Γf i is ∝ T .
4. For large ωf i, Pf i → 0.
5. Pf i is zero when sin2
(ωf iT /2) = 0, that is, ωf i ≈ 2nπ/T .
6. A striking feature of Pf i from Fig. 14.1 is that it does not change monotonically
with ωf i. It neither increases nor decreases continuously with ωf i but oscillates
with rapidly decreasing amplitude.
7. Pf i for closely spaced levels: Equation (14.16) represents the probability for
transition to one particular state φf . In real systems we wish to know Pf i for tran￾sitions to a group of closely spaced states. In this case Pf i =
R ∞
−∞ |af |
2ρf (Ef ) dEf ,
where ρf dE represents number of states in the range dE. Assume that ρ is almost
constant in the range dE. Then

where we have used the result R ∞

probability is proportional to T .
8. The transition rate per unit time is
dPf i

2π
~
ρf |Hf i|

(14.18)
which is independent of T . The general form of the above formula is applicable to
atomic transitions, nuclear decay and many physical transitions and hence Fermi
[2] called it the (Fermi) golden rule. This rule is often used in spectroscopy to
describe the transition rate between states. Calculations of intensities of spectral
lines and many of cross-sections for various processes are based on the use of this
rule.
9. For large T the area under the central peak is large compared to the other peaks.
Therefore, the transitions to the states within this peak occur mostly. In thisConstant Perturbation 341
case |ωf i| ≤ 2π/T . Suppose, we wish to measure ωf i by measuring Pf i. Then the
uncertainty ∆ω ∼ 2π/T or ∆E ∼ 2π~/T or ∆E ∼ h/T . The energy change ∆E
lasts for a time ∆t = T . Therefore, ∆E∆T ≈ h. This is known as time-energy
uncertainty. If T is small, we have a broader peak in Fig. 14.1 and as a result the
energy is not conserved. On the other hand, if the perturbation is applied for a
very long time, we have a very narrow peak, and approximate energy conservation
is required for a transition with appreciable probability.
10. From Eq. (14.16) we note that the transition probability varies for various states.
In experiments, how do we account for this? If we look at a spectrum we will
notice that the intensity of spectral lines varies − some are very dark while some
are very faint and so on. If the intensity of a line is large then that line corresponds
to a transition which takes place very often, that is, this corresponds to large Pji.

cos(f + i)π = cos(f − i)π = −1, for f + i = odd . (14.25b)

14.4 Harmonic Perturbation
Suppose the perturbation H(1) is a slowly varying harmonic function of time: H(1)(t) =
W(x) e−iωt, where ω is the frequency of the applied force. Assume that the perturbation is
switched on at t = 0 and switched-off at t = T . Following the treatment of previous section,
we have

This expression of Pf i differs from that of the constant perturbation by the term (ωf i − ω).
With this replacement the entire discussion on Pf i of constant perturbation is valid for the
harmonic perturbation.Harmonic Perturbation 343
We now list some of the differences between constant and harmonic perturbations:
1. For constant perturbation Pf i ∝ ωf i whereas for harmonic perturbation it is
∝ ωf i − ω.
2. For constant perturbation Pf i is large when ωf i ≈ 0, that is, Ef ≈ Ei
. For
harmonic perturbation Pf i is large when ωf i − ω ≈ 0, that is, Ef − Ei ≈ ~ω.
Therefore, most of the transitions take place between the states for which Ef −
Ei ≈ ~ω.
3. For constant perturbation Pf i is proportional to sin2
(ωf iT /2). For harmonic per￾turbation we have all frequencies ω. Integration over all frequencies gives Pf i
proportional to T .
14.4.1 Perturbation with Whole Spectrum of Frequencies
In the above we considered the perturbation with a single frequency ω. Suppose the per￾turbation contains a whole spectrum of frequencies ω and the phases of the frequency
components are unrelated. Then the total transition probability is

transition rate for upward and downward transitions are the same.

For the harmonic perturbations sin ωt and cos ωt, the term | · |2
in Eqs. (14.36) and
(14.37b) has an appreciable amplitude only if the denominator of one of the two terms in
it is ≈ 0: ωf i = ±ω or Ef = Ei ± ~ω. Thus, according to first-order perturbation theory for
the harmonic perturbation the system must either absorb or emit a quanta of energy ~ωf i
from the perturbation.
Suppose the system is in the eigenstate φi at t = a (for example at t = −∞ or 0). The
perturbation is switched-on at t = a and left forever. It is desired to know the state at t = b
(for example t = ∞ or T ). In this case af = (1/i~)

final states should correspond to a positive energy electron in Coulomb field of the proton.

14.5 Adiabatic Perturbation
What will happen if a potential changes very slowly? For each differential change in the
potential, a differential change say ǫ is caused in the wave function. But, if the changes take
place at different times, the differential amplitudes contribute with uncorrelated phases.
Then the total change in the probability is P|ǫ|
2 = 0. Hence, the probability associated
with each state remains the same. This is known as adiabatic approximation1
. For example,
consider a pendulum exhibiting oscillation in a vertical plane. Suppose we move the support.
The mode of oscillation of the system change. What will happen if the support is moved very
slowly? The motion of the pendulum relative to the support will be unchanged. That is,
when the perturbation is sufficiently slow then the state of the system remains the same.
This is known as adiabatic process.
14.5.1 Transition Probability
Suppose the perturbation applied to a quantum mechanical system varies slowly with time
and is written as H(1)(t) = W(x)V (t). An example is V (t) = eηt, where 0 < η ≪ 1.
The perturbation is switched-on at t = −∞ and the initial state of the system is φi
. The
perturbation H(1)(t) is assumed small in comparison with E/τ, where E and τ are energy
and time typically characteristic of the system. We wish to find the probability of finding
the system in the state φf at time t. From Eq. (14.8) the evolution equation for transition
amplitude is written as
a˙ f (t) = 1
i~
H

f i V (t) eiωf it

af (t) =

Z t

V (t) eiωf it dt . (14.50)

time interval dt and obtain
af (t) = −
H
(1)
f i V (t)eiωf it
~ωf i
. (14.51)
We require |af | ≪ 1. That is, |H

1According to Max Born and Vladimir Fock [3] a physical system remains in its instantaneous eigenstate
if a given perturbation acting on it is slowly enough and if there is a gap between the eigenvalue and the
rest of the Hamiltonian’s spectrum.Adiabatic Perturbation 347

Since 0 < η ≪ 1 we can neglect η
2
in the above equation. Then Eq. (14.55) becomes the
Eq. (14.53).
The adiabatic approximation is applicable also to scattering processes in cases for which
the number of excited states of the target contributing significantly to the wave function is
limited, and for which the time of traversal of the scattered particle through the region of
interaction is small compared with the period of the target motion excitable in the collision.

14.6 Sudden Approximation
In the previous sections, we assumed that the perturbation is applied during a time interval
T . Suppose a time-independent perturbation is switched-on suddenly at t = t
′ and is left on
forever. This is known as sudden or impulse approximation. In the sudden approximation,
the Hamiltonian of the system is H = H(0) for t < t′ and H = H(0) + λH(1) for t > t′
.
Also, for such problems it is preassumed that the eigenstates of both Hamiltonians H(0)
and H = H(0) + λH(1) are known. Sudden approximation theory has been used in the
study of single and multiple electron losses of high and intermediate energy projectiles in
their collisions with neutral targets, pressure broadening of rotational transitions, core hole
ionization in CO, multielectron transition in complex atoms, collisions of fast multicharged
ions with atoms and in the collisions of charged particles with highly-excited atoms.
What is ψ(t) in the sudden approximation? For t < t′
to get ψ(t) we use H(0) and for
t > t′ we use the Hamiltonian H(0) + λH(1). Usually t
′
is chosen as −∞ or 0 for simplicity.

gives the probability for
the transition from the ith state to the fth state of the perturbed system. An interesting
consequence of sudden approximation is that the system can undergo an adiabatic change
due to the sudden approximation. By adiabatic change we mean a change such that the
perturbed system remains in an energy eigenstate with the same quantum number. That
is, for example, a system may remain in the nth state of the system for t < 0 and t > 0
also. However, for t < 0 it is in the nth state (φ
<
n
) of the unperturbed Hamiltonian while
for t > 0 it is in the nth state (φ

Consider the infinite height potential confining a particle to the region 0 < x < L.
Suppose the right-wall is suddenly moved to the position x = 2L at t = 0. If the system is
in the ground state for t < 0, what is the probability of it being in the ground state of the
new well? What is the probability of it being in the nth state of the new well?

14.7 The Semiclassical Theory of Radiation

is a constant

where ω is the frequency of the radiation. Equilibrium is possible and the laws of thermo￾dynamics are satisfied only for the relation (14.72). In 1920, the coefficients A and B were
calculated.350 Approximation Methods II: Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
Consider two energy levels of an atomic system corresponding to the energies E1 and
E2, E2 > E1. Let N1 and N2 represent the number of atoms per unit volume in levels 1 and
2, respectively. An atom in the lower energy level is excited to E2 by absorbing radiation.
This process can occur only in the presence of radiation. Such a process is known as stimu￾lated absorption or simply absorption. The rate of absorption depends on the density ρ(ω),
associated with the radiation field corresponding to the frequency ω = (E2 − E1)/~. The
rate of absorption is proportional to N1 and also to ρ(ω). Thus, the number of absorption
per unit volume and per unit time is written as Nab = CN1ρ(ω), where C is the coefficient
of proportionality.
On the other hand, when the atom is in an excited state, it can make a transition to
a lower energy state by emitting electromagnetic radiation. There are two different types
of emission process: spontaneous emission and stimulated emission. In the spontaneous
emission, an atom in the excited state emits radiation in the absence of incident radiation.
It is not stimulated by incident radiation but occurs spontaneously. The rate of spontaneous
emission is proportional to the number of atoms in the excited state. Then the number of
spontaneous emissions per unit volume per unit time is given by AN2.
In the stimulated emission, an incident radiation of appropriate frequency induces an
atom in an excited state to emit radiation. For example, a photon of appropriate frequency
can cause emission of a photon with the same energy. This is responsible for the working
of a laser. The rate of transition to the lower energy level is proportional to N2 and ρ(ω).
Thus, the number of stimulated emissions per unit volume and per unit time is BN2ρ(ω). In
recognition of Einstein’s insight the quantities A, B and C are called Einstein coefficients.
The coefficients A and B received important attention in the field of lasers.
At thermal equilibrium, the number of upward transitions must be equal to the number
of downward transitions and so A, B and C are related as
CN1ρ(ω) = AN2 + BN2ρ(ω) (14.73)
From this equation we write
ρ(ω) = A

In statistical mechanics for an ensemble of systems in thermal equilibrium at temperature
T , the average number of systems occupying a state of energy E is proportional to the
Boltzmann factor e−E/(kBT)
, where kB is the Boltzmann constant. We have N1 ∝ e

Knowing A, B and C we are able to calculate spontaneous emission, stimulated emission and
spontaneous absorption. But the Eqs. (14.78) are insufficient to calculate these constants
because we have only two equations for three unknowns. The relation B = C indicates
that stimulated emission is as strong as absorption. That is, in the presence of incident
radiation the probabilities of pumping of electrons into upper states and stimulating the
already excited electron to undergo the downward transition are same. Thus, population
inversion cannot occur in a two level system. The second equation in (14.78) gives the
relation between stimulated and spontaneous emissions.
Suppose we consider an atom in a oscillating electric field E(t) = ˆeE0 cos ωt. The field
is switched-on at t = 0 and switched-off at t = T . ˆe represents the unit vector along the
direction of the applied field. The interaction energy of the electron with the applied field
is given by H(1)(r, t) = qE · r = qE0(ˆe · r) cos ωt, where q represents the magnitude of the
electronic charge.
Let H(0) represents the Hamiltonian of the atomic system and φn denote the eigenfunc￾tions of H(0) belonging to the energy En = ~ωn. Writing
ψ(r, t) = Xan(t)e−iωntφn(r) (14.79)

The transition may be emission or absorption. In the absorption process, Ei < Ef and
ωf i is positive. The radiation field may contain any range of frequencies. However, since
ωf i − ω < ω < ωf i + ω, the term ωf i − ω would vanish or become very small. ωf i − ω ≈ 0
means (Ef − Ei)/~ ≈ ω or Ef = Ei + ~ω. Then the second term in (14.84) is very large
compared to the first term. That is, the second term is the resonance term. We neglect the
first term, the nonresonant term. The neglect of it is called rotating wave approximation,
often noticed in magnetic resonance and laser theory. In the emission process, Ei > Ef and
ωf i is negative. In this case the first term in Eq. (14.84) is dominant352 Approximation Methods II: Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
14.8 Concluding Remarks
In the previous chapter, we were concerned with the theoretical treatment of time￾independent weak perturbation. Because the perturbation is time-independent, the quantum
state of the system is time-independent. As the perturbation is weak its effect is only to
shift the energy eigenvalues by a fraction. Therefore, we developed a theory to compute
corrections to energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. In the case of time-dependent pertur￾bations, the system undergoes transition from one state to another during the action of
the perturbation. Further, once the perturbation is switched-off the system settles to one
of the stationary states. Therefore, we are interested in knowing the probability for the
transition from an initial state to another state. One can numerically solve the equation of
the transition coefficient and compute transition probability when it is difficult to compute
it theoretically. This is described in the last chapter. In the case of adiabatic perturba￾tion where the potential changes slowly with time we obtained a formula for the transition
probability for a transition between the initial and final states. When a time-independent
perturbation is applied to a system suddenly at an instant of time, say, t0 the Hamiltonian
of the perturbed system is time-independent. For t > t0 the perturbed system will be in
one of the stationary states of it. E of nth state of the perturbed and unperturbed systems
are different. Consequently, we are interested in finding the transition probability for the
system to make a transition from an initial state i (state of the unperturbed system for
t < t0) to jth state of the perturbed system for t > t0.

Approximation Methods III: WKB and
Asymptotic Methods
15.1 Introduction
The WKB method is due to Gregor Wentzel, Hendrik Anthony Kramers and Leon Nicolas
Brillouin [1–3]. The method is applicable for slowly varying potentials, that is, the potentials
that change not more than a few wavelengths. This corresponds to states of the systems with
large kinetic energy and hence high quantum number. In other words ~ is small. Therefore,
the approximation is known as semiclassical approximation. The method is useful for esti￾mating eigenfunctions and tunnelling probabilities for smooth potentials or for potentials
with only a few discontinuities. The WKB approximation is a physically intuitive method
and makes many connections with intuition about waves and classical mechanics as well as
with results from the early days of quantum theory as it leads to the Bohr quantization con￾dition. The results obtained by the WKB technique are also obtained employing two other
different methods, namely, the semiclassical path integral and the instanton procedure [4,5].
In the WKB method, solutions on either side of a turning point are matched with a third
solution valid near the turning point. This difficulty is avoided in an asymptotic method of
Keller [6]. We discuss the WKB and the asymptotic methods in this chapter.
15.2 Principle of WKB Method
The method essentially consists of three steps:
1. The eigenfunction is written as a series expansion in the powers of ~. The ap￾proximation breaks down at turning points (E − V (x) = 0).
2. A solution valid near turning points is constructed.
3. The third step is the application of boundary conditions.

The solution of (15.4b) is A = C/√
S′
, where C is an arbitrary constant. Since Eq. (15.4a)
is difficult solve exactly, assume a solution in series as
A = A0 + ~
2A1 + . . . , S = S0 + ~
2S1 + . . . . (15.5)
Using Eq. (15.5) in Eq. (15.4a) and equating the coefficient of ~
0
to zero we get
S

0 = ± [2m(E − V )]1/2

A0 = C/p

now becomes ψ

Since p(x) = p

of Eq. (15.9) is oscillating for the region V < E while for V > E it is an exponential form.
The above approximation is valid only if the series is convergent. That is, ~
2S1 < S0 or

. (15.11)
The WKB approximation is valid in the region of x where the condition (15.11) is satisfied.
For the region nearer to x0 where E − V (x0) = 0, the p(x0) is zero. Thus, the wavelength
λ = h/p(x0) is infinity and hence λ
′ and λ
′′ also become infinity. The point is that the
condition (15.11) is not satisfied near the turning point x0 and the solution (15.9) is not
valid near x0. At one side of the turning points (15.9) become oscillatory and on the other
side, it would be exponential for a potential well. The exponential eigenfunction on onePrinciple of WKB Method 357
side must be connected to the oscillatory eigenfunction on the other side using connecting
formulas.
15.2.2 Solution Near a Turning Point
The solutions of the Schr¨odinger Eq. (15.1) are regular and analytic. To obtain a solution
like (15.9), the Eq. (15.1) is modified slightly so that an exact solution can be constructed.
Assume that x = 0 is the turning point. Writing the Taylor series expansion of E − V
or p

15.2.3 Connection at the Turning Point
The turning point x = 0 separates V (x) into two region. Region-I is with x < 0 and
E > V (x). Region-II is with x > 0 where E < V (x). Suppose a particle of energy E
moves in the potential V (x). Let it approach x = 0 from x1 < 0. Classically at x = 0,
E is V (x = 0) and the kinetic energy is zero. Hence, the velocity is zero and the particle
begins to turn back at x = 0. But in quantum mechanics because of tunnelling there is a
possibility of a particle to be found in the region-II. For this reason, the region-I is called
classical region and the region-II is called nonclassical region. The equations relating the
WKB eigenfunctions in these two regions are called connection formulas.
In the regions-I and II, we write
y1 =
1
~

y2 =

~
Z x
0
p(x
′
) dx
′
, (imaginary), (15.15b)
respectively, so that y1 and y2 increase as x moves away from the turning point. If we
assume the potential near x > 0 is linear then the solutions are
ψ1(x) = A1
p
y1/p J1/3(y1) + B1
p
y1/p J−1/3(y1), x < 0 (15.16a)
ψ2(x) = A2
p
y2/p I1/3(y2) + B2
p
y2/p I−1/3(y2), x > 0 (15.16b)
where I is the Bessel function of imaginary argument. To match ψ1 and ψ2 at x = 0 we
write the solution near x = 0. For x ≈ 0, p
2
is ρx. Then y1 ≈ y2 ≈ (2/3)ρ
1/2
|x|
3/2
. This
condition together with ψ1 ≈ ψ2 at x = 0 leads to A2 = −A1, B1 = B2358 Approximation Methods III: WKB and Asymptotic Methods

using the asymptotic forms of Bessel function. These are given by

In the following we discuss a few applications of WKB method.
15.3.1 Energy Levels of a One-Dimensional Potential Well
For any energy level E of a one-dimensional potential well shown in Fig. 15.1, there are two
turning points x− and x+ such that E−V (x−) = E−V (x+) = 0. Region-II (x− < x < x+) is
classically allowed where the eigenfunction is oscillatory. Regions-I and III are nonclassical
with exponentially decreasing eigenfunctions. The regions-I, II and III where the WKB

WKB (radial) eigenfunction while the principle quantum number counts both radial and
spherical harmonic nodes and we start from 1 instead of 0.
15.3.2 Penetration Probability of a Barrier
The Schr¨odinger equation is solved to find the penetration of a square potential barrier. For a
barrier of complicated shape, the Schr¨odinger equation cannot usually be solved exactly and
the WKB approximation is often suitable for the problem. The WKB method is applied
to obtain a transmission coefficient for penetration through a barrier. Consider a slowly
varying barrier, for example, as shown in Fig. 15.2 and assume that the wave is incident
from left and E < V . The region-III in Fig. 15.2 has transmitted wave alone. Therefore, the
solution of the Schr¨odinger equation is

In the next two subsections, we apply the WKB method to α-decay and cold emission of
electrons from metals.Applications of WKB Method 363
15.3.3 Theory of α-Decay
The stability of a nucleus is explained by the short-range attractive force existing between
the nucleons inside the nucleus. Inside the nuccleus two neutrons and protons combine and
form the α-particle. Since α-particle is a highly stable configuration, it spends an appreciable
fraction of time inside the nucleus before being emitted. How they escape from the forces
binding the nucleus together was explained by Gamow and others as an example of quantum
mechanical penetration of a potential barrier. The existence of such a barrier can be seen
if we look at it from either side. An α-particle incident from outside will be repelled by the
Coulomb field of the nucleus and on the other hand, it is attracted by a strong nuclear force
inside the nucleus.
The potential outside the nucleus arises due to the Coulomb force between the daughter
nuclei with atomic number Z plus the centrifugal force. The form of the potential inside
the nucleus cannot be given in detail. The energy of the α-particle E is always less than
the barrier height. So, the α-particle emission takes place only due to quantum mechanical
tunnelling effect. The inner turning point is assumed as the radius of the daughter nucleus
and the outer turning point r0 is obtained from

15.3.4 Cold Emission of Electrons From Metals
When a strong electric field is applied metals emit electrons even at room temperature. This
phenomenon is called cold emission. In a metal, the electrons are filled up to the Fermi level
as shown in Fig. 15.3. This is the required energy to remove an electron from the Fermi level.
If an external field E is applied then the potential will vary as a function of the distance
from the surface of the metal as shown in Fig. 15.3. The two classical turning points are
z1 = 0 and z2 = W/(eE). We have V (z) = V0 − eEz and
E − V (z) = V0 − eEz − EF = W − eEz . (15.54)

15.4 WKB Quantization with Perturbation
Earlier we have seen the usefulness of a perturbation theory in obtaining correction to
energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for perturbed systems whose unperturbed part is
exactly solvable. In this section, we examine how the quantized energies, En, arising from
the WKB quantization condition change when the exactly solvable potential is modified
slightly. Starting from the WKB phase integral we obtain a formula for first-order correction
to energy. We apply the method to some simple potentials and compare the result with
perturbation theory.
15.4.1 Formula for First-Order Shift in Energy

condition as

En − V (x) dx = (n + cl + cr) π , (15.56)
where cl = cr = 1/4 for linear functions, cl = cr = 1/2 for infinite walls and other choices
for radial and Coulomb-type problems. Let us write V (x) → V (x) + λV ′
(x), where V
′
(x)
is the perturbation part of the potential and the change in the quantized energies up to
first-order correction as En → E

Since E

Even though we have expanded about λ = 0, for a given value of n, In must be independent
of λ since Eq. (15.56) is satisfied always. Therefore, any change in V (x) and in the x± must
be accompanied by a corresponding change in En so as to make In(λ) = In(0). This implies
that dIn/dλ|λ=0 = 0. Then the substitution

15.5 An Asymptotic Method
The WKB method has an intrinsic defect making it inconvenient to use in many situations.
In this method the different expressions for the solution must be used on each side of aAn Asymptotic Method 367
turning point and further they have to be matched to a third expression, which is valid
near the turning point. Consequently, in a problem with two turning points, five different
expressions for the solution must be used and matched to one another. This defect can be
overcome by using one spatially uniform asymptotic representation of the solution instead
of the WKB five-part nonuniform representation. In this section, we present the treatment
of the asymptotic method [6] for the harmonic oscillator potential which can be generalized
to a general potential.
Let us consider the Schr¨odinger equation in the form
ψxx + (E
′ − V
′
(x))ψ = 0 , (15.66)
where E
′ = 2mE/~
2 and V
′
(x) = 2mV (x)/~
2 and V (x) is the potential of the system. For
simplicity we set ~ = 1, m = 1 and ω = 1. For the harmonic oscillator V
′
(x) = x

the Schr¨odinger equation is
ψxx +

E

ψ = 0 . (15.67)
The above equation admits bound state solution only for E′ = (n + 1/2). In this case
ψ(x) = e−x
2/4Hn(x). (15.68)

ψ(x) = φ
−1/2
x
e
−φ
2
x
/4Hn(φn(x)). (15.69)
We substitute Eq. (15.69) in Eq. (15.66) and use the result that Eq. (15.68) obeys Eq. (15.67)
with E′ = n + 1/2. Then Eq. (15.69) is found to satisfy Eq. (15.66) provided

15.6 Concluding Remarks
A novel WKB approach for calculating the life-time of quasi-stationary states in the po￾tential wells of the form V (x) = P(x) − µQ(x) has been suggested [8]. An alternative
formulation of WKB approximation is proposed [9]. An exact quantization rule of the form
Z xb
xa
K(x) dx = (n + 1)π +
Z xb
xa
K′
(x) [φ(x)/φ′
(x)] dx , (15.74)
where K(x) = p
2m(EV (x))/~, xa and xb are two turning points determined by E = V (x)
and φ(x) = (1/ψ)dψ/dx has been proposed [10]. Here n + 1 is the number of the nodes of
φ(x) in the region E ≥ V (x). The second term in (15.74) is found to be independent of the
number of nodes of the wave function. Thus, it is sufficient to make use of the ground state
in computing it. A proper quantization rule of the form R xb
xa
K(x) dx −
R xb
xa
K0(x) dx = nπ,
where n is the number of nodes of ψ(x) has been proposed [11]. Using this rule all the
bound state eigenvalues can be calculated from the ground state energy only. Evaluation of
WKB integral for the special cases (i) n (radial quantum number) → ∞ and l(azimuthal
quantum number)-fixed and (ii) l → ∞ and n-fixed have been discussed in refs. [12,13].

Approximation Methods IV: Variational Approach
16.1 Introduction
In chapters 13 and 14 we focused on perturbation theories for time-independent and time￾dependent perturbations. For time-independent perturbations we obtained first-order and
second-order corrections to energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. For time-dependent per￾turbations we obtained the probability for a system to make a transition from an ith initial
state to fth final state. We have also discussed how to study the effect of adiabatic and
sudden perturbations. In the present chapter, we consider the variational method. The vari￾ational method can be used to construct an approximate ground state eigenfunction. In
some cases the method can be used for finding approximately the energy of first few dis￾crete states of a bound system. The perturbation theory uses a set of unperturbed states
and the perturbation Hamiltonian H(1) to construct the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues
through highly formalized approximations. In contrast, the variational method is based on
a guess for the state – a trial state is used to determine the corresponding energy. Any
well behaved trial state introduced will yield an appropriate energy, although some trial
states will be better than other, but whatever the guess, we can always make systematic
improvements. We can construct a reasonably accurate eigenfunction often by a physical
insight and ingenuity.

16.3 Trial Eigenfunctions for Excited States
Now, we consider the excited states376 Approximation Methods IV: Variational Approach
16.3.1 Trial Eigenfunctions Orthogonal to All Lower Levels
The variational method can also be applied to compute the excited state energy values by
choosing the trial eigenfunctions to be orthogonal to all the lower state eigenfunctions. For
example, if a trial eigenfunction
ψt = ψ − φ0
Z
φ
∗
0ψ dτ (16.29)
is chosen then
Z
φ
∗
0ψt dτ =

∗
0ψ dτ −
Z
φ
∗
0φ0 dτ
Z
φ

0ψ dτ . (16.30)
Since Z
φ
∗
0φ0 dτ = 1 we get R
φ
∗
0ψt dτ = 0. ψt is orthogonal to the ground state eigenfunc￾tions. Hence, the expansion ψt =
Panφn will not contain a0. We obtain
hEti =
Z
ψ
∗
t Hψt dτ =
X∞
n=1
|an|
2En . (16.31)
Therefore,
hEti ≥ X∞
n=1
|an|
2E1
≥ E1 . (16.32)
Therefore, the trial wave function ψt gives an upper limit for the first excited state. Ex￾tending the above, we can prove that if ψt is orthogonal to φi
, i = 0, 1, . . . , n then ψt will
give an upper limit of the (n + 1)th energy eigenvalue.
16.3.2 Finite Basis Set Expansion
A simple procedure for obtaining approximate excited state energies is to expand the trial
wave function ψ using states taken from a known complete set {φn}. The trial wave function
is chosen as linear combination of known functions as
ψ =
Xr
i=1

where ai

i = 0 we
obtain
Xr
j=1
(Hij − ESij ) aj = 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , r . (16.37)
Differentiation of Eq. (16.36) with respect to ai and using ∂E/∂ai = 0 gives the complex
conjugate of Eq. (16.37). Equations (16.37) form a set of r homogeneous linear equations
for the r unknowns ai
. For nontrivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients matrix of
Eq. (16.37) must vanish. That is,

This will give an algebraic equation of degree r in E. If the r roots of E are arranged in
increasing order E0, E1, . . ., Er−1 then E0 will be the ground state energy, E1 will be the
first excited state energy and so on. Substituting these roots in Eq. (16.37) and solving it we
are able determine aj corresponding to each roots. These aj when substituted in Eq. (16.33)
will give the corresponding energy eigenfunction. If the basis chosen as an orthonormal basis
then Sij = δij . Then Eq. (16.38) will become

The accuracy and convergence of the energy values are determined by including one more
function φr+1 to the basis and solving the resulting (r+1) equations. If |En(r)−En(r+1)| is
very small then the convergence is very good. The basis set is expanded till good convergence
is realized.
Although any well-behaved set of basis states may be used to perform the diagonalization
of H, one set is noteworthy. If H is partitioned as H0 + H1, where H1 need not be weak,
then the eigenfunctions of H0 can be chosen as the basis if they are known.

If the first n − 1 eigenfunctions of a particular Hamiltonian are known, write a formal
expression for a variational method trial function that could be used to get the upper limit

Let u1, u2, . . ., un−1 are known eigenfunctions. If φ is any arbitrary trial function then using

Since ψ is orthogonal to the first n − 1 eigenfunctions, it can be used as a trial function for
the n energy level.
16.4 Application to Hydrogen Molecule
As an example for the application of the linear combination method we shall estimate
the ground state energy of the hydrogen molecule. Consider the coordinate system of the
hydrogen molecule as shown in Fig. 16.1.
We assume that the nuclei of the two hydrogen atoms A and B are fixed in space at a
distance R apart. The position of the first electron is given by the position vector r1A with
respect to A and that of the second electron is given by r2B with respect to the second
nuclei B. The Hamiltonian for the hydrogen molecule is given by

If the interaction between the two atoms (H(1)) is ignored then the ground state eigen￾function can be either φ1 = uA(1)uB(2) or φ2 = uA(2)uB(1) when the second electron is

where E0 = −e
2/(2a0). Construct a trial eigenfunction as a linear combination of φ1 and
φ2 as
ψ = a1φ1 + a2φ2 . (16.45)
From Eq. (16.45) the determinantal equation is

It can be proved that

ψA → −ψA. ψS is a symmetric eigenfunction and ψA is antisymmetric. We have not con￾sidered the spin part of the eigenfunction as H does not have spin operators. Since the380 Approximation Methods IV: Variational Approach

The integrals K, J and S can be evaluated. The variational of ES and EA with respect to the
interaction distance R is shown in Fig. 16.2. From this figure we note that the ground state
is a symmetric and bound state. The antisymmetric state has energy greater than that of
two separated hydrogen atoms (2E0) and hence it is not bound. The theoretical equilibrium
bond length Req is found to be 0.77 ˚A. The difference between EA and ES arises since J and
S are not zero. K is the energy of the classical Coulomb electrostatic interaction betweenHydrogen Molecule Ion 381
the electronic charge distribution. For this reason K is called the Coulombic integral. J and
S are due to the fact that ψA and ψS have the terms φ1 and φ2 wherein the position of the
electrons are interchanged. For this reason J is called the exchange integral and S is called
the overlap integral. Though the exchange interaction arises because of the basic Coulomb
interaction, it is purely a quantum mechanical phenomenon which cannot be explained
classically. This exchange interaction is mainly responsible for the binding of atoms into
molecules. It is also responsible for the ordering of spins in ferromagnetic materials.

The evaluation of the integrals (16.61b-d) is not simple as they are two-centre integrals,
since they involve the distance between the point of integration (x, y, z) and two different
fixed points A and B. They are evaluated by a change of coordinate system from the usual
Cartesian or polar coordinates to a new system in which rA and rB appear explicitly. We
choose the new coordinates

16.6 Concluding Remarks
The variational method is sensitive to the trial eigenfunction, because the method does not
tell us how to choose the trial function. In fact, for any arbitrary function we can solve the
equation ∂E/∂ci = 0. In practice we choose the trial function by inspecting the nature of the
potential. In Eq. (16.8) because the lowest-order contribution to Eφ − E0 is of second-order
in the difference φα − φ0, use of any unsophisticated trial eigenfunction which encompasses
the symmetries, boundary conditions, angular momentum properties, etc appropriate to the
system can often give a value of E0 much close to Eφ. It is very difficult and some times
impossible to access the accuracy of the results as E0 is not known. That is, it is impossible
to judge whether the relative error is small enough or not. Therefore, we cannot be sure
whether the chosen trial function is sufficiently accurate.

Scattering Theory
17.1 Introduction
Consider a pond in which water is very still. Suppose a pole is stuck in the pond and is
projecting out of the surface of water. When a small stone is dropped into the pond we
notice ripples. When the ripples reach the pole, secondary waves are generated. We say that
the pole scatters the incident waves. Experimentally, scattering is a process where a particle
(or a system) with a certain energy is sent toward another system (target) and the final
motion of the particle is studied after it interact with the system. When the kinetic energy
is conserved then the scattering is said to be elastic, otherwise inelastic.
Why are we interested in scattering processes? One of the best ways to explore the
structure of particles and the forces between them is to allow them to scatter. This is
practically true at the microscopic level where the systems cannot be seen in the literal
sense and must be probed by indirect ways. A general scattering event is of the form
A1(α1) + A2(α2) + . . . → B1(β1) + B2(β2). . . ,
where {A1, A2, . . . , B1, B2, . . .} are names of the particle and {α1, β1, . . .} are the variables
specifying their states such as spin, momentum, etc. Many of the most important break￾throughs in physics have been made by means of scattering.
There are two different ways of developing the theory of scattering processes in quantum
mechanics. They give the same results but they proceed from different formulations. The
first way is to consider the scattering of a particle as a transition out of an initial state of
given momentum into a final state of different momentum but with the same energy. Let
the time-dependent free particle wave function representing the initial state be ψ
(0)
i
and
that of one of the final states be ψ
(0)
f
. Then using the time-dependent perturbation theory
the probability of finding an incident particle scattered out of the state ψ
(0)
i
into ψ

f
is
obtained from the Fermi formula (see sec. 14.3)

ρf (E), (17.1)
where ρf (E) is the density of states in the neighbourhood of the energy E. The second
approach is to regard the whole process as a scattering of waves by a potential and set up a
differential equation. Its solution will give the scattered wave function. The first approach
is more general while the second is more convenient and we will follow the second approach
in this book.
If the incident particle and the scattered particle have same energy but different direction
of the wave vector k, then it is called elastic scattering. On the other hand, if the incident
particle excites the target nuclei of atoms then the energy of the scattered particle will be
different from that of the incident particle. Such a process is called inelastic scattering.
In inelastic scattering, one has to find the reaction cross-section in addition to scattering
cross-section to obtain the total cross-section.
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172178-17 385386 Scattering Theory
The general idea of scattering is to shoot projectiles at the system (target) under study
and see how these projectiles bounce-off from the target. Historically, scattering has been
used as an important tool for exploring the structure of matter. The search for fundamental
particles is done entirely using scattering experiments. We note that Rutherford discov￾ered the nucleus of the atom via scattering experiments. Some importance of scattering
experiments are as follows:
1. Scattering of nucleons of various energies from a nucleus provides an idea of the
strength and range of nuclear forces and structure of nucleus.
2. Scattering of high energy electrons reveals details about charge distribution in
nucleus.
3. Scattering of neutrons from a nucleus gives magnetic properties of the nucleus.
What is the aim of quantum scattering theory? Our interest in scattering process is to
calculate the probability of certain final states, given the initial state and the Hamiltonian
of the system. The aim of the scattering theory in quantum mechanics is to deduce details
about the force or the interaction responsible for the scattering. The theory achieves this by
establishing a relationship between the cross-section and the wave function of the system.
The wave function is obtained by solving the Schr¨odinger equation. Thus, in a bound state
problem the emphasis is on the energy eigenvalues whereas in the scattering problem the
focus is on the wave function. The quantum mechanical analysis of scattering of particles
deals with calculations of incident, scattered and total wave functions, amplitude of the
scattered wave, phase-shift and differential and total scattering cross-sections.
In this chapter, first we review the classical definition of scattering cross-section and
derive the relation between the scattering cross-sections of centre of mass and laboratory
frame of reference. We establish the relationship between scattering cross-section and the
wave function and introduce scattering amplitude. Then we get a Green’s function for
scattering amplitude and discuss Born’s approximation for scattering amplitude. We present
partial wave analysis of scattering for spherically symmetric systems. Also, we consider the
collisions between identical particles and the case of inelastic scattering.
17.2 Classical Scattering Cross-Section
Consider a scattering process. Suppose a parallel beam of particles of certain energy or
momentum is sent towards a target (often a thin metal foil). The target deflects or scatters
the particles in various directions. The scattered particles diverge. We choose the position
of the target as the origin of the coordinate system (laboratory system). Only a fraction of
the incident particles are scattered and others are transmitted and reflected. The direction
of the scattered particles is described by the polar angles θ and φ as shown in Fig. 17.1.
Suppose call the number of incident particles crossing unit area of cross-section per unit
time as the incident flux Ni
. Let ∆Ns is the number of particles scattered into a small solid
angle dΩ. Evidently, ∆Ns ∝ Ni dΩ. We write
∆Ns =
dσ
dΩNi dΩ , σ =⇒ σ(θ, φ) (17.2)
where dσ/dΩ is the proportionality constant and is called differential scattering cross￾section. dσ/dΩ has units of area/steradian (SI units of solid angle): ∆σ = (dσ/dΩ)/dΩCentre of Mass and Laboratory Coordinates Systems 387

Number of particles scattered through dΩ

Number of particles incident per unit time

It gives nothing but the probability of a particle to be scattered into the angle dΩ. The total
number of particles scattered per unit time is then calculated by integrating Eq. (17.2) over
the range of Ω:
Z
∆Ns dΩ = Z
Ni
dσ
dΩ dΩ dΩ = Ni
Z
dσ dΩ . (17.4)
That is, Ns = Niσ, where σ is called total scattering cross-section. We write σ = Ns/Ni
.
The cross-sectional area of the nucleus is πR2 = 7.07×10−26A2/3
, where R = 1.5×10−15 m
is radius of the nucleus and A is the mass number. For Al27 the cross-sectional area is
0.588×10−28 m2 and for Au197 it is 2.4×10−28 m2
. The nuclear cross-sections are typically
around 10−28 m2
. Cross-sections are often measured in barns (b), where 1 barn = 10−28 m2
.
Cross-sections run from 0 to several 105 barns, but a few barns are typical.
17.3 Centre of Mass and Laboratory Coordinates Systems
Often the scattering cross-section is experimentally measured and compared with the cross￾section derived using theory. There is generally a correction which must be made before the
results of the theory and experiment is compared. This correction arises from the necessity
of taking into account the recoil of target particle.
Let us recall the scattering process. In a laboratory experiment the target is usually
a thin metal foil and a narrow beam of particles is directed to fall on it. The particles
are scattered by nuclei in the target and their number is counted by suitable detectors
kept at various angles. This is shown in Fig. 17.2a. The target is assumed to be stationary
after interaction with the incident particle. However, in reality the target particles will not388 Scattering Theory

FIGURE 17.3

remain stationary, unless they are very massive than the incident particles. It is convenient
to work out the theory of scattering in a frame of reference in which the centre of mass
of the two particles is regarded as the origin with respect to which the coordinates of the
incident particles are defined. Note that the experimental cross-sections are measured with
respect to the laboratory coordinates. Therefore, we transform the theoretically calculated
quantities to the laboratory frame of reference for comparing the results of the theory with
the experimental observation.
When the target particle is in motion after interaction then the scattering angle is defined
as the angle between the initial and the final relative vectors of the positions of the two
particles as depicted in Fig. 17.2b. θL measured in the laboratory frame is different from the
actual scattering angle θC. We must therefore find out the relation between θL and θC and
only then we can transform the expression for the cross-section to the laboratory frame.
The relationship between θL and θC are determined by examining the way in which scat￾tering takes place in a coordinate system moving with the centre of mass of both particles.
An advantage of centre of mass coordinate system is that here the total linear momentum
is zero and two particles always move with equal and opposite momenta.
Figure 17.3a depicts scattering process to an observer in the centre of the mass system.
Here the particles execute opposite courses and the angle between the initial and final
directions of the relative vector is the scattering angle. It is the scattering angle for both
the particles. We define the following:Centre of Mass and Laboratory Coordinates Systems 389
• rL and vL are the position and velocity after scattering of the incident particle
in the laboratory system.
• rC and vC are the position and velocity after scattering of the incident particle
in the centre of the mass system.
• R and V are the position and velocity of the centre of mass in the laboratory
system.
• v0 is the velocity of the incident particle.
At any time rL = R + rC and vL = V + vC as shown in Fig. 17.3b. Since the target
is at rest in the laboratory system the relative velocity of the particle in the laboratory
system is v0 (before scattering). According to conservation of linear momentum we have
m1v0 = m1V + m2V which gives
V =
m1v0

In ABE triangle BE = vC sin θC and AE = vC cos θC. Therefore,
tan θL =

vC cos θC + V
=
sin θC
cos θC + ρ

where ρ = V/vC. Also, vL cos θC = vC cos θL + V. In the centre of mass system

terms of (i) cos θL and (ii) cos θC must be the same. Then

These formulas are nonrelativistic and therefore of no use in particle physics. In relativity,

That is, θL = θC/2.
17.4 Scattering Amplitude
The total scattering cross-section σ = Ns/Ni
is a classical result. Now we ask: What is the
corresponding situation in quantum mechanics? In other words, what is the relation between
σ and the wave function ψ?
Suppose the particles involved in a scattering event are quantum mechanical particles.
They must be described by ψ. The Schr¨odinger equation of the scattering problem is

Spherical wavefront formed by the scattered particles.
We seek solution to (17.19) subjected to the following conditions:
1. Far before scattering ψ represents a homogeneous parallel beam of particles mov￾ing in the positive z-direction. Therefore, ψinc ∼ e
ikz. Generally, ψ is a function
of r, θ, φ. Since particles move along z-direction, ψ is independent of φ.
2. Far after scattering ψ represents particles moving in various directions from the
target. We consider elastic scattering where the kinetic energy (mv2/2) is con￾served. This means that all particles move with the same constant v. Therefore,
at any time the scattered particles form a spherical wave front. This is depicted
in Fig. 17.4. The area of the surface of the sphere increases with r. Consequently,
the probability of finding a particle in a fixed area dA decreases with increase in
r. Thus, we write
ψsca ∼ f(θ, φ)

spherical wave. The general solution of (17.19) is written as

. (17.21)
To determine scattering cross-section σ = Ns/Ni we need to find number of particles scat￾tered through dΩ and number of particles incident per unit time per unit area of cross￾section. These are determined as follows.
For the uniform monochromatic beam of particles of given energy, the incident density
Jinc in the z-direction is evaluated from ψinc ∼ e
ikz as
|Jinc| =
~k
m
. (17.22)
Let the scattered current density be Jsca along the r direction. Consider a solid angle dΩ
in the direction of r, subtended by an area dA. Then the number of particles per unit time
scattered through dA is Jsca · dA. The number of particles passing through dA per second
is ∆Ns = Jsca · dA = r
2Jsca · dΩ. Since the number of such scattered particles will be392 Scattering Theory
proportional to the incident current density Jinc, we write ∆Ns = |Jinc|dσ. From the above
two expressions for ∆Ns we get
r
2Jsca · dΩ = |Jinc|dσ and Jsca · dΩ = Jsca,rdσ , (17.23)
where Jsca,r is the r-component of Jsca. From (17.23) we get

In classical mechanics, collisions of two particles are entirely determined by their veloci￾ties and impact parameter. In quantum mechanics, we cannot consider a path for a particle.

17.5 Green’s Function Approach
It is possible to find a solution for the scattering amplitude by transforming the Schr¨odinger
equation into an integral equation employing Green’s function method.Green’s Function Approach 393
Suppose L be a linear differential operator. If Ly = f(x) then its solution can be obtained
by Green’s function approach. Green’s function is the solution of Ly = δ(x − x
′
). Once the
Green’s function is known then the solution of Ly = f(x) in the interval x ∈ [a, b] is given
by
y(x) = Z b
a
G(x, x′
)f(x
′
) dx
′
. (17.29)
Further, if y0(x) is a solution of Ly = 0 then
y(x) = y0(x) + Z b
a
G(x, x′
)f(x
′
) dx
′
. (17.30)
This can be easily verified by substituting (17.30) in Ly = f(x).

where we have used only G+ as r → ∞, it must give Eq. (17.21) as the solution. The above
equation indicates that the scattered wave is made of spherical waves arising at each point
r
′ of space. The amplitude of each contribution is proportional to U(r
′
)ψ(r
′
), proportional
jointly to the strength of the interaction and the amplitude of ψ at r
′
. All these waves are
combined at r and form the total scattered wave. This is then combined to the incident wave
to produce the total wave function at r. In this sense the Green’s function G+ is thought
of as a propagator carrying the waves from their last point of scattering to the next.

The above equation is not a straight-forward formula to calculate f. Because ψ(r) which
appears in the integral is still not known. However, it provides a very useful approximation
called the Born approximation [1] to be discussed in the next section.
We can use the process of interaction to evaluate ψ(r). If r is replaced by r

The above equation gives the first iterated solution. This process is repeated indefinitely,
resulting an infinite series called Neumann series. If the series converges, then it represents
the solution to the Schr¨odinger equation. The first term in Eq. (17.45) is the incident
beam. The second term represents single scattering by the interacted potential V (r
′
) in the
volume element dτ
′
. The third term represents scattering of the first scattered wave at dτ
′
by interacted potential V (r
′′) at volume dτ
′′. The total effect of such double scattering is
obtained by integrating with respect to τ
′ and τ
′′. The Neumann series will converge rapidly
if the interaction is weak.Born Approximation 395
17.6 Born Approximation
We have seen that ψ can be given in an infinite series. The equation obtained by cutting-off
the series at the nth term is called the nth Born approximation.
17.6.1 First Born Approximation for Scattering Amplitude
Suppose ψ is approximated by a plane wave function eikz. In doing this we assume that the
deviation of ψ from eikz is infinitely small:
g(r) =

ψ − e
ikz
 ≪

e
ikz
 = 1 . (17.46)
Then the first Born approximation for the scattering amplitude is obtained by setting
ψ = eik0z
, where k0 is the magnitude of the vector k0 in the incident direction. We obtain
f(θ, φ) = −

−is·rU dτ , (17.47)
where s = k−k0 and U = U(r). Thus, the scattering amplitude in the Born approximation
is the Fourier transform of the potential apart from the constant factor. This is the first
Born approximation.
From Fig. 17.5 we find s = 2k sin(θ/2). In spherical polar coordinates s · r = sr cos θ.

2. f is always real.
3. ~s = ~(k− k0) is the momentum transfer. f depends on momentum transfer and
not on incident momentum.

if V is spherically symmetric. For a given potential the validity condition can be obtained
by evaluating the above integral.
Born approximation gives good result only when the second integral in the infinite
series is negligibly small. If the energy is sufficiently high, the wave function ψ is a rapidly
oscillating function within the region of interaction, and it can be expected that the integral
will be small because of cancellation of contributions from different parts of the region of
interaction. Hence, although the interaction may be quite strong, the scattered wave is small
and the Born approximation is valid provided the energy is sufficiently high.
17.6.2 Application
Now, we apply the Born approximation to square-well potential and Coulomb potential
systems.
17.6.2.1 Scattering from a Square-Well Potential
An attractive square-well potential is represented by
V (r) = 
−V0, for r ≤ a

mV0a/(~

 ≪ 1. (17.62)
Therefore, a and V0 should be small. In other words, the potential must be weak. Alterna￾tively, if the potential is not weak but the denominator is very large then the above condition
is satisfied and the Born approximation is still applicable. Because ~k is the momentum,
we require the particle momentum should be large. Since momentum is proportional to ve￾locity this is equivalent to saying that the velocity of the incident particle should be large.
Therefore, the Born approximation is valid if either the potential is weak or the velocity
or the momentum of the incident particle is sufficiently large. Substituting k =

the condition (17.62) becomes E ≫ 2~

Born approximation is a high energy approximation.
17.6.2.2 Scattering From a Screened Coulomb Potential
If the nucleus is considered as a point charge and orbital electrons are absent then the
potential energy of an electron at a distance r from the nucleus is V (r) = −Ze2/r. The
effect of an orbital electron is to screen the nucleus from projectiles (electrons). In this case

17.7 Partial Wave Analysis
When the Born approximation is not valid and the potential is spherically symmetric the
partial wave analysis is much useful. In this approximation, a series solution for ψ is writ￾ten. Each term in the solution is called partial wave characterized by a particular angular
momentum.

We assume the solution of the form

independent of φ. Since Eq. (17.70) is a linear equation we write the general solution as
ψ =
X∞
l=0
Rl(r)Yl(θ). (17.72)
The solution corresponding to a particular l is called l-th partial wave. Rl and Yl are
determined by substituting (17.71) in (17.70) and then solving the corresponding differential
equations for them. We get

potential is thus to change the phase of the wave from −lπ/2 to ∆l
. The difference in the
phase is called phase-shift δl
:
δl = kr + ∆l −

kr −
lπ


= ∆l +
lπ
2
. (17.81)
δl
is called the phase-shift in the lth partial wave and it depends on l (or the momentum
of the motion p
l(l + 1)~) and k (or the momentum of the relative motion ~k). It measures
the amount by which Xl,s(r) is displaced in r relative to the Xl,in(r). If V = 0 then (17.78)
and (17.80) are identical. The entire effect of scattering force is therefore described in terms
of the set of phase-shifts. Figure 17.6 shows an example of shift in the phase of the scattered
wave by repulsive and attractive potentials.
In elastic scattering the number of particles per second entering the scattering region
must be equal to the number of particles per second leaving that region. Therefore, the
moduli of the amplitudes of the incoming and outgoing waves must be the same. As a
result, the effect of the potential is only to produce a phase difference between the two waves.
Scattering of quantum particles and the underlying phase-shifts are important in many areas
of atomic physics, including Bose–Einstein condensation, degenerate Fermi gases, frequency
shifts in atomic clocks and magnetically tuned Feshbach resonances [2].

We need to determine Cl
. We compare the above wave function with the wave function
given by Eq. (17.21). For this purpose we express eikz in series form as

ikz = eikr cos θ =

where jl
is spherical Bessel function. Since we are interested in the wave function far
away from the scattering centre, we consider only the asymptotic value of r. Because

We note that the plane wave sin(kr−lπ/2)/(kr) is a superposition of the outgoing spherical
waves ei(kr−lπ/2)/(kr) and the incoming spherical waves e−i(kr−lπ/2)/(kr) converging on
origin. Using the relation sin x = (eix − e

Since eikr and e−ikr are two linearly independent solutions the coefficients of e±ikr must be
identically equal to zero. Equating the coefficients of e−ikr to zero in Eq. (17.87) gives
Cl = il

The significance of the phase-shifts δl(k) can be seen in a different way by rewriting

where Sl(k) = e2iδl(k) and is called scattering coefficient of lth partial wave. In the square￾bracket of (17.91), the first and the second terms represent incoming and outgoing spherical
waves, respectively. The effect of the potential appears in the outgoing spherical wave as
scattering coefficient Sl(k) in each partial wave. The scattering potential can only alter
the outgoing wave. We express fl
in terms of Sl(k) as fl =
1
2ik
(2l + 1)(Sl(k) − 1). We see
from Sl(k) = e2iδl(k)
that the quantity Sl(k) can be generalized to describe inelastic scat￾tering processes (see sec. 17.10). Conservation of probability is then expressed by requiring

This equation is known as optical theorem and is the statement of conservation of probability.
It relates the imaginary part of scattering amplitude at θ = 0 to total scattering cross￾section. Does the optical theorem applicable to Born approximation? Why?
The optical theorem given by Eq. (17.95) is applicable for plane wave. Generalization of
the optical theorem for certain other types of waves has been reported [3–8].
17.7.4 Relation Between δl, V (r) and Xl
To obtain an equation for δl consider the Eqs. (17.76) and (17.79). Multiplying Eq. (17.76)
by Xl,in and Eq. (17.79) by Xl,s and subtracting one from another and then replacing Xl
by rRl result in

An interesting feature is that the phase-shifts are smooth function of energy. Therefore, the
dependence of δl on energy and V (r) can be easily analyzed.
We can use Born approximation to Eq. (17.98) for weak potentials V (r). Such a weak po￾tential causes small or less scattering and therefore approximate Rl,s by Rl,in in Eq. (17.98)
so that
sin δl = −

From Eq. (17.99), we conclude that if the potential is predominantly attractive, then sin δl
is positive and if V (r) is repulsive then sin δl
is negative. The nucleon-nucleon scattering
system exemplifies this quite nicely. From the analysis of nucleon-nucleon scattering ex￾periments, we are able to determine the phase-shifts. For laboratory energies of less than
300 MeV, a particular n-p phase shift is positive implying that the potential experienced by
the n-p system is attractive, but around 300 MeV this phase-shift goes to zero and then for
larger energies it becomes negative. Interpretation of this observation leads to the conclu￾sion that for energies greater than 300 MeV, n-p scattering probe the short range behaviour
of the potential and the negative value of phase-shift means that there is a repulsive core
to the n-p interaction. Hence, for the relevant total angular momentum, the short range
nucleon potential is attractive until a very small core radius rc is reached. For r < rc, the
potential changes from attractive to repulsive. The form of the Eq. (17.92) for total cross￾section suggests that, for a given k, there should be a maximum value of l, say lmax(k) such
that
δl(k) = 0, l > lmax(k). (17.100)
If Eq. (17.100) is not true and if all the δl were nonzero, then Eq. (17.92) would diverge
and become infinity. Therefore,
σ ≈

sin δl
. (17.102)
Even if lmax is as small as 3 the angular distribution obtained from Eq. (17.102) will be
complicated. We can get a rough estimate of lmax using the classical argument. If s is the
impact parameter then the angular momentum is ~ks. Hence, we write p
lmax(lmax + 1) ~ ≈
~ks. That is, p
lmax(lmax + 1) ≈ ks.
For a given range of potential, lmax increases with k. In general, for low energy (small k),
s-wave (l = 0) scattering dominates (isotropic scattering). In n-p scattering with energies
below 10 MeV, the scattering is essentially due to neutrons with l = 0 and the angular
distribution of the scattered neutrons is isotropic in the centre of mass system, and this has
been verified experimentally at low energies.
17.7.5 Scattering Length
We have noticed that for low energy scattering only s-state is important. In this case, from
Eqs. (17.89) and (17.92) we get

The scattering is the result of the modification of the incident wave produced by the poten￾tial energy inside the range of the force. For s-wave, the behaviour of the wave function in
this region is governed by E −V (r) in the Schr¨odinger equation. Consequently, if E is small
compared to V (r), that is, to the depth of the potential well, the scattering is practically
independent of E. The limiting value of f as E approaches zero is called the scattering
length ls:
lim
E→0
f(θ) = −ls . (17.104)
Then σ = 4πl2
s
. If the interaction is weak and the phase-shift is small, then it follows from
the Eqs. (17.103) and (17.104) that limk→0 δ0/k = −ls. Hence, for small energy δ0 = −kls.
17.8 Scattering from a Square-Well System
As an example of partial wave analysis, we analyze the case of the attractive square-well
potential
V (r) = (
−V0, r < a
0, r > a.
(17.105)
This potential can be used as a model to study the scattering of an electron by an atom.
In this case the nuclear attraction is essentially takes place within the atom only.
The radial Eq. (17.76) with Rl = Xl/r and l = 0 is given by
X¨ + (k
2 − U)X = 0 , U =

We write the Eq. (17.106) separately for r < a and r > a:

2X> = 0 , r > a (17.107a)
X¨< + k

. The solutions of (17.107) are
X< = sin k1r , X> = C sin(kr + δ0). (17.108)
The constants C and δ0 must be such that X<, X>, X˙ < and X˙ > are continuous at r = a.
Then X< = X> and X˙ < = X˙ > at r = a give
sin k1a = C sin(ka + δ0), k1 cos k1a = Ck cos(ka + δ0). (17.109)

the scattering cross-section is very large.
The values of V0a
2 given by Eq. (17.113) are the values for which new energy levels with
l = 0 appear. We say that an incident particle that has nearly the correct energy to be
bound by the potential tends to concentrate there and give a large distortion in the wave
function resulting in a large scattering cross-section. Further, σ becomes ∞ for k0a = π/2,
3π/2,. . .. Since it was derived from the assumption that δ0 ≪ k0a, the infinite cross-section
is inadmissible. A detailed analysis gives σmax = 4π/k2
. Such maxima are called resonances.
When tan k0a ≈ k0a (that is k0a ≪ 1) we have σ ≈ 0. If the values of V0 and a are so
chosen that σ is close to zero or minimum for a nonzero potential then no scattering occurs.
This was first observed by Carl Ramsauer in 1921 and is called Ramsauer effect. (Similar
effect was observed a year later by John Sealy and Victor Albert Bailey. This effect is also
known as Ramsauer–Townsend effect). The Ramsauer effect is a very strong evidence for
the wave nature of the electron. It was found in the scattering of electrons from atoms of
noble (rare) gases, such as neon and argon. Rare gas atoms have a closed shell electronic
configuration so that the orbital electrons are fully packed in a well defined spherical region.
The combined electrostatic forces due to the nucleus and the orbital electrons are almost
zero beyond the radius and hence an incident electron realizes a strong attractive potential￾well of finite range. Can Ramsauer effect occur with a repulsive potential? Why?
If the sign of V in (17.105) is changed, we get the low-energy scattering cross-section.
Solution for the corresponding scattering problem is obtained by simply replacing k0 in
Eq. (17.106) to iκ in all the relations. Then we obtain

17.9 Phase-Shift of One-Dimensional Case
The partial wave analysis developed for spherically symmetric system has been formulated
for one-dimensional systems also [9,10]. In the following we outline this.
Far from scattering centre we write
ψscat±(x) = eikx + f(ε)eiεkx
, (17.118)
where ε = x/|x| = ±1. The conventional form of the ψ± with the particle incident on the
potential from left is
ψ =
(
ψ−(x) = eikx + Be
−ikx, x → −∞
ψ+(x) = Ce
ikx, x → ∞.
(17.119)
We write
ψ+(x) = eikx + (C − 1)eikx (17.120)
and identify f(+) = C−1 and f(−) = B. As an analytic function can be uniquely expressed
as a sum of even and odd parts, the general solution of the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger
equation is expanded as
ψ(x) = X
l=0,1
ε
lBl cos 

, (17.121)
where Bl and δl are determined by solving the Schr¨odinger equation and the phases lπ/2
are a matter of convention. Comparison of the coefficients of incoming and outgoing waves
in (17.120) and (17.121) we get
f(ε) = X

17.10 Inelastic Scattering
In this section, we obtain total scattering cross-section for inelastic scattering. A plane
wave can be treated as a partial wave expansion of incoming and outgoing spherical waves
e
±ikr/kr. Due to the scattering object the outgoing spherical waves eikr/r becomes Sle
ikr/r,
where Sl = e2iδl and |Sl
| = 1. For inelastic scattering we write Sl = ηl(k)e2iδl
, where
0 < ηl < 1. There is a loss of flux between the incoming spherical waves and the outgoing
spherical waves due to particle decay, particle capture and the excitation of internal states
of the target.
The integrated radial flux of the incoming part in Eq. (17.91) can be calculated. The
incoming part is written as fe
ikr/r where
f =

17.11 Concluding Remarks
Several advancements have been made both in the theory and experiments of quantum
scattering. For example, using supercomputers a complete solution of the ionization of the
hydrogen atom by collision with an electron was obtained. This interaction is responsible
for the glow of fluorescent lights and for the ion beams that engrave silicon chips [11]. A
quantum scattering theory based on the impact approximation is applied to the level shift
and the spectral line broadening in plasmas [12]. A self-contained discussion of scattering
is presented for the case of central potentials in one space dimension, which facilitates the
understanding of the more complex scattering theory in two and three dimensions [13].
Detection of quantum scattering phase-shifts of individual atoms in a quantum scatterin408 Scattering Theory
experiment using a novel atom interferometer has been reported. By performing an atomic
clock measurement using only the scattered part of wave function of each atom the difference
of the s-wave phase-shifts for the two clock states has been measured [2]. An expression for
the cross-section in the case of non-plane-wave scattering was obtained [14]. For more details
on quantum scattering one may refer to refs.[15–18].

Identical Particles
18.1 Introduction
Two particles are said to be identical when it is not possible to distinguish one particle
from the other particle with their inherent physical properties such as mass, charge, spin,
etc. Study of identical particles is important for two reasons:
1. Many-body systems contain usually identical particles.
2. They give rise quantum mechanical phenomena that have no classical analogues.
In classical mechanics, we can able to know the trajectory of any particle given its initial
position, momentum and the forces acting on it. When we consider a system with two or
more identical particles, in principle, we can distinguish them at any time as each one of
the particles follows a definite predictable path. This is because classical mechanics is a
deterministic theory. For example, when two identical particles collide, we can determine
the paths of these particles after collision as their paths are known before the collision. So,
in classical mechanics, it is possible to distinguish two identical particles. Also, any particle
can be observed without affecting its behaviour.
In quantum mechanics the situation is different because the uncertainty principle does
not allow us to know the initial positions and momenta of the particles with desired accu￾racy. The individual particle is described by a wave packet. Since the wave packet is not
localized and spreading with time, it is impossible to distinguish two identical particles as
their wave functions always overlap at any point in space. Unless the two particles are well
separated with no overlap of their wave functions, quantum identical particles cannot be
distinguishable. In quantum mechanics the finite extent of the wave functions associated
with each identical particle may result in overlapping of these wave functions. This makes
impossible to state the wave function associated with each particle. Thus, a quantum me￾chanical description of a system of identical particles must be formulated in such a way that
the indistinguishability of identical particles is explicitly taken into account [1–3].
18.2 Permutation Symmetry
Quantum theory describes any object at energies below its excitation threshold with four
degrees of freedom. For example, these degrees of freedom could be the coordinate vector
r and its spin σ or the momentum vector p and the helicity. Let us treat the variables
corresponding to an N-particles system as (1, 2, . . . , N). Here 1 corresponds to r1 and σ1
of particle 1 and correspondingly for the other particles. So, the Hamiltonian for a system
of N identical particles is H = H(1, 2, . . . , N) and the wave function of the system is
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172178-18 411412 Identical Particles
ψ = ψ(1, 2, . . . , N). The Hamiltonian H(1, 2, . . . , N) of the N indistinguishable particles is
invariant with respect to all their interchanges or permutations.
Let Pij be the operator that permutes i and j and its eigenvalue be ω. Pij is called the
permutation operator . The effect of the Pij , which interchanges i and j, on an N-particle
wave function is
Pijψ(1, 2, . . . , i, . . . , j, . . . , N) = ψ(1, 2, . . . , j, . . . , i, . . . , N). (18.1)
We have
Pijψ(1, 2, . . . , i, . . . , j, . . . , N) = ψ(1, 2, . . . , j, . . . , i, . . . , N)
= ωψ(1, 2, . . . , i, . . . , j, . . . , N) (18.2)
and
P
2
ijψ(1, 2, . . . , i, . . . , j, . . . , N) = ωPijψ(1, 2, . . . , j, . . . , i, . . . , N)
= ω
2ψ(1, 2, . . . , i, . . . , j, . . . , N), (18.3)
where ω
2 = 1, that is, ω = ±1. So, the eigenvalues of the permutation operator are ±1. Since
the eigenvalues are real, Pij is a Hermitian operator. Because P
2
ij = I we have Pij = P
−1
ij .
Further, Pij is unitary (see the exercise 18.1 at the end of this chapter).
An operator O changes to O′ under the unitary transformation as UOU −1 = O′
. Since
the Hamiltonian H is symmetrical in its arguments (1, 2, . . . , N), because of the indistin￾guishability of identical particles, we write P HP −1 = H. Therefore, for every permutation
operator P H = HP. In fact, for any symmetric operator O(1, 2, . . . , N) we have [P, O] = 0.
It is to be noted that all observables O must be permutation invariant. Why?
The permutation P has the following properties:
1. If ψ(1, 2, . . . , N) is an eigenfunction of H with eigenvalue E then P ψ is also an
eigenstate with the same eigenvalue. This type of degeneracy is called exchange
degeneracy.
2. For every permutation hφ|ψi = hP φ|P ψi.
3. The matrix elements of all observables are same in ψ and P ψ.
The principle of indistinguishability with respect to permutation requires at least one
simultaneous eigenfunction of all the N! exchange operators and H. Let ψ denotes such a
function. Then
Hψ = Eψ, Pijψ = ωijψ, (18.4)
where ωij = ±1. It can be proved that
PijPik = PjkPij = PikPjk (18.5)
for any three different values of i, j and k. Then from Eq. (18.5) we get
ωijωik = ωjkωij = ωikωjk (18.6)
which gives ωij = ωik and ωjk = ωik or ωij = ωik = ωjk. That is, the common eigenfunction
ψ belongs to the same eigenvalue of all the exchange operators. If ωij = 1 then we say that ψ
is symmetric under the interchange of any pair of particles and denote it by ψs(1, 2, . . . , N).
If ωij = −1, ψ is antisymmetric and denote it by ψa(1, 2, . . . , N). We get
Pijψs(1, 2, . . . , i, . . . , j, . . . , N) = ψs(1, 2, . . . , j, . . . , i, . . . , N)
= ψs(1, 2, . . . , i, . . . , j, . . . , N) (18.7)Permutation Symmetry 413
and
Pijψa(1, 2, . . . , i, . . . , j, . . . , N) = ψa(1, 2, . . . , j, . . . , i, . . . , N)
= −ψa(1, 2, . . . , i, . . . , j, . . . , N). (18.8)
For any arbitrary permutation operator P, ψs and ψa satisfy
P ψs = ψs , (18.9a)
P ψa = (−1)P ψa, (−1)P =
(
1, for even permutation
−1, for odd permutation.
(18.9b)
For ψs, every P of the N! elements are assigned the number 1 and for ψa, every even (odd)
element is assigned the number 1 (−1).
The two-particle case is trivial. There is only one permutation operator, P12 (apart from
the identity operator I). For three or more particles, the Pij do not commute with one
another and in addition to ψs and ψa, there are states for which not all Pij are diagonal.
These states are bases functions of higher-dimensional representation of the permutation
group. It is an experimental fact that these states are not realized in nature. Only symmetric
and antisymmetric states are realized in nature.
In consequence, the Hilbert space of N identical particles breaks up into subspaces Hs
and Ha spanned by totally symmetric and antisymmetric states and a remainder unphysical
(N! − 2) states Hr which can be further broken in terms of multi-dimensional irreducible
representations. Since P commutes with H, the symmetric character of a wave function
remains the same in time and cannot be changed by any perturbation because of the prin￾ciple of indistinguishability. As a consequence, Hs and Ha are two disconnected subspaces,
because there would be no observables whatever with the matrix elements between these
subspaces. If a nonstationary state is initially in one subspace, it will stay forever in that
subspace. It is an experimental fact that both subspaces exist in nature. The wave functions
of all the states of a given system of identical particles must have the same symmetry; oth￾erwise, the wave function of a state formally a superposition of states of different symmetry
would be neither symmetrical nor antisymmetrical.
The symmetrical or antisymmetrical property of wave functions depends on the nature
of the particle. This dependence arises from the spin of the particle is given by the spin￾statistics theorem:
The wave functions for any system of N identical particles having half-odd-integer spin
must be antisymmetric under interchange of the labels of any pair of the N particles. No
others are allowed. Correspondingly, the wave functions of any system of N identical, zero￾spin or integer-spin particles must be symmetric under the interchange of the labels of any
pair of the N particles.
This theorem gives the connection between spin and statistics. Due to the principle of in￾distinguishability, the quantum statistics is different from the classical Maxwell–Boltzmann
statistics. According to the above theorem, there are two types of particles, with symmet￾ric and antisymmetric wave functions depending upon their spin. Therefore, we have two
quantum statistics. The statistics of particles with integer spin is known as Bose–Einstein
statistics and that of particles with half-integer spin is known as Fermi–Dirac statistics. Par￾ticles obeying Bose–Einstein statistics are called bosons while those obeying Fermi–Dirac
statistics are referred to as fermions. This correlation between spin and statistics applies
to elementary particles and also to composite particles (such as atoms and nuclei). This is
quite clear since a composite particle composed of fermions will have integral or half-integral
spin as the number of fermions is even or odd. For example, He3
nucleus is fermion as it has414 Identical Particles
two proton and one neutron. α-particle is a boson because it contains two protons and two
neutrons. Examples of fermions are electrons, protons, neutrons, quarks, neutrinos etc. and
examples of bosons are photons, π mesons, 12C nuclei etc.

Also,
Pijψ(1, 2, . . . , i, . . . , j, . . . , k, . . . , N)
= ψ(1, 2, . . . , j, . . . , i, . . . , k, . . . , N) (18.11a)

= ψ(1, 2, . . . , k, . . . , i, . . . , j, . . . , N). (18.11b)
From Eqs. (18.10) and (18.11) we find PijPik = PjkPij . Similarly, it can be proved that
PikPij = PikPjk.
18.3 Symmetric and Antisymmetric Wave Functions

i~
∂
∂tψ(1, 2, . . . , N, t) = H(1, 2, . . . , N)ψ(1, 2, . . . , N, t) (18.12)
gives the wave function ψ(1, 2, . . . , N, t) which is a function of time, the spin and the spatial
coordinates of the N particles. The solution of Eq. (18.12) may or may not have a well￾defined symmetry. Out of all possible solutions, we must choose antisymmetric functions
for fermion systems and symmetric functions for boson systems. We have to construct
symmetric or antisymmetric functions from such unsymmetrized functions.
We know that there are N! solutions to Eq. (18.12) corresponding to same energy eigen￾value as P ψ is also a solution to Eq. (18.12) if ψ is a solution. The sum of all these N!
functions gives the unnormalized symmetric wave function ψs, since the interchange of any
pair of particles changes any one of the component functions into another of them as N!
permutation operators form a group. An antisymmetric unnormalized wave function ψa is
set up by adding all the permuted functions arising from the original solution by means
of an even number of interchanges of pairs of particles and subtracting the sum of all the
permuted functions arising by means of an odd number of interchanges of pairs of particles
in the original solution.
Let us consider, for example, a system of two identical particles. If ψ(1, 2) is a solution
of the Schr¨odinger Eq. (18.12) then P12ψ(1, 2) = ψ(2, 1) is also a solution. Then apart from
the normalizing factors, the symmetric and antisymmetric wave functions are of the form
ψs = A(ψ(1, 2) + ψ(2, 1)), ψa = B(ψ(1, 2) − ψ(2, 1)). (18.13)Symmetric and Antisymmetric Wave Functions 415

The exchange of two particles in ψs does not change the function, whereas the exchange of
two particles in ψa changes the sign of ψa. Hence, for both the symmetric and antisymmetric
total eigenfunctions, ψ

s ψs and ψ

aψa are unchanged under an exchange of the particle.
Therefore, any measurable quantity obtainable from the total eigenfunctions of a system of
identical particles is unaffected by an exchange of the particle labels. The labels 1 and 2
appear in the expressions for ψs and ψa, but this labelling does not violate the requirements
of indistinguishability because the value of any observable obtained from the eigenfunctions
is independent of the assignment of the labels.

The first term is the joint probability distribution for two noninteracting distinguishable
particles. The second term results from the interference between ψs and ψa and is due to
the indistinguishability of identical particles. It should be noted that this interference term
vanishes in the regimes where the two one-particle wave functions do not overlap. That is,
the wave function ψ(1, 2) is different from zero only when the coordinate 1 is in some region
R1, the coordinate 2 is in a region R2, and R1 and R2 have no common domain. Under such
a situation, ψ(1, 2) vanishes whenever 1 is not in R1 and 2 is not in R2. Now, R1 and R2
do not overlap and the interference term is zero everywhere. So, the two identical particles
can be distinguished as the particles are well separated. Hence, for a system of identical
particles, at high energies (E ≫ kBT ) and low concentration, probable number of particles
per quantum state will be very small. Wave functions of the particles are well separated.
The particles can now be distinguished and we can apply the classical statistics instead of
quantum statistics.416 Identical Particles
18.4 The Exclusion Principle
From the analysis of data concerning the energy levels of atom, Pauli in 1925, discovered
his famous exclusion principle:
In a multielectron atom there can never be more than one electron in the same quantum
state.
This principle is applicable not for electron system alone. All fermions follow this principle.
An exact solution of a many-body problem in quantum mechanics cannot be found
directly. It is usually found by using the method of successive approximations. In this
method in the zeroth-order approximation the particles are noninteractive while in the
higher-order approximations the interaction is included through perturbation theory. Hence,
the Hamiltonian in zeroth-order approximation is given as sum of the Hamiltonians of the
separate particles:
H0(1, 2, . . . , N) = H0(1) + H0(2) + . . . + H0(N). (18.17a)
The zeroth-order eigenfunction is the product of one-particle eigenfunctions:

of the functions ψ(1, 2, . . . , N).

. (18.18)
The change in the sign of the function (18.18) under a permutation of any two particles
follows immediately from the change of sign of a determinant when two of its columns are
interchanged.
From (18.18), the Pauli exclusion principle follows. According to the Pauli exclusion
principle, a system of identical fermions cannot be in a state described by a wave function
(18.18) with two single-particle states which are the same. If any of the two single-particle
states among α1, α2, . . . , αN are the same, the determinant vanishes. Thus, on a system of
identical fermions, two- or more-particles cannot be in the same state. For a boson system
(described by symmetric wave function) any number of particles can occupy a single state.
So, the occupation number of bosons in a state n can be 0, 1, 2, . . . whereas it is either 0 or
1 for fermions. Hence, the statistics for bosons and fermions are different and we have two
different quantum statistics: Bose–Einstein statistics for bosons and Fermi–Dirac statistics
for fermions.Spin Eigenfunctions of Two Electrons 417

does not contain the spin operators of the particles in the nonrelativistic limit if no external
applied magnetic field and the spin-orbit interaction is neglected. In this case, we solve the
Schr¨odinger equation and obtain Φ(r1, r2, . . . , rN ). This is the spatial part of the total wave
function. In order to take into account the spin degrees of freedom, the total wave function
is written as a product of Φ and the spin eigenfunction χ(r1, r2, . . . , rN ) as
ψ(1, 2, . . . , N) = Φ(r1, r2, . . . , rN )χ(r1, r2, . . . , rN ) (18.20)
or as a linear combination of such products. The above wave function is the first approxi￾mation when dealing with a system with a Hamiltonian containing spin-orbit interaction.
The symmetry requirements of the wave function with permutations of particles is appli￾cable to the total wave function ψ(1, 2, . . . , N) since a permutation of particles corresponds
to a permutation of both the spatial and the spin variables. The quantum numbers αj , cor￾responding to the wave function of jth particle, contains three space quantum numbers and
one spin quantum number for a three-dimensional case. We can construct symmetric and
antisymmetric wave functions for both the spatial and spin parts of the total wave function.
If both the spatial and spin part of the wave functions are symmetric or antisymmetric then
the total wave function will be symmetric. If they differ in their symmetries then the total
wave function will be antisymmetric. But the total wave function for a system of bosons
must be symmetric and that for a system of fermions must be antisymmetric.
For two systems with angular momentum J1 with eigenstates |j1m1i and J2 with eigen￾states |j2m2i, the combined system with total angular momentum J = J1+J2 is found from
the (2j1 + 1)(2j2 + 1) eigenstates |j1m1i|j2m2i using the Clebsch–Gordan (CG) transfor￾mation matrix. This also holds for the addition of spin angular momenta of two electrons.

eigenstates of these operators are written as |smsi, where s takes the values 1 and 0. ms
takes the values 1, 0, −1 for s = 1 and 0 for s = 0. If s = 0 then the spins are antiparallel
and for s = 1 the two spins are parallel. Thus, there are four eigenkets |smsi in the coupled
representation. We have found in sec. 11.6, the CG transformation matrix between these
two representations for the case j1 = 1/2 and j2 = 1/2. If we consider the two spin degrees
of freedom alone then s1 = j1 = 1/2 and s2 = j2 = 1/2. So, using the CG matrix we obtain
the spin wave function for two electrons in the coupled representation as

18.6 Exchange Interaction
The nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation does not take into account the spin of the particle
as in the nonrelativistic approximation the electrical interaction of the particle does not
depend on their spins. However, there is a peculiar dependence of the energy of the system
on its total spin, due to the principle of indistinguishability of identical particles.
Let us consider a system with two identical particles and with no external interaction.
The inter-particle interaction is spin-independent. The relevant Hamiltonian for such a
system will be
H(r1, r2) = K1(r1) + K2(r2) + V (|r1 − r2|). (18.25)
In the centre of mass coordinates R and r = r1 − r2, Eq. (18.25) becomes
H(r, R) = Hrel(r) + Kcm(R), (18.26)
where
Hrel =

2µ
P
2
rel(r) + V (r), Kcm(R) = 1
2M
P
2
cm(R). (Exchange Interaction 419
Since P12 commutes with H(r1, r2) we have [P12, Kcm] = 0 = [P12, Hrel]. Hence, the eigen￾states of Kcm and Hrel can be either symmetric or antisymmetric under the exchange of
the two particles. The eigenstates of Kcm = eiKcm·R = eiKcm·(r1+r2) are already symmetric
under the interchange of the labels 1 and 2 and thus the symmetry character of the overall
eigenstate of H(r1, r2) is determined by the eigenstates of Hrel. The eigenstates of Hrel(r)
are the products of the spatial and spin states as given by Eq. (18.20).
Suppose that the particles have zero spin. Then, we have only the spatial wave func￾tion Φ(r1, r2) as the spin wave function χ(s1, s2) is absent for such particles. Since spin
zero particle is a boson, the total wave function Φ(r1, r2) must be symmetric. The spatial
eigenstates of Hrel are the usual ψnlm(r, θ, φ). The interchange of two similar particles is
equivalent to the inversion operation with the origin as the centre of the line joining the two
particles. We know that the effect of inversion is to multiply the wave function ψnlm(r, θ, φ)
by (−1)l
. Therefore, for even values of l, the function ψnlm(r, θ, φ) is symmetric with respect
to interchange of the two particles and antisymmetric for odd values of l. The conclusion is
that a system of two identical particles with zero spin can have only an even orbital angular
momentum.
Next, consider a system consisting of two particles of spin- 1
2
(say, two electrons), Then
the complete wave function must be antisymmetric. As given by Eqs. (18.21b) and (18.21d),
the spin wave functions χ(s1, s2) can be either symmetric (the triplet state with s = 1) or
antisymmetric (the singlet state with s = 0), respectively. Since the total wave function must
be antisymmetric, the triplet state ψnlm(r, θ, φ) must be antisymmetric and symmetric for
the singlet state. Hence, for the triplet state l must be odd and even for the singlet state.
So, the antisymmetry requirement leads to l+s = even. That is, l = even, s = 0 (the singlet
state) and l = odd, s = 1 (the triplet state). This is a very important conclusion which will
be applied for the case of He-atom in the next section.
If φα1 and φα2 are the spatial eigenfunctions in the zeroth-order approximation then the
symmetric spacial eigenfunction is given by
Φs(1, 2) = 1
√
2
[φα1
(1)φα2
(2) + φα2
(1)φα1
(2)] (18.28)
and the antisymmetric spatial function is
Φa(1, 2) = 1
√
2
[φα1
(1)φα2
(2) − φα2
(1)φα1
(2)] . (18.29)
Thus, for the singlet state of two electrons, the spatial wave function is given by Eq. (18.28).
Equation (18.29) gives the spatial wave function for the triplet state.
Let us consider a case in which the space variable of the two electrons have almost the
same value. Then φα1
(1) ≈ φα1
(2) and φα2
(1) ≈ φα2
(2). Then we find from Eq. (18.29),
Φa(1, 2) ≈ 0. This shows that when the triplet state electrons are close together then the
probability density will be very small . Since there is almost zero probability of the two
electrons coming closer, the triplet electrons act as if they repel each other. This type of
repulsion does not arise due to their charges. It is due to the spin-orientation of the two
electrons and the requirement of antisymmetric wave functions for fermions system.
√
Symmetric space eigenfunction given by Eq. (18.28) has inverse property as Φs ≈
2φα1
(1)φα2
(2) when φα1
(1) ≈ φα1
(2) and φα2
(1) ≈ φα2
(2). This is twice the average
value of over all space of the probability density of the symmetric wave function Φs(1, 2).
Hence, there is a particularly large chance of finding the two noninteracting electrons close
together if their space eigenfunction is symmetric. Thus, if the spins of the two electrons
are antiparallel and the spin eigenfunction is the antisymmetric singlet (s = 0) then the
two electrons act as if they attract each other since there is a large chance of finding them420 Identical Particles
close together. The requirement that the fermions systems must have antisymmetric wave
functions gives rise a coupling between their spin and space variables. They act as if they
move under the influence of a force whose spin depends on their relative orientation. In other
words, the possible values of the energy of a system of electrons depend on the total spin.
This peculiar interaction arising due to the symmetry requirement is known as exchange
interaction. It is a purely quantum effect which vanishes in the limit of classical mechanics.
Exchange force arises because of the quantum mechanical indistinguishability of identical
particles.
18.7 Excited States of the Helium Atom
In the zeroth-order approximation, the two electrons are in the ground state with the
electronic configuration 1s2
. Both electrons are in the hydrogenic state ψ100. We neglect the
interaction between the two electrons and write its spatial wave function as

(18.30)
with Z = 2 for helium atom. The above wave function is symmetric under permutation
of the spatial coordinates of the two particles. To obtain an antisymmetric wave function,
we multiply (18.30) by the spin antisymmetric wave function χa given by Eq. (18.21d). So,
the ground states of helium-like atoms correspond to states with total spin zero. We have
treated the electron-electron interaction as a perturbation in sec. 16.2 and found the ground
state energy of the helium-like atoms. In this section, we shall consider the excited states
of helium-like atoms.
The space part of the wave function for the case of one of the electrons is in the ground
state (1s) and the other is in an excited state (characterized by nlm) is given by
ψ(1, 2) = 1
√
2
[ψ100(1)ψnlm(2) ± ψnlm(1)ψ100(2)] , (18.31)
where + sign gives symmetric spatial wave function and − sign gives the antisymmetric
spatial wave function. Since the total wave function must be antisymmetric, the symmetric
wave function is associated with the singlet state with the antisymmetric spin wave function
χa. The antisymmetric wave function corresponds to the triplet state with the spin wave
functions χs with electrons having parallel spins. States with antiparallel spins (singlet
states) are called para-states and those with parallel spins (triplet states) are termed as
ortho-states.
The first excited state of helium atom corresponds to the electron configuration 1s12s1
.
The wave functions for the para- and ortho-states are given, respectively, as
Φs(1, 2) = 1

The electron-electron interaction H′ = e
2/|r1−r2| can be considered as a perturbation to the
unperturbed part of the Hamiltonian H0 which has exact solutions. To find the energies of
the ortho- and para-states in the first-order perturbation theory, it is sufficient to determine
hH(1, 2)i in these states. Since ψ100 and ψ200 are hydrogen-like functions corresponding to
energies E1s and E2s of the hydrogen-like atom with n = 1 and n = 2 we get the energy of
the para-state as

The integral I is usually called the Coulomb integral and the integral J is called as exchange
integral. It can be shown that both I and J are positive. So, we find that helium in spin￾singlet state (para-state) lies higher than the helium in spin-triplet state (ortho-state). As
already discussed, in the singlet case the space function is symmetric and the electrons
have a tendency to come close to each other. The effect of the electrostatic repulsion is
more significant, hence, a higher energy results. In the triplet case, the space function is
antisymmetric and the electrons tend to avoid each other. Each configuration splits into the
para-state and the ortho-state with the para-state lying higher. For the ground state, only
para-helium is possible. Similar to 1s11s2
configuration, other configurations like 1s12p1
can
be considered for the excited state. Then also there will be para- and ortho-states, giving
two different energy levels as shown in Fig. 18.1.
Though the spin orientations of the two electrons lead to two different energy levels
for the excited states of helium, it must be remembered that this difference of energy
between the two states occurs only due to Coulombic interactions as the Hamiltonian (18.34)
contains only the Coulombic terms and no spin dependent term. This type of exchange
interaction is called Heisenberg exchange interaction, which is considered to be responsible

for spin-ordering in ferromagnets. Para-helium atoms have no magnetic moment and form
a diamagnetic gas. Ortho-helium atoms have a magnetic moment and form a paramagnetic
gas.
18.8 Collisions Between Identical Particles
Collisions between identical particles are particularly interesting as a direct illustration of
the fundamental differences between classical and quantum mechanics.
Consider the collision of two identical particles in the centre of mass frame as shown in
Fig. 18.2. When the two particles are identical, it is impossible to decide from the observation
of a particle reaching a detector whether it is the incident particle 1 or the recoiling target
particle 2. A detector counts the particles scattered into the direction characterized by the
polar angles (θ, φ). Since the particles 1 and 2 are identical there is no way of deciding
whether a particle recorded by the detector results from a collision event in which particle
1 is scattered in the direction (θ, φ) (Fig. 18.2a) or from a collision process in which particle
2 is scattered in that direction, so that particle 1 is scattered in the opposite direction
(π − θ, φ + π) (Fig. 18.2b).
In classical mechanics, the differential cross-section for scattering in the direction (θ, φ)
is the sum of the differential cross-sections for observation of particle 1 and particle 2 as
the detection does not distinguish the incident and target particles since they are identical.
Therefore, the classical differential scattering cross-section for two identical particles is given
by
dσCM
dΩ = |f(θ, φ)|
2 + |f(π − θ, φ + π)|

where the scattering amplitude is defined by the scattered wave function

We note that the total wave function (product of the spatial and spin part of the wave
function) must be symmetric for bosons and antisymmetric for fermions. As the wave func￾tion (18.40) is asymmetric it must be properly symmetrized with respect to permutations

of identical particles. For example, in the case of two identical spinless bosons, the wave
function must be symmetric under the interchange of the spatial coordinates of two parti￾cles. Now, the interchange of r1 → r2 corresponds to replacing the relative position vector
r = r1 − r2 by −r, which in polar coordinates corresponds to (r, θ, φ) being replaced by
(r, π − θ, φ + π). So, in place of Eq. (18.40) we use
ψS(r → ∞) = eik·r + e−ik·r
′
+ [f(θ, φ) + f(π − θ, φ + π)]eik·r
. (18.41)
This results in a differential cross-section for spinless boson particles

It is important to note that this expression differs from the classical expression (18.39) by
the presence of the third term on the right-side. The third term represents a truly quantum
mechanical effect, which arises due to the interference between the amplitude for scattering
of the projectile and target in the direction (θ, φ).
If the interaction potential is central then f(θ, φ) is independent of φ. Then, we get from
Eq. (18.42),
dσQM
dΩ = |f(θ)|
2 + |f(π − θ)|
2 + 2R.P. [f(θ)f
∗
(π − θ)] (18.43)
so that the scattering is symmetric about the angle θ = π/2 in the centre of mass system,
since the partial wave expansion of the symmetrized scattered amplitude fs(θ) = f(θ) +
f(π − θ) contains only even values of l. Moreover, at θ = π/2,
dσQM
dΩ = 4|f(θ = π/2)|
2
and dσCM
dΩ = 2|f(θ = π/2)|
2
. (18.44)
Hence, the quantum mechanical cross-section is twice as large as the classical result.
If we consider scattering by two spin-1/2 identical fermions, then the total wave function
must be antisymmetric. Since the spin wave function is either symmetric (triplet state) or
antisymmetric (singlet state), the spatial part of the singlet state must be symmetric and
that for the triplet state must be antisymmetric. If we assume that the interaction between
the two fermions is spin independent and central, then for the singlet state the scattering
amplitude is fs = f(θ) + f(π − θ) and for the triplet state the scattering amplitude is
fA = f(θ) − f(π − θ). Therefore, the quantum mechanical scattering cross-sections are
given by

If the incident and target particles are unpolarized (UP) (that is, their spins are randomly

that the differential cross-section is given by

Comparing it with Eq. (18.44), we note that at θ = π/2, the quantum mechanical differential
cross-section is equal to one-half of the classical result.
18.9 Uncertainty Principle for a System of Identical Particles
The uncertainty relation (8.33) is applicable for a system of single particle. Now, we obtain
an uncertainty relation for a system of N identical particles [4]. The Hilbert space H for a
system of our interest is given by

In Eq. (18.55) for each observable there are two terms. The first term is the sum of the
squares of the dispersions in position (momentum) while the second term describes quantum
correlations. When all the quantum covariance functions become zero we recover the usual
uncertainty product.
18.10 Concluding Remarks
The symmetry of the Hamiltonian with respect to permutations of its arguments implies the
existence of a group of transformations on the state function. The permutation group SN
which consists of all permutations of N identical objects has N! elements. Since the states
ψ and P ψ are experimentally indistinguishable, the question arises whether all these N!
states are realized in nature. It can be proved that the exchange operators do not commute
among themselves. We can prove that, in general [Pij , Pkl] 6= 0 and they will commute if the
labels (i, j) both differ from the labels (k, l) and both are identical. Hence, only a limited
set of permutation operators can be diagonalized simultaneously. Due to noncommutivity
of Pij operators, a complete set of common eigenfunctions of all Pij cannot exist.
With reference to Eqs. (18.17) it must be noted that one can speak about the states of
separate particles like φα1
, φα2
, . . . only if the particles do not interact among themselves or
weakly interact among themselves. So, Pauli’s exclusion principle can be formulated only for
weakly interacting system of identical fermions. Further, the function (18.18) characterizes
a state of the system in which different particles are in single-particle states, α1, α2, . . . , αN ,
it is impossible to say just which particle is in each of these states due to the indistinguisha￾bility of identical particles.

Relativistic Quantum Theory
19.1 Introduction
Most of the applications of quantum mechanics are in the realm of the three phases of mat￾ters: gases, liquids and solids. In these cases a nonrelativistic quantum theory is sufficient.
However, in principle, a strictly correct treatment should include relativity. For relativistic
particles, that is, for particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light, the nonrela￾tivistic Schr¨odinger equation is not applicable. Oskar Klein and Walter Gordon1 proposed
a relativistic wave equation for a free particle. Their equation fell into dispute because
the probability density function is not positive definite, thereby preventing the probability
interpretation.
In 1928 Paul Adrian Maurice Dirac (shared Nobel Prize with Erwin Schr¨odinger in
1933) introduced a wave equation for a relativistic electron. His equation is considered
as one of the highest achievements of 20th century physics. The Dirac equation led to a
positive definite probability density function, thereby allowing a probability interpretation
as in the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger theory. It accounted the spin of the electron. That
is, a relativistic electron has the spin property introduced by Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck
[1] in order to explain anomalous Zeeman effect. Further, the Dirac equation accounted
gyromagnetic ratio, magnetic moment and provided satisfactory explanation for the fine
structure of the hydrogen atom. However, the equation predicted the existence of negative
energy states which implied that matter was unstable. There are three unusual features of
the negative energy states:
1. The hydrogen atom spectrum obtained from the Dirac equation has no ground
state.
2. Zitterbewegung (trembling motion): The effect is that the expectation value of the
position of a free particle displays rapid oscillatory motion, that is, the velocity
is not a constant.
3. Klein paradox : For a certain range of incident energy the amplitude of the re￾flected wave from a step potential is larger than the incident wave.
In this chapter, we introduce the relativistic Klein–Gordon and Dirac equations and
present their various features in detail.

Sweden.

19.2 Klein–Gordon Equation
For simplicity, we start with a relativistic free particle.
19.2.1 Construction of Klein–Gordon Equation

H is generalized by considering E2 = p

This is a classical result. The relativistic wave equation is obtained by replacing H and p
by their corresponding operators in Hψ = Eψ. This gives

Right-side of Eq. (19.2) contains a square-root of an operator. We can avoid the square￾root by expanding it in a series which will then contain number of terms of even powers
of ∇ making the equation difficult to solve. So, consider the squared Hamiltonian and the
equation H2ψ = E2ψ. That is,

Only four-component potentials can be added to the KG equation as it will keep the equation
in covariant form.
What is the probability density P in relativistic case? We calculate it in the next sub￾section. The KG equation without mass corresponds to elastic stretching of an isolated
vortex filament in the ideal fluid. The wave function has the meaning of the curve’s position
vector. The mass part of the KG equation describes the rotation of the helical curve about
the screw axis due to the hydrodynamic self-inductor of the bent vortex filament [3]Klein–Gordon Equation 429

Eq. (19.10) becomes the continuity equation
∂ρ
∂t + ∇ · J = 0 . (19.12)
Relativistic J coincides with the nonrelativistic J given by Eq. (2.39). However, ρ is different.
ρ of nonrelativistic particle is positive definite at all points for all times. But ρ given by the
Eq. (19.11a) is negative if E < 0.
Since the values of ψ and ∂ψ/∂t at a given time can be arbitrary, ρ defined by
Eq. (19.11a) can be positive, negative or zero. It is thus impossible to interpret ρ as the
probability density of finding the particles at a point. In the relativistic quantum mechan￾ics, a particle cannot be localized in space within a volume of dimension less than ~/(4mc),
since otherwise the energy of the particle p
2/(2m) will by virtue of the Heisenberg uncer￾tainty principle be larger than 2mc2
, which would suffice for the production of a pair of
particles. So, in relativistic quantum mechanics, we cannot speak of a single particle theory.
The idea of a single particle cannot be retained in relativistic quantum mechanics if there
are interactions which lead to creation and annihilation of pair of particles. Therefore, the
number of particles is not conserved in the relativistic theory. It is thus impossible to trace
at high energies (relativistic region) the motion of a single particle. The total charge is
however conserved. Therefore, ρ given in Eq. (19.11a) is multiplied by the electric charge
e of the particle and is interpreted as volume charge current density. Multiplying (19.11b)
with e will give the electric current density. Then Eq. (19.12) will represent the continuity
equation for charge density. In this case Eq. (19.12) gives the conservation of total charge
as R

Solved Problem 1:
Discuss the nonrelativistic limit of KG equation.
Consider Eq. (19.4) with Ψ(X, t) in place of ψ(X, t). We go over from the relativistic KG
Eq. (19.4) to the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation through the unitary transformation
Ψ(X, t) = ψ(X, t)e−imc2
t/~
. (19.13)
In the nonrelativistic case, the total energy is nearly equal to mc2
. Hence, E = E′ + mc2
,
where E′ ≪ mc2
is the nonrelativistic energy of the particle. Therefore, E′ψ = |i~∂ψ/∂t| ≪
mc2ψ. We can thus write

Using (19.13) and (19.15) in Eq. (19.4) we get the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation for
a free particle. Substituting Eq. (19.14) in (19.11a) we get ρ = ψ
∗ψ which is the probability
density corresponding to the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation. Substituting (19.14) in
(19.11b) gives the nonrelativistic current density.
19.2.3 Spin of Klein–Gordon Equation
To know the spin of the particles described by KG equation we must consider the
transformation laws for the wave function under the original coordinate transforma￾tion x
′
µ =
P
ν Λµν xν and P
µ ΛµνΛµν′ = δνν′ with µ, ν = 1, 2, 3, 4. This trans￾formation does not change the length of a four-vector and corresponds to a rotation
in three-dimensional space, a proper Lorentz transformation, or an inversion. Accord￾ing to the special theory of relativity, the relativistic wave equation must retain its
form under the above transformation. Hence, from the covariant form of the KG equa￾tion it follows that the wave function can be multiplied only by a factor with modu￾lus unity. The wave function of Eq. (19.6) thus transform as ψ(x) → ψ
′
(x
′
) = λψ(x)
with |λ| = 1. λ = 1 if the transformation corresponds to proper rotations (continuous
transformations).
Application of X → X′ = −X, t
′ = t twice will give identical transformation. Hence,
λ
2 = 1, λ = ±1. For λ = 1, ψ(X′
, t′
) = ψ
′
(−X, t) = ψ(X, t) and ψ transforms like a scalar.
For λ = −1, ψ(X′
, t′
) = ψ
′
(−X, t) = −ψ(X, t) and ψ transforms like a pseudo-scalar.
So, the KG wave functions transform like a scalar or a pseudo-scalar under orthogonal
transformation or proper Lorentz transformation. The spin of a particle is determined by
the transformation characteristics of wave functions under coordinate transformations. If a
wave function transforms like a scalar then it describes a particle of spin zero. Thus, the
KG equation describes particles of zero spin like pions and kaons.
19.2.4 Plane Wave Solution
Assume the solution of Eq. (19.4) as ψ(X, t) = f(t)eik·X. Substituting it in Eq. (19.4) leads
to the following differential equation for f:

Note that, E can be negative. Solution of Eq. (19.16) is f(t) = e±iωt. Hence, ψ(X, t) =
e
i(k·X±ωt)
. From this solution we write the wave functions of two kinds for well-defined
values of momentum as
ψ± = ei(k·X±ωt) = ei(p·X±Et)/~
. (19.18)
Substituting (19.18) in the charge density expression we get

Thus, the solutions of the type ψ+ correspond to free motion of a particle with momentum
p and charge e while solutions of the type ψ− correspond to the free motion of a particle
with the opposite sign of the charge.
19.2.5 Inadequacies of KG Equation
When the KG equation was reported many physicists thought that the problem of rela￾tivistic quantum theory of electron was solved. But Dirac did not think so and very much
worried with the negative probability. Some of the inadequacies of the KG equation are:
1. There appears negative energy states. For a free particle E = K.E+P.E = K.E =
1
2mv2 > 0; E cannot be negative. If E < 0 then P = Eψ∗ψ/(mc2
) < 0 but we
require 0 ≤ P ≤ 1.
2. Equation (19.4) is second-order in time. This equation can be solved provided if
ψ and ∂ψ/∂t are known at t = 0. In nonrelativistic case ψ at t = 0 is sufficient
to solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation.
19.3 Dirac Equation for a Free Particle
Dirac set out in seeking for an equation of first-order in t, x, y, z.
19.3.1 Dirac Hamiltonian and Dirac Matrices
Dirac in 1928 proposed the following Hamiltonian for a free particle [4]:
E = H = c α · p + βmc2
, (19.20)
where α and β are to be determined. The corresponding wave equation is
i~
∂ψ
∂t = −i~c (α · ∇) ψ + βmc2ψ (19.21)
which is first-order in space and time. In connection with the Hamiltonian given by
Eq. (19.20), Dirac made the following two assumptions432 Relativistic Quantum Theory
1. For a free particle H should be independent of space and time coordinates; oth￾erwise such terms indicate the presence of forces. Therefore, α and β should not
depend on time.
2. H is linear in p. This implies that α and β must be independent of p. They
should also be independent of space and time coordinates in order to describe a
free particle.
The E given by Eq. (19.20) must satisfy the relativistic energy-momentum relationship
E2 = p
2
c

. Denoting α1, α2 and α3 for αx, αy and αz, respectively, Eq. (19.20)
takes the form
E = c
X
3
i=1
αipi + βmc2

Comparison of E2 = p

4 and (19.23) gives
αiαj + αjαi = 0, i 6= j, αiβ + βαi = 0, α2
i = β
2 = 1 . (19.24)
If αi and αj are nonzero numbers then αiαj + αjαi = 0, i 6= j is not true as numbers do
not anticommute. Similarly, from αiβ +βαi = 0 it is clear that β is not a number. However,
they can be matrices.
Since α
2
i = β
2 = I, the eigenvalues of these matrices are ±1. We write αi = αiI =
αiβ
2 = αiββ. Using the relation αiβ + βαi = 0 we have αi = −βαiβ. Taking trace on both
sides of αi = −βαiβ we get trαi = −trβαiβ. Since the trace of ABC is same as that of
BCA, we get trαi = trαiβ
2 = −trαi which implies trαi = 0. Then because the trace is
the sum of all the eigenvalues, the numbers +1 and −1 must occur same number of times.
Hence, the dimension of the matrices αi and β must be even. If n = 2 then the number of
possible anticommuting matrices are found to be only 3. They are the Pauli matrices:
σ1 =

. (19.25)
But we require four matrices α1, α2, α3 and β. When n = 4 there are four matrices and are
Hermitian satisfying the relations (19.24). They are

When |p| = 0 we have E− = −mc2 and E+ = mc2
. As |p| increases from zero, E+ starts
from mc2 and extends to ∞. On the other hand, E− begins from −mc2 and goes to −∞ as
|p| → ∞. Thus, there are positive and negative energy regions separated by an energy gap
2mc2
. E− to E+ is a forbidden energy gap of width 2mc2
. Since the energy spectra extends
to −∞ there is no ground state.
19.3.6 Determination of Eigenfunctions u(p)
Equations (19.46) are two-coupled linear equations and their solutions are v and w. To solve
them, first, decide whether E+ or E− is to be used in Eqs. (19.46). When E is E+ = mc2
then left-side of Eq. (19.46a) becomes zero. Therefore, choose E = E− for Eq. (19.46a).
Similarly, the choice E = E+ for Eq. (19.46b) is useful. From Eqs. (19.46) for negative
energy states
v = −

w , (19.49a)
and for positive energy states
w =

Earlier, we assumed that u is linear in p. In Eq. (19.49b) if v is a function of p then w will
contain nonlinear terms (that is, power or degree of p is greater than 1) and consequently
u will also have nonlinear terms in p. Therefore, v’s are treated independent of p and can
be a constant. Similarly, in Eq. (19.49a) w’s are constant. We choose the constants as 0,
1 taking note of the presence of the normalization constant N. There are four possible v’s

Remember that the four solutions are solutions of Dirac equation for a free particle.
We may ask: How are the negative energy solutions are to be understood and what is the
reason for the existence of two positive (or negative) energy solutions? The answer to the
second question has been provided by showing that the Dirac equation has spin-1/2 (such
as the electron) so that there are two independent spin orientations for given momentum
and energy. The wave function ψ of Dirac equation has four components while that of the
KG equation has only one component. That is, for Dirac equation more degrees of freedom
are available than the required degrees of freedom to describe the translatory motion. Since
the additional components are absent for the KG equation, we say that it describes particles
of spin zero like π-mesons.
For a free particle we found the energy states which are nondegenerate and there is a
forbidden energy range including the value E = 0. Now, for a particle in a potential V
we ask: What is the situation for a particle in a potential V ? Does degeneracy possible in
nonzero potential? Does E = 0 allowed for a scalar (that is time-independent) potential? Can
we observe energy level crossing? We answer these important questions in latter sections.

Thus, the energy of a free particle in the Dirac’s theory is continuous and ranges from −∞
to ∞ except for a forbidden gap of width 2mc2
.
An energy gap of width 2mc2
exists in the Dirac’s theory of electron. We cannot ignore
the negative energy solutions without giving a physical interpretation. As electron can
undergo a transition from higher energy states to lower energy states, we must consider the
possibility of transitions from E+ to E− energy states. Hence, the negative energy states
cannot be regarded as independent of positive energy states.
An excited state makes a transition to a lower level by emitting a photon. When it is
in its ground state, it cannot make any transition to lower states as there are no further
lower energy states. But in Dirac’s theory there is no lower bound as the allowed negative
energies range from −mc2
to −∞. Therefore, an electron with a positive energy E+ can
make a transition onto the negative energy state E− emitting a γ-ray. Furthermore, once it
reaches a negative energy state, it will continuously lower its energy indefinitely by emitting
photons since there is no lower bound to the negative energy spectrum. Ultimately there
will be no electron in positive energy states at all.
To resolve this difficulty Dirac proposed that all the negative energy states are filled
under normal conditions. The catastrophic transitions mentioned above are then disallowed
because of the Pauli’s exclusion principle. So, the normal state of the vacuum contains of
an infinite density of negative energy electrons. When a negative energy electron from this
Fermi sea is excited into the positive energy states, a hole is left in the sea. This hole allows
another negative-energy electron to make a transition to it, leaving a hole elsewhere in the
sea. In semiconductor physics this hole acts as a positive charged particle.
Dirac considered first the particle as proton. But Julius Robert Oppenheimer and Her￾mann Klaus Hugo Weyl theoretically proved that the particle must have the same mass as
electrons. In 1932 Carl David Anderson discovered in a Wilson cloud chamber of cosmic
rays a track occurring due to a particle of charge +e and mass equal to that of electron.
This was identified as the hole in the Dirac’s theory and is named positron.
The absorption of a photon in the Fermi sea of energy in excess of 2mc2
leads to the
creation of an electron-positron pair. To ensure conservation of energy and momentum,
this event must take place in the presence of a third body carrying away the momDirac Equation for a Free Particle 439
A positive energy electron can fall to this hole and fill the Fermi sea. The decay energy
of this electron-positron annihilation is carried away in two photons. Note that physically
observable positron has positive energy values. For the conservation of momentum and spin,
the positive energy positron will have opposite momentum and spin of the negative energy
electron states. But the helicity σ
′
· p will not change, since the velocity v = c
2p/E as
−E → +E, −p → p will be same for the positive energy positron and negative energy
electron.
With an infinite sea of electrons, Dirac’s theory is no longer the one-particle theory. A
many particle theory of Dirac equation can be obtained using the formulation of quantized
field. Even though the energy spectrum of free KG particle is identical to the free Dirac
particle, it is not possible to construct a sensible hole theory out of KG particles which obey
Bose–Einstein statistics.

By analogy with classical free particle we expect the term linear in t. In Eq. (19.68) the first
two terms of the right-side describe the uniform motion and it corresponds to the classical
dynamics of a free relativistic particle. The last term is a feature of relativistic quantum
mechanics. This term oscillates extremely rapidly with high frequency, ω ∼ mc2/~, (or
period ∼ ~/(mc2
)) and with amplitude ~/(mc) (how?). This high frequency oscillatory or
jittery or trembling motion is called zitterbewegung. The frequency ω is so high that the
deviation from the classical mechanics term c
2pt/H ≈ vt is undetectable. This paradox
arises from the coexistence of particles and antiparticles in Dirac’s theory and that only a
quantum field theory description predicting pair creation and annihilation could cure this
problem. The zitterbewegung has fascinated many physicists [5–7] ever since, because the
spin of the electron can be associated with the orbital angular momentum of the internal
helical motion.
The zitterbewegung amplitude X is equal to the electron Compton wavelength [8] X =
c/ω0 = ~/(mc) = 3.8 × 10−13 m and s = XE0/c = ~/2 and E0 = sω0 = mc2/2. The last
property implies V0 = mc2/2. Further, since the electron is charged, the zitterbewegung
motion generates a magnetic moment of magnitude µ = ecπX2/(2πXc) = eX/2. For more
discussion on zitterbewegung one may refer to ref. [8].
Now, we may ask: Does the zitterbewegung occur only for spin-1/2 particles? Can spin-0
particles exhibit such a phenomenon? What is the cause of zitterbewegung? When does it
vanish? In order to get the answers for these questions zitterbewegung has been examined
for spin-0 particles using the Hamiltonian form of the KG equation [9]. For a spin-0 particle

The last term describes oscillatory motion. If the wave packet contains only positive or only
negative energy waves then the last term vanishes and hence the absence of zitterbewegung.
Thus, the zitterbewegung is caused by the interference between the positive and negative
energy states in the wave packetMinimum Uncertainty Wave Packet 441
The zitterbewegung effect has not been observed experimentally for electrons because
the corresponding frequency of the free electron is ≈ 1020Hz. It was recognized that the
zitterbewegung effect can appear in solids where the electron at the boundary between two
interacting bands obeys the Dirac equation [10–12]. This effect has been studied through
simulations in ultra cold atoms [13], superconductivity [14], a single trapped ion [15,16]
and graphene [17,18]. Zitterbewegung was studied in non-Hermitian photonic waveguide
systems [19] and in Bogoliubov’s system [20]. An optical analog of the effect was found
in a two-dimensional photonic crystal composed by a triangular lattice of the dielectric
cylinders where two bands touch each other forming a double-cone structure with a linear
dispersion [21,22]. The optical zitterbewegung effect was demonstrated by solving Maxwell’s
equations for the electromagnetic pulses propagating through a negative-zero-positive index
metamaterial [23].

above state is nondegenerate. S(x) can be aribtrary, however, it should satisfy the conditions
S(∞) < 0 and S(−∞) > 0. A choice which represents a minimum uncertainty wave packet

In this section, we show that for a Dirac particle orbital angular momentum is not conserved
but the sum of orbital angular momentum and spin angular momentum is conserved.
In the Heisenberg picture, the time evolution of an operator is described by Eq. (7.30).

momentum L is given by

we get
~c (v1w
′
2 − w
′
1v2) = (E1 − E2) v1v2 . (19.98)
Similarly, from Eqs. (19.97b) and (19.97d) we have
~c (v
′
1w2 − w1v
′
2
) = (E1 − E2) w1w2 . (19.99)
Combining of the above two equations gives
~c

dz
(v1w2 − w1v2) = (E1 − E2) ψ

If E1 = E2, that is the eigenstates are degenerate, then
d
dz
(v1w2 − w1v2) = 0 or v1w2 − w1v2 = constant. (19.101)
Because v and w → 0 as |z| → ∞, this constant must be zero. Hence, v1/w1 = v2/w2 from
which we obtain

Equations v1/w1 = v2/w2 and (19.102) imply that ψ1 ∝ ψ2. Thus, they represent the same
state. Therefore, the energy states are nondegenerate irrespective of the potential. Further,
if E1 6= E2 [26],

(E1 − E2)
(v1w2 − w1v2)|

That is, ψ1 and ψ2 are orthogonal. This condition with the nondegeneracy of energy implies
that level crossing cannot occur. When the potential is varied smoothly, for example, by
varying a parameter in it then the energies and wave functions will also vary smoothly. Here
by level crossing we mean that two energies E1 and E2 cross each other. This requires a
singular behaviour of hψ1|ψ2i and is zero for E1 6= E2 and suddenly jumps to a finite value
at E1 = E2. This is not possible when ψ varies smoothly.
19.7 Klein Paradox
The step potential in the relativistic Dirac equation gives rise to the peculiar situation called
Klein paradox [27–29].
19.7.1 Scattering by Step Potential
Let us consider the step potential, Eq. (5.45) and Fig. 5.8. For x < 0 the Dirac equation
is the free particle equation given by Eq. (19.60). For x > 0 the corresponding equation is
obtained by replacing E in Eq. (19.60) (p is a function of E) by E − V0. From the solut446 Relativistic Quantum Theory
for x < 0 the solution for x > 0 is obtained by replacing E by E − V0 since V (x) in x > 0
region is a constant. Let us obtain the solution [28].
The solution of Eq. (19.60) is v<(x) = A

. (19.107b)
To determine R and D we use the boundary conditions: ψ<(0) = ψ>(0) and ψ

′

These conditions lead to A(u+ + Ru−) = Du¯. That is,

We get A(1 + R) = D, Aa(1 − R) = bD. Solving them results in
R =
a − b
a + b
, T =
2a
a + b
. (19.109)
The behaviour of the wave functions given by Eqs. (19.106) and (19.107) depends on
V0. We consider the following cases:
1. E > V0 + mc2
.
2. V0 − mc2 < E < V0 + mc2
.
3. E < V0 − mc2
.
Case 1: E > V0 + mc2
In this case E2 > m2

is positive and hence p is real. Similarly, E − V0 > mc2 or (E − V0)
2 > m2
c
4 or ¯p = [(E −

1/2 > 0. So, ¯p is real. Then in Eq. (19.106) eipx/~ and e−ipx/~
represent incident
wave moving towards positive x-direction and reflected wave moving towards negative x￾direction, respectively. ei¯px/~
in Eq. (19.107) represents transmitted wave, moving in the
positive x-direction in region-II (x > 0). There is no reflected wave in region-II. This
behaviour is similar to the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation for E > V0Klein Paradox 447
Case 2: V0 − mc2 < E < V0 + mc2
In this case (E − V0)
2 < m2
c
4
. Hence, ¯p in Eq. (19.107b) is imaginary. Then

(E − V0)
2 − m2
c
4



i1/2
. (19.110)
The wave in the region-II is an exponentially decaying wave. In the region-I, we have the
right-moving incoming and the left-moving reflected wave. This situation is also similar to
the nonrelativistic case for 0 < E < V0.
Case 3: E < V0 − mc2
We have E −V0 < −mc2 and E −V0 negative. Further, (E −V0)
2 > m2
c
4 and hence ¯p is
real leading to an oscillatory solution in region-II (the solution in the region-I is oscillatory).
In the nonrelativistic case, for E < V0, no such solution is obtained. Furthermore, E − V0 +
mc2
is negative and thus b is negative. We write
|R| =





a − b
a + b





=





a + |b|
a − |b|





> 1 . (19.111)
The paradoxical result is that |R| > 1. The amplitude of the reflected wave is larger than
the incident wave! So, more particles are reflected by the step than the incident on it. This
result was first reported by Oskar Klein. The above situation is called the Klein paradox . In
the nonrelativistic case, for E < V0, there is no oscillatory solution in the potential region
(x > 0) and R is unity. In contrast, in the relativistic case, even when E is much smaller
than V0 we have oscillatory waves in region-II. The occurrence of Klein paradox has been
verified in a numerical simulation [30].
19.7.2 Interpretation of Klein Paradox in Terms of the Hole Theory
The resolution of the problem is associated with pair production [31]. The potential
is strong enough to generate particle-antiparticle pairs from vacuum. That is, multi￾particle phenomenon is interpreted using a simple single particle wave function. As
shown in Fig. 19.1 if E + mc2 < V0 then the positive energy continuum in region￾I contacts with the negative energy continuum in region-II at the boundary. At the
boundary, incident electrons stimulate the vacuum in the region-II, that is, filled by
the negative energy electrons. As a result, negative energy electrons are ejected into
region-I (being observed as positive energy electrons). Holes remaining in region-II
are interpreted as positrons. The incident electrons induce pair creation. Here the re￾flected current becomes larger than the incident current because it consists of reflected
electrons and created ones. The current in the region-II is regarded as the flow of
positrons.
The Klein paradox is treated as the simplest model of the decay of the charge vacuum
in a field creating electron-positron pairs at the potential barrier [32]. Discussion on Klein
paradox using Feynman’s picture of antiparticles as negative energy solutions travelling
backward in time is presented in ref. [28]. Klein paradox was not found for bosons [33].

has been calculated [34]. To obtain negative energy states (holes) to propagate through the
barrier, we require νL > 2m. The potential represents a constant electric field E = −ν in
a finite region of space. After a lengthy calculation involving hypergeometric functions, the

−πmc2/ν which shows the exponentially suppressed tunnelling
typical of quantum phenomena.

R = 0 and T = 1 when 2pa = nπ, where n is an integer. The electron passes through the
barrier without reflection and is called a transmission resonance.
As a becomes very large for fixed mc2
, E and V the quantity pa becomes very large
and sin pa oscillates very rapidly. In this case we average over the phase angle pa using

For a study on relativistic quantum scattering by locally periodic potentials see ref.[36].
Scattering of a low momentum Dirac particle by an arbitrary potential of finite range is also
studied [37]. It has been shown that the amplitude for reflection is 1 and the transmission
amplitude is 0 in general. If the potential supports a half-bound state at momentum k = 0,
this result does not hold. In the case of an asymmetric potential, the transmission coefficient
is found to be nonzero and is 1 for a symmetric potential. For discussions on relativistic
linear harmonic oscillator one may refer to refs. [38–41]. It has been shown that the Klein
paradoxial behaviour can be tested experimentally using electrostatic barriers in single￾and bi-layer graphene [42]. For a quantum simulation of Klein paradox one may refer to the
ref. [43Relativistic Particle in a Box 449
19.8 Relativistic Particle in a Box
In sec. 4.6 the problem of a nonrelativistic particle in a box potential is solved exactly. For
the box of width L described by the equation
V (x) = 
0, 0 < x < L

Now, we consider a relativistic particle in the box potential [44].
19.8.1 Wave Function of a Relativistic Particle
Assume that the mass of the particle is a function of x. We write m(x) = m for 0 < x < L
and M elsewhere, where M is a constant which will be set to ∞ later. Consider the solutions
of the Dirac equation separately in regions I (x < 0), II (0 < x < L) and III (x > L). In
each of these regions the solution is of the form of solution of Dirac’s free particle, since
m(x) is constant in each of them. Inside the well the solution consists of a plane incident
wave and a reflected wave on the walls of the well. Outside the well the solution has one
wave travelling outwards. For a bound solution ψ(x) = 0 in the limit x → ±∞. The wave
functions in the three regions are given by

19.8.2 Relations Between the Constants B and C
To find the relation between the constants B and C and to get the energy eigenvalues use
the boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = L. The boundary condition is that the outward
flux of probability at the walls of the well be zero. It is given by ±(−i)βαxψ = ψ, where
the minus sign is for x = 0 and plus sign for x = L. Let us define ψ¯ = ψ
∗β. Multiplication
of ±(−i)βαxψ = ψ by ψ¯ from left and replacing ψ¯ by ψ
∗β in the left-side of the equation450 Relativistic Quantum Theory
and then using the relation β
2 = 1 we get ±(−i)ψ
∗αxψ = ψψ¯ . The above equation states
that the probability current density at x = 0 and L is ψψ¯ .
The boundary condition at x = 0 gives iβαxψII (0) = ψII (0). That is

result is obtained from the boundary condition at x = L.

To compute the energy eigenvalue we consider the boundary condition at x = L. The
boundary condition together with Eq. (19.117d) gives tan kL = −~k/(mc). For nonrela￾tivistic momentum ~k ≪ mc and P ≈ 0. Then δ ∼ tan−1
(0/(−1)) = π. Substituting δ = π

For D = 1, since l = 0 the value of p is ±(−4Zs2

, that is, p is complex. The bad
news is that imaginary values of p are not permitted and hence the Dirac equation for
the electron in one-dimensional hydrogen atom has no bound state solutions! Although
the potential is attractive, the Dirac equation allows no hydrogen in one-dimension. The
system has solutions in one-dimension but does not provide bound states. This is the case
for D = 2, l = 0. In contrast to the above, bound states exist for nonrelativistic hydrogen
atom in arbitrary dimension. Further, the Schwinger model [46] in quantum field theory
produces bound states! What has caused the failure of relativistic theory? We shall answer
this [47] in the following.
19.9.2 Paradox Resolved
The source of the problem is the Klein paradox [47]. Consider an electron in the central
potential. It is attracted to the centre of the potential and the allowed regions are now
separated by a V-shaped forbidden region. Let the energy of the electron be E¯ = mc2E
where E represents sum of kinetic and potential energies. The Dirac equation has two kinds
of solutions−one in the inner allowed region and the another in the sea restricted to the
outer region.
In the hole theory, a particle from the sea with an energy E¯ is able to penetrate through
the forbidden zone into the central region, leaving a hole in the sea. The hole is pushed
away from the centre of the potential and behaves like an antiparticle. This creation of
pairs discredits the Dirac equation in the case of one-dimensional hydrogen atom. Relativis￾tic equations of motion are single particle equations and they cover only the situations where
pulling of particle−antiparticle pairs out of a vacuum is suppressed. In three-dimensional
hydrogen, a creation of virtual pairs is a higher-order process and therefore the Dirac equa￾tion works well. In contrast, in one-dimensional analysis the creation of pairs is not a small
quantum fluctuation. Single particle equations cannot cope with situations in which par￾ticle creation is a prominent process. Thus, when the Dirac equation says there are no
one-dimensional hydrogen atom, it does not mean that such relativistic bound states are
absent but only means that this equation is not applicable to the problem.
19.10 The Electron in a Field
The vector potential A and the scalar potential φ, form a four-vector Aµ = (A, iφ/c). Now,
the Dirac equation for an electron in an electromagnetic field is obtained by replacing p by
p − eA/c and E by E − eφ, in the equations

This equation is known as Pauli equation and is similar to the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger
equation with the additional term −e~σ · B/(2mc). This term suggests that the electron in
a magnetic field have an extra energy −µ · B = −e~σ · B/(2mc) and behaves as if it has a
magnetic moment µ associated with its spin, namely,
µ =
e~σ
2mc
= µBσ , (19.140)
where µB = e~/(2mc) is called the Bohr magnetron.
The Hamiltonian of the Dirac equation contains, in the nonrelativistic approximation,
a term which takes the intrinsic spin and magnetic properties of the electron into account.
This has been found to be in agreement with experiments. From (19.140) we find µz =
µBσz = (2/~)µBSz. Hence, the ratio of the spin magnetic moment to the spin angular
momentum is equal to e/(mc), which is twice the value obtained for orbital motion.

19.12 Relativistic Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics
In sec. 6.12 we briefly introduced the topic of quaternionic quantum mechanics. The present
section is concerned with relativistic quaternionic quantum mechanics.
Consider a quaternionic wave function ψ = ((i/c)ψ0, ψ) associated with a particle. The
evolution equations for ψ and ψ0 are [48]

and let

Substitution of Eqs. (19.160) and (19.161) in Eq. (19.156a) gives the Dirac equation [49].

neglected then it reduces to the KG equation.
19.13 Concluding Remarks
In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics the central field Hamiltonian commutes with the
orbital angular momentum operator L. But in the relativistic theory we have [H,L] =
−i~c α × p. Using the commutation relations of the Pauli matrices, we can show that for
the spin angular momentum S we have [H, S] = i~c α × p. If we take J = L + S then
[H, J] = 0, that is, the total angular momentum J commutes with the Dirac Hamiltonian
H. Since H is linear in p it does not commute with the ordinary nonrelativistic parity
operator P. From the relations [α, β] = 0, the desired commutation relation is recovered for
a parity operator of the form βP and we obtain [H, βP] = 0. Further, the parity operator
commutes with J.
Quantum simulation [50], semiclassical approach [51] and supersymmetry [52] of Dirac
equation have been reported. Bound states of the Dirac equation for a pseudoscalar linear
plus Coulomb-like potential [53] and solvability of Dirac equation with Lorentz scalar po￾tential [54] and Mie type potentials [55] were investigated. The Dirac equation has been
used to describe the electron transport in graphene [56].
A quasi-relativistic wave equation the solutions of which match with those of nonrela￾tivistic quantum mechanics for slow moving particles and valid for particles with relativistic
speeds is introduced and studied [57–61]. A relativistic non-Hermitian quantum mechanics
is developed [62].Bibliography 457

Mysteries in Quantum Mechanics
20.1 Introduction
Quantum theory is considered as the most successful scientific theory of all time. However,
the understanding1 and interpretation of quantum theory has been subjected to a continuous
debate since its formulation. A leading role was played by Einstein in the development of
the old quantum theory but he was not impressed by the statistical interpretation of the
quantum theory. He believed in a world of well defined law and order in which objectivity
exists. He never thought that the new quantum theory as a complete theory. In 1926 in a
letter to Max Born, Einstein wrote: Quantum mechanics is very impressive. ... The theory
produces good deal but hardly brings us closer to the secret of the old one. I am at all events
convinced that God does not play dice.
In the beginning, gedankan2
(thought) experiments were used to analyze fundamental
issues in quantum mechanics. At the end of 20th century, the situation had changed and
real experiments were performed. Bohr and Einstein sparred to explain certain gedankan
experiments each using very different concepts like causality. The realization of a controversy
between quantum mechanics and reasonable assumptions was pointed out by Einstein, Boris
Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (EPR) in 1935. Even though their argument is opposite to
quantum mechanical results, it contains a truth. David Bohm called the EPR argument a
paradox . The essence of their criticism is that Schr¨odinger wave function must be considered
as describing an ensemble of systems and cannot attached to be the state of any individual
system.
It was John Stewart Bell (1964), an Irish physicist, established what the quantum theory
can tell us about the nature of the world. Bell formulated certain inequalities based on the
arguments of EPR. They should be valid for any theory satisfying the notions of reality and
locality. The striking news is that the Bell’s inequality is violated by quantum mechanics
but the experimental results agree with the predictions of quantum theory.
In the present chapter, we present the Schr¨odinger cat paradox and Bohm’s version
of EPR paradox. We give a brief sketch of Bell’s inequality and the quantum mechanical
examples violating it.

In connection with the understanding of quantum mechanics Feynman once said: There was a time
when the newspapers said that only twelve men understood the theory of relativity. I do not believe there
ever was such a time. ... I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics [R.P. Feynman
(1965), The Character of Physical Law 129. BBC/Penguin].
2A gedankan experiment is a thought experiment which may be imagined, technically not feasible but
consistent with the laws of physics.

20.2 The Collapse of the Wave Function
According to Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, the state of a microscopic
system is defined as ψ = a1ψ1 + a2ψ2 + . . .. When a measurement is performed, ψ collapses
into any one of the states ψ1, ψ2, . . ., with respective probabilities |a1|
2
, |a2|
2
, . . .. This
collapse of the wave function occurs in an unpredictable way.
Consider a simple radioactive nucleus emitting an electron in the decay process. The
possible outcomes of the experiment will be either the undecayed nucleus or decayed nucleus.
Before the measurement, ψ of the state of the nuclei is audψud + adψd, where ψud is the
undecayed state and ψd is the decayed state wave functions. At any particular time |aud|
2
and |ad|
2 are the probabilities of it has not decayed and decayed, respectively. In the actual
measurement, we will find either ψd or ψud. No measurement will yield a partially decayed
state. The measurement thus caused a discontinuous change of wave function from audψud+
adψd to ψud or ψd. This quantum jump phenomenon is called the collapse of the wave
function.
As the decay of the nuclei is a random process, the emitted electron will travel in any
direction with equal probability so it can be represented by a spherical de Broglie wave
spreading out from the source. Consider a spherical surface of area S = S
′ +S
′′, where S
′
is
the area of an electron detector and S
′′ is the remaining area of the spherical surface. Since
the total probability of detecting the electron in the total spherical surface is one, we write
Z
S
ψψ∗ dV =
Z
S′
ψψ∗ dV +
Z
S′′
ψψ∗ dV = 1 . (20.1)
Hence, before an experiment is performed to detect the electron, the probability of detection
is R
S′ ψψ∗ dV = S
′/S. The probability for nondetection is R
S′′ ψψ∗ dV = S
′′/S. At a later
moment if the detector has detected an electron then the conditions will be R
S′ ψψ∗ dV = 1
and R
S′′ ψψ∗ dV = 0. If the detector has not recorded the electron then R
S′ ψψ∗ dV = 0 and
R
S′′ ψψ∗ dV = 1.
The discontinuous collapse of the wave function is similar to what happens when the
atom decays. Consider the case when the electron is detected. Before the detection of the
electron, ψ is spread over a sphere centred on the nucleus. When the wave function collapses,
it has to happen everywhere on the sphere. So, the probability of detecting the electron
changes suddenly everywhere except at the detector from a finite value to 0. At the detector
the probability changes from a small value to a large value at the same instant. Detecting
the electron at one place has had an instantaneous effect on the wave function at all other
places. This strange action-at-a-distance is called nonlocality. These examples show how
quantum theory entangles the measuring apparatus of the observer in the experiment. The
process of detection by the observer has made the probability of detection elsewhere 0.
Hence, it is difficult to separate an objective physical reality from the experimental set up.
Let us point out the essentials of Einstein’s dissatisfaction with quantum theory [1]. In
connection with the above mentioned decay process, we ask: what is the time of decay?
The quantum theory does not provide the actual time of decay, but only gives the various
possible decay times and their corresponding probabilities. Einstein asked the following:
Can this theoretical description be taken as the complete description of the disintegration of
a single atom? The answer is no. An atom decays at a definite time, but such a definite
time-value is not specified by the wave function ψ. Thus, the description of the individual
atom by the wave function is incomplete. The wave function is to be taken as a description,
but of an ensemble of systems.Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) Paradox 463

20.3 Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) Paradox
To argue that quantum theory is incomplete in describing the physical reality, EPR for￾mulated a thought experiment. In the following we briefly present the US physicist David
Bohm’s version of EPR experiment, EPR’s arguments and the replies of John von Neumann
and Bohr [2,3].
Consider a molecule with two identical atoms. The total spin of the molecule is zero
and the spin of each atom is ~/2. Suppose the molecule is split into two atoms conserving
the total angular momentum. Each atom travels in opposite directions. Because the total
angular momentum is unchanged if we measure the spin of the atom-1 in some direction
then the spin of the atom-2 must be in the opposite direction as shown in Fig. 20.1.
We recall that spinning property of an atom cannot be described in classical terms. That
is, the axis of rotation cannot always be defined with certainty. The act of measurement
gives the atom a particular axis of rotation. But before the measurement, it cannot be
said to spin about a well defined axis. Suppose each atom has the z-component of its spin
measured by a Stern–Gerlach apparatus as in Fig. 20.2. The source S sends the atoms 1 and
2 to the vertically oriented magnets P1 and P2, respectively. Here P stands for polarization.

20.3.1 Total Wave Function: An Entangled State
The atom-1 has a wave function φ
1
. It is an eigenvector of the operator P1. Similarly, the
wave function of atom-2 is, say, φ
2
. For spin-up and spin-down use the subscripts + and −,
respectively. The corresponding eigenvalues are chosen as +1 and −1. Then we have
atom-1 − spin-up : P1φ
1
+ = φ
1
+ , (20.2a)
atom-1 − spin-down : P1φ

− = −φ

− , (20.2b)
atom-2 − spin-up : P2φ

+ = φ
2
+ , (20.2c)
atom-2 − spin-down : P2φ
2
− = −φ
2
− . (20.2d)
We know that either atom-1 has spin-up and atom-2 has its spin-down or versa, without
knowing which of these two possible states the system has. In such a case the experimental
properties are compatible with the idea of the particles possess individual properties but
are unknown to us. Suppose we perform superpositions of product states as

The minus sign is because the total spin is zero. Here ψ is nonlocal, describes both particles
together, even if they are far apart. In ψ1,2 specific state is not assigned to any of the
particles individually. The point is that a measurement on one particle would collapse the
wave function to a definite state of the particles. Schr¨odinger called such states as entangled
states3
[4,5]. The entanglement refers to the quantum description of an ensemble of systems
where every system consists of at least-two more subsystems and disallow us to assign a
definite quantum state to each of the individual subsystems. What is unique about the
entangled state? Assigning a state to each particle in individually is not possible. In other
words, the individual particles are regarded as not possessing properties in their own.
Another example of entangled states is the following. Let us consider a process of con￾verting a single ultraviolet photon into two red photons using a nonlinear crystal [6] with
energy and momentum conservations. In a coordinate system assume that the photons have
equal and opposite momenta. We place slits so that photon-1 can be in one of the two states,
a or b, and photon-2 is either in a
′ or b
′
. Since we do not know the state of the created
photon, we have an entangled state
ψ ∝ ψ1(a)ψ2(a
′
) + ψ1(b)ψ2(b
′
). (20.4)
We note that entanglement is one of the most striking aspects of quantum mechanics.
In classical physics, two interacting systems retain their individuality during the interaction
process and independent of each other if their coupling is removed. In contrast, a different
behaviour is realized in quantum theory. When two quantum systems interact then their
identities become entangled. Further, as a result a state vector description of each system
is precluded. The state vector of the composite system is inseparable into a product of the
states of the subsystems. The entanglement is preserved even after removing the interaction.
Consequently, a measurement on one system will affect the other. Entanglement has been
confirmed experimentally [7–10]. Manifestation of entanglement in macroscopic properties
of a system is noticed in an experiment by Ghosh et al. [11]. They considered an insulating
magnetic salt LiHOxY1−xF4, which is formed by random substitution of magnetic HO3+
ions in place of nonmagnetic Y3+ with probability x. The magnetic specific heat and mag￾netic susceptibility of a single-crystal specimen of the salt as a function of temperature is
3Schr¨odinger coined the word entanglement in 1935 in a three-part paper on the ‘Present Situation in
Quantum Mechanics’ (E. Schr¨odinger, Die Naturwissenschaften 48:807, 1935; 49:823, 844, 1935)Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) Paradox 465
experimentally determined. The numerical simulations agreed with the experimental result
only when the entanglement between the magnetic spins is taken into account.
An application of entanglement is the quantum computers which could allow an ex￾ponential increase of computational speed for certain problems such as for example, the
factorization of large numbers into primes [12,13]. Quantum entanglement allows to trans￾fer an unknown quantum state of a two-level system from one particle to another distinct
particle without actually sending the particle itself. Many other applications of entangle￾ment are now being developed and investigated, for example, in frequency standards [14],
distributed quantum computation [15,16], multiparticle swapping [17] and multi-particle
entanglement purification [18].

20.3.3 EPR Argument
By measuring the spin of atom-1 we can determine the spin of atom-2 without carrying
out a measurement on atom-2. If atom-1 is spin-up about some axis then atom-2 must be
spin-down about the same axis. Since the two atoms are noninteracting the spin of atom-2
before and after the measurement of atom-1 must be identical. But, quantum theory denies
this information and is unable to give the spin of atom-2 before the measurement of it.
According to quantum theory a property of atom-2 is known only if the measurement is
performed on it.
The significance of the EPR argument is that it was against quantum mechanics with the
principles of locality and reality. The principle of locality implies that the actual situation
of atom-2 is independent of what is done with the spatially separated atom-1. EPR pointed
out that in a complete theory every element of physical reality must have a correspond￾ing counterpart. Quantum theory does not have this one to one correspondence between
reality and theory. This is because it not determines individual events but determine only
probabilities of the possible events. EPR proposed that if without disturbing a system, we
are able to determine certainly the value of an observable then there exists an element of
physical reality to this observable. According to locality, a change recorded by P1 is due to
the change in the orientation of P1 and independent of the orientation of spatially separated
P2.
As per the above, the spin S1(S2) of atom-1(2) can be found definitely without disturbing
atom-2(1). Therefore, S1 and S2 are elements of reality. But here if S1 is known then S2
is also known (without a measurement on atom-2). In this sense the principles of locality
and reality are violated and hence the quantum mechanical description is incomplete. In
quantum mechanics individual events are thought of simply chance happening and for each
individual events there are no corresponding theoretical elements. Then according to EPR,
quantum theory is not complete. This is the crux of the EPR argument. EPR did not doubt
the correctness of predictions of quantum theory. They were concerned in calling quantum
theory as complete theory.
We will consider another example of EPR experiment. As per the conservation of linear
momentum, if two particles A and B are emitted in opposite directions, then the magnitude
of momenta of A and B must be equal. Thus, a measurement on A or B determines linear
momentum of both even though they are separated and no interaction between them. If
the linear momentum of A is measured accurately then the linear momentum of B is also
known accurately. Now, the position of B can be measured with desired precision and
hence that of A can also be known without measurement on A. Since the position and
momentum of both A and B have been obtained accurately the uncertainty principle is
violated. If this is possible then the position and momentum of A and B are elements
of physical reality. But the wave function will not give simultaneously the position and
momentum. Hence, according to EPR argument, the wave function does not provide a
complete description of physical reality. EPR thought that there were hidden variables
and their ignorance disallowed us in making exact predictions. These hidden variables are
nonlocal. But Bohr strongly disagreed with EPR’s argument.
20.3.4 John von Neumann’s and Bohr’s Reply to EPR
According to von Neumann a measurement of Sz on atom-1 makes the state vector to
collapse to φ
1
+φ
2
− or φ
1
−φ
2
+. Therefore, if the Sz of atom-1 is measured as ~/2 then that
of atom-2 will be −~/2 and vice-versa. Both spins now acquired definite values of Sz. The
measurement led an instantaneous effect on the spins of atoms 1 and 2 even though they
are spatially separated.Hidden Variables 467
Bohr pointed out that measurements on quantum systems are not like classical mea￾surements. Their results depend on the experimental arrangement which is not local in this
sense. The spin of atom-2 is determined with a measurement on it but by the experiment
on atom-1. This possibility is because the spin of atom-1 and the spin of atom-2 will have
exactly the opposite sign. Further, he argued that, more importantly, the two atoms system
is an indivisible even the particles are separated. The system cannot be studied in terms
of independent parts. They have instantaneous and nonlocal connections. They are beyond
our usual notions of information transfer.
20.4 Hidden Variables
EPR argued that the quantum theory is incomplete. But any method for completing it was
not known. EPR arguments raised an intriguing question of whether there is a more refined
description of nature than that of quantum mechanics in explaining the action-at-distance.
It was proposed that classical-like determinism can be recovered in quantum mechanics by
hidden variables. They are assigned to observables before measurement. An average over
them gives the statistical values determined by quantum mechanics. Effectively, the hidden
variables make the probabilistic nature of the individual system as a system of ensembles
of individuals. If we specify the hidden parameters then we can arrive a classical physics
type of theory where there would be no uncertainties. As these variables are not realized in
actual experiments, they have been named hidden variables.
Even before the EPR paper, von Neumann in 1932 shown that hidden variable could
not yield the same results as quantum theory. His proof pointed out that hidden variables
theories are not useful to complete the quantum theory. The correctness of the proof was
questioned. In 1952, David Bohm developed a hidden variables theory and its predictions
were in agreement with quantum results. He shown that a hidden variables theory would
be able to produce the results of conventional theory and retain the reality of quantum
objects. But his model had built-in nonlocality and needed influences to travel faster than
the speed of light, thus violating the theory of relativity. In 1964, John Stewart Bell identified
the breakdown of proof of von Neumann. He established that the predictions of quantum
theory are in agreement with observation while those of hidden variables theories are not.
20.5 The Paradox of Schrodinger’s Cat ¨
Let us ask the following question: Why do we not realize quantum superposition of classical
objects? To answer this let us brief the famous thought experiment of Schr¨odinger (1935):
The paradox of Schr¨odinger cat [19,20]. This paradox was introduced by Schr¨odinger when
he was not satisfied by the superposition of unobserved states and the discontinuous collapse
of the wave function.
Suppose a cat is placed inside a sealed container. Inside it there is a device which can
be triggered by a quantum event. If the event happens then the device releases, say poison
gas and the cat is killed. The experimental set up is shown in Fig. 20.3. The quantum event
is, for example, triggering of a photo-cell by a photon. The photon is emitted by a light
source and then reflected-off a half-silvered mirror (it is a mirror which reflects exactly half
of the incident light and the remaining half is transmitted directly through the mirror). At468 Mysteries in Quantum Mechanics
FIGURE 20.3
Set up of Schr¨odinger cat experiment.
the mirror the photon is splitted into two parts. One is reflected while the second is focused
on a photo cell. When a photon is registered, the gas is released and the cat is killed. If the
photon is not registered then it is assumed to be transmitted and the cat is alive.
In the experiment, either the photon is registered and the cat is killed or the photon is not
registered (that is, transmitted) and the cat is saved. Any one of the above two events must
take place. The probability of each event is 1/2 because the mirror is half-silvered. Before
the measurement, the wave function for the event contains two parts with the amplitude of
each part as 1/
√
2 . The wave function must contain both possibilities-dead and alive with
equal probabilities. That is, the cat is in a linear superposition of being dead and alive:
|ψi =
1
√
2
(|deadi + |alivei) . (20.13)
When the observation is made the wave function of the cat collapses into dead or alive.
What does the observer inside the container predict? For him the wave function of the cat
collapsed much earlier than the outside observer and the above linear combination has no
relevance. But for an outside observer the cat is partially alive and partially dead until he
performs the measurement. That is, two different states are assigned to the same reality.
Quantum mechanics says nothing about any individual events but gives all the possibil￾ities. It does not say that before measurement the cat is half-dead and half-alive. When the
observer looks to find the state of the cat, there is no implication in quantum mechanics
that the death of the cat is caused by seeing. Essentially, the wave function is not a physical
attribute of the cat.
To Einstein the collapse postulate was precious retreat from realism. It implied that
physical quantities have no values until they are observed. This suggests that in the absence
of an observer there might be no real world. With this view in mind Einstein asked: Is the
moon there when nobody looks? [21]. Einstein believed that an objective reality exists in
nature.Bell’s Theorem 469
20.6 Bell’s Theorem
Three decades later the EPR experiment, in 1964 John Bell derived a theorem [22] which
proved that the existence of local hidden variables is inconsistent with the predictions
of quantum theory. Experiments supported Bell’s prediction and agreed with quantum
mechanical predictions. Now, it appears that local hidden variables theories are incapable
and the principle of locality does not hold. In the following we present d’Espagnat’s [23]
generalization of the proof of Bell’s theorem. Its simplified version is given by Harrison [3].
The derivation only involves logic. We follow the description in [3].
Consider a set of macroscopic objects characterized by three two-valued parameters a,
b and c. Table 20.1 gives examples of such objects. Let us call these parameters as hidden
variables on each object. We assume that the hidden variables are assigned to each object
remain unchanged. Further, we do not assume anything about the probabilities of the values
of the hidden variables. Assign the + symbol for the properties in the first row of table 20.1
and the − symbol for the properties in the second row. We generate the table 20.2. Now,
we denote the following:
1. The number of objects with parameter a but not parameter b as N(a, −b) (c can
be anything) and is simply N3 + N4.
2. The number of objects with parameter b but not a parameter c as N(b, −c), which
is N2 + N6.
3. The number of objects with the parameter a but not parameter c as N(a, −c)
and is N2 + N4.
For any collection of objects with the three different parameters a, b and c the result is the
following:

The number of objects with a and not b plus the number of objects with b and not c is greater
than or equal to the number of objects with a and not c.
This is written as
N(a, −b) + N(b, −c) ≥ N(a, −c). (20.14)
In terms of probability the above equation is written as
P(a, −b) + P(b, −c) ≥ P(a, −c). (20.15)
The above relation is called Bell’s inequality or Bell’s theorem4 which is true for any hidden
variables theory that satisfies the notions of reality and locality. This is one version of Bell’s
inequalities. Let us prove the relation (20.15).
Consider N(a, −b, c) + N(−a, b, −c). This must be ≥ 0 because either some members of
the group have these combination or no members do. So,
N(a, −b, c) + N(−a, b, −c) ≥ 0 . (20.16)
Suppose we add N(a, −b, −c) and N(a, b, −c) to (20.16):
N(a, −b, c) + N(−a, b, −c) + N(a, −b, −c) + N(a, b, −c)
> 0 + N(a, −b, −c) + N(a, b, −c). (20.17)
We note that
N(a, −b, −c) + N(a, b, −c) = N(a, −c), (20.18a)
N(a, −b, c) + N(a, −b, −c) = N(a, −b), (20.18b)
N(−a, b, −c) + N(a, b, −c) = N(b, −c). (20.18c)
Using (20.18) in (20.17) we observe
N(a, −b) + N(b, −c) ≥ N(a, −c). (20.19)
This inequality is obtained without using quantum mechanics but with the principles of
locality and reality. For presentations of Bell’s theorem without inequalities see refs. [24,25].
It has been shown that the prediction of quantum mechanics violates this inequality. We
present another version of Bell’s inequality which we use in the next section for a quantum
prediction.
Suppose we consider an experiment in which object 1 is picked randomly and a second
object 2 is picked with each property opposite of object 1. P(a, −b) for object 1 is equal to
the probability that object 1 has property a and the object 2 has the property b (that is,
opposite to −b). We designate it as P(1a, 2b). Then Eq. (20.19) becomes
P(1a, 2b) + P(1b, 2c) ≥ P(1a, 2c). (20.20)
20.7 Violation of Bell’s Theorem
Let us examine the Bell’s theorem, the inequality given by Eq. (20.20), in quantum me￾chanics [3].

It becomes maximum (P+− = 1/2) when θ1 = θ2.
We use the result in the above solved problem to verify the Bell’s theorem. To test the
Bell’s inequality, first write its quantum version. Assume that pair of the atom emitted by
a source have a total spin 0 and they travel in opposite directions. If the right-side atom is
spin-up then its companion atom is spin-down provided the Stern–Gerlach filters have the
same orientation. We set a, b and c as in table 20.3 and assume the following:
1. The polarizers measure the spins at locations separated by a space interval. Then
the polarizers cannot influence each other. That is, we assume that no influence
propagates faster than the speed of light. Otherwise, the measurement by one
polarizer introduce uncontrollable phase factors into the wave function. This is a
kind of uncertainty principle.
2. The objects have properties (such as spin) even if they are not measured.
Suppose the Stern–Gerlach filters allow only spin-up atoms to pass through. We consider
the application of Eq. (20.20) to spin measurements. Remember that Eq. (20.20) is for the
case of each with properties opposite to the other. In a spin measurement also we consider
the same. This is realized if the two polarizers have the same orientation implying that
the atoms have opposite spins. We determine whether the right-side atom is spin-up, 0o
,
not spin-up 45o by measuring its spin at 0o and its companion’s spin at 45o
. The Bell’s
inequality, Eq. (20.20), becomes
P(1up 0o
, 2up 45o
) + P(1up 45o
, 2up 90o
) ≥ P(1up 0o
, 2up 90o
). (20.26)
Evaluate each term in Eq. (20.26) using Eq. (20.24). We have

That is, 0.0732 + 0.0732 = 0.1464 ≥ 0.25 which is false. The local hidden variables model
with the particles having a definite spin orientation before they are detected is wrong.
Thus, the prediction of quantum mechanics violates the Bell’s inequality. The existence of
local hidden variables is inconsistent with the predictions of quantum theory. Thus, Bell
discovered that assumption of local realism is not in accordance with quantum physics.

if the angles are 0o

20.7.2 Experimental Tests of Bell’s Theorem
What is the outcome of real experiments? The result is that the inequality is violated. The
predictions of quantum mechanics and Bell’s theorem were tested experimentally for photons
and protons. These experiments helped us to understand the basics of quantum mechanics.
Moreover, gave birth to fascinating new topics such as quantum information, quantum
teleportation, quantum computation and quantum cryptography. The first experiment was
carried out by Clauser and Freedman at Berkely [25]. The most famous experiment was
performed by Aspect, Dalibard and Roger in Paris [26]. These experiments are quite difficult.
The most striking point is that all the experiments agreed with the quantum mechanical
results and Bell’s inequality was violated.
Most of the experiments were based on correlations between the polarizations of pairs
of photons. Correlated photons can be produced in many ways. An example is anni￾hilation of positronium into two photons. Here initial and final angular momenta are
zero. Alternatively, an atom in an excited state with angular momentum zero decays by
J = 0 → J = 1 → J = 0 cascade emitting two photons.
In a typical experiment a source emits polarization-conserved pairs of photons. Each
photon is passed through a polarizer. Behind each polarizer, the transmitted photons are
registered. Conservation of polarization implies that if the photon-1 is measured and found
in horizontal (H) polarization then photon-2 will be vertical (V ) and vice-versa. Before
measurement the total wave function is
|ψi =
1
√
2
(|Hi1|V i2 − |V i1|Hi2) . (20.31)474 Mysteries in Quantum Mechanics
A version of Bell’s inequality is
|E(a, b) − E(−a, b)| + |E(a, −b) + E(−a, −b)| ≤ 2 , (20.32)
where
E(a, b) = 1
N
[C++(a, b) + C−−(a, b) − C+−(a, b) − C−+(a, b)] . (20.33)
Here + and − are the outputs of a two-channel polarizer. Then C++(a, b) is the number of
coincidences between the + output port of the polarizer measuring photon-1 along a and +
output port of the polarizer measuring photon-2 along b. For a = 0, b = 22.5
o Eq. (20.32)
is found to be 2√
2 < 2 a clear violation of Bell’s inequality.
One may wonder about the contradiction between Bell’s theorem and quantum me￾chanics. A possible reason is the difference between ideal experiment and measurement.
But in real experiments we can consider reasonable assumptions about the working of the
apparatus, noise, etc. Moreover, in the Bell’s theorem the polarizers are assumed to act
independently. If this is incorrect then signal (passing faster than light) connecting the two
polarizers is possible. Next, the experiments have always involved fixing the angles of po￾larizers and then taking data. Thus, one may argue that the polarizers have much time to
know orientation of each other.
Greenberger et al. [27] have demonstrated Bell’s theorem in a new way by analyzing a
system consisting of 3 or more correlated spin-1/2 particles. Here again Bell’s theorem is
violated by quantum mechanical predictions. In 1993, Hardy proposed a situation where
nonlocality can be inferred without using inequalities [28].
20.8 Resolving EPR Paradox
The EPR’s nonlocality puzzle can be resolved [29] if the correct physical input is used for
the calculation of the quantum correlations.
Suppose the result of spin measurement is two-valued. Let A and B denote the outcomes
±1. a and b denote the settings of the apparatus for the first particle and the second particle,
respectively. The statement of locality is A(a) = ±1 , B(b) = ±1. The existence of reality
is that some hidden variables decide the outcomes even before the measurement. This is
stated as A(a, h1) = ±1 , B(b, h2) = ±1, where h1 and h2 are hidden variables associated
with the outcomes. The experimenter can compute a correlation function of the outcomes
defined by P(a, b) = 1
N
P(AiBi). This is the classical function obtained by averaging the
products of the form (++ = +), (−− = +), (+− = −) and (−+ = −). The joint events
(++) and (−−) are coincidences and the events (+−) and (−+) are anticoincidences. P(a, b)
denotes the average of the quantity (number of anticoincidences). The Bell correlation is
then R
dhP(h)A(a, h1)B(b, h2), where R
dhP(h) = 1.
Assume that a measurement on one particle does not alter either the magnitude or phase
of the complex amplitude of the other particle. In particular, measurement on one particle
does not make the other particle to possess a definite state. At each location a measurement
yield two-valued denoted by + and − for each particle. The local amplitudes for the events
+ and − for the two particles are denoted by the complex functions C1+, C1−, C2+ and
C2−. Amplitudes C1+ and C2− are mutually orthogonal. Then the statement of locality is
C1± = C1±(a, φ1) and C2± = C2±(b, φ2), where φ1 and φ2 are the hidden variables.
The correlation function is now of the form U(a, b) = R.P.(NCiC

normalization factor. Let as C1+ = (1/

((θ1 − θ2)/2) − 1 = − cos(θ1 − θ2). This is identical to the quantum
mechanical prediction obtained from the singlet entangled state and the Pauli spin operator.
20.9 Concluding Remarks
Quantum theory does not give exact outcome of a measurement but it gives various possi￾ble outcomes. Even if the event has occurred the outcome is known (according to quantum
theory) only a measurement or observation is made. With out observation, the value of
a dynamical variable cannot be given any meaning in quantum mechanics. All quantum
systems are supposed to exist in some sort of state of probabilistic uncertainty until an ob￾servation or measurement is made and the wave function collapses. A measurement process
not only makes the wave function collapse into one of the possibilities but in some exper￾iments it is responsible for the wave or particle character of the system. For example, the
wave behaviour of light in double-slit experiment and particle-like character in photoelectric
experiment are not a property of light but are the property of our interaction with light
through measuring process. Schr¨odinger equation does not tell us which event is going to
happen at various times and at various places and how an event will occur at a place at a
given time. Its goal is not to predict the actual events going to take place at various times
and places but to predict the possible events.
An important point is that given the value of ψ at t = t0 and assuming fixed boundary
conditions the Schr¨odinger equation determines the value of ψ at t > t0. In this sense and
because there is no stochastic term in the equation the quantum description of state of a
system is deterministic. If the events occur purely by chance then how we are able to find the
probabilities of the events. This is because probabilities are given by probability function,
and probability function is obtained from wave function. Wave function is the solution of
the Schr¨odinger equation − which is completely deterministic.

Delayed-Choice Experiments
21.1 Introduction
In the 17th century, there existed two theories of light, namely, the wave theory of Huy￾gens and the corpuscular theory of Newton. At the beginning of 19th century Thomas
Young demonstrated the wave character of light using diffraction experiments. James Clerk
Maxwell developed his electromagnetic wave equation and showed that light is an electro￾magnetic wave. The wave nature of light could not explain photoelectric effect. Einstein
explained the photoelectric effect using the hypothesis that light is a quantum of energy,
which is produced or absorbed as a whole like a particle.
In 1924 de Broglie postulated that all particles with mass behave as a wave also with the
associated wavelength λ = h/p. The wave characteristic of electron was confirmed through
diffraction experiment with a nickel crystal by Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer in 1927.
Claus J¨onsson in 1961 performed the first double slit diffraction experiment with electron.
Quantum mechanics differs from classical mechanics as it incorporates with itself strange
and weird concepts like wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, nonexistence of
trajectories and collapse of the wave function due to measurement of observables. The double
slit experiments performed with particle and particle detectors demonstrate nonclassical
behaviour of microscopic particles. The interference observed in double slit experiments
with microscopic particles demonstrate their wave character and detectors of the particles
detect them as particles.
Essentially, the arrangement of the double slit experiment appears to induce particle
or wave charcter of light. To make things very clear we can consider a Mach–Zehnder in￾terferometer experiment an equivalent experiment of the double slit experiment. To test
whether light priorily get the information about the experimental set up in the double slit
experiment John Archibald Wheeler proposed a gedanken delayed-choice experiment with
the Mach–Zehnder interferometer. This thought experiment was then realized experimen￾tally using various systems. An experiment was proposed to observe simultaneously both
particle and wave character of the quantum through quantum entanglement. We discuss
these developments in the present chapter.
21.2 Single Slit and Double Slit Experiments
We consider the slit experiments with a beam of particles and with one particle at a time

21.2.1 Experiments With Particle
The experimental set up for the double slit experiment with particle is shown schematically
in Fig. 21.1. Let a, d and L are width of a single slit, the distance separation of the two
slits and the distance separation of the slits and the screen, respectively. A parallel beam
of microscopic particles with constant velocity v is made to fall on a double slit.
Suppose we first close the lower slit allowing the particles to pass only through the upper
slit. Then we will get the single slit diffraction pattern at the screen. Classical diffraction
theory gives the intensity of the single slit diffraction pattern as [1,2]

where φ is as defined in Fig. 21.1. The intensity of the single slit diffraction pattern is shown
in Fig. 21.2. If the upper slit is closed allowing the particles to pass only through the lower
slit we will again get the same diffraction pattern displaced downwards by the slit separation
d. Classical theory explains successfully the diffraction pattern of a single slit.Single Slit and Double Slit Experiments 481

Suppose we now keep both the slits open then particles can pass through both slits. In
this case the intensity of the double slit diffraction pattern is given by [1,3]

. (21.2)
Then we will observe a fringe pattern on the screen as shown in Fig. 21.3. We get the same
diffraction pattern for the particles as that of a coherent monochromatic beam of light. The
double slit experiment establishes the wave nature of microscopic particles. The maxima and
minima of the diffraction, respectively, arise only due to the constructive and destructive
interactions of the waves of the particles passing through the upper and lower slits.
21.2.2 Experiment With One Particle At a Time
When a beam of particles is incident on the slits we may think that the interference pattern
is observed due to the interferences of waves of some particles going through the upper slit
with some other particles passing through the lower slit. In order to test this assumption
experiments were done by passing one particle at a time through the double slit apparatus.
If the assumption that the interference pattern arises due to the interference arises due to
the interference of waves of the particles passing through both the slits then for this case no
interference should be observed as a single particle can pass through only in one of the two
slits. But it has been experimentally observed by many workers that even if one particle is
passed at a time through the double slit apparatus the double slit interference pattern is
observed. Though a single particle cannot pass through both the slits at the same time the
wave associated with the particle passes through both the slits at the same time thereby
producing interference pattern.
We can think of a modification of this experiment in which we try to find the slit through
which the particle will pass by keeping detectors at each slit. Then it will be found that
each particle passes through one slit or other and never on both slits. Both detectors will
not detect the particle simultaneously. If the detectors are of the type which allow the
particle to pass through the slits while recording its passage, will we get the same double
slit interference pattern? We will not get the interference pattern. We will get just the
superposition of two single slit diffraction patterns only. That is, the detection of the path
of the particle through the slits has destroyed the interference pattern.482 Delayed-Choice Experiments
The modified experiments have been done with photons and atoms. These experiments
were done using entangled particles (refer sec. 20.3.1 for some details about entanglement).
The which-way information of one particle passing through the slits can be obtained from
the measurements done on the other entangled particle. Through this experiment we can
conclude that measurement of the path of the particle destroys the interference pattern and
the particle shows only its particle characteristics. If no detector detects the path of the
particle at the slits an interference pattern is observed and the particle shows only its wave
characteristics. The point is that the type of experiments we perform determines either
the particle nature or wave nature. No experiment can determine both wave and particle
characteristics of a particle simultaneously. As Bohr postulated the wave and particle nature
are complementary to each other .
21.3 Quantum Mechanical Explanation
We have found from the previous experiment that turning on the slit detectors forced the
particle to move in one of the slits whereas turning off the detectors forced the particle
to interact with both the slits and produced the interference pattern. As discussed earlier
the type of experimental set up decides whether the particle behaves as a particle or a
wave. How does quantum mechanics explain this experiment? This wave-particle duality
experiment is explained by the superposition principle of quantum states.
First, we consider the case when the slit detectors are absent and both slits are kept open.
ψ1(z) and ψ2(z) are the states localized at the location of slit-1 (upper slit) and slit-2 (lower
slit), respectively. Then the particle will emerge from the double slit in a superposition state
|ψi =
1
√
2
(|ψ1i + |ψ2i). (21.3)
|ψ1i and |ψ2i are orthogonal because of their spatial separation. The probability of finding
the particle at position z in the screen is given by
|hz|ψi|2 =

|ψ1(z, t)|

∗
1
(z, t)ψ2(z, t) + ψ
∗
2
(z, t)ψ1(z, t)

. (21.4)
The last two terms give the interference.
Next, we consider the case where the slit-detectors are present to detect the path of the
particles passing through the slits. Let us assume that the which-way detector is a 1-bit
detector, |↑i state for particle passing through slit-1 and | ↓i state for the particle passing
through slit-2. What will be the state of the particle coming out of the slits? The which-way
detector states get entangled with the states of the two paths and the combined state of
the particle and which-way detector is given by
|ψi =
1
√
2
[|ψ1i|↑i + |ψ2i| ↓i] . (21.5)
|↑i and | ↓i are orthogonal states as both particle detectors at the two slits cannot detect
the particle at the same time. Now, we get the probability density of the particle falling on
the screen at position z as

. (21.6)Experiment With Mach–Zehnder Interferometer 483
Equation (21.6) does not have the interference term as in Eq. (21.4). Equation (21.6) cor￾responds to the classical superpostion of two single slit diffraction pattern. The which-way
detection experiment detects the particle nature of the quantum particle.

Show that the interference terms vanishes for the wave function given by Eq. (21.5).

21.4 Experiment With Mach–Zehnder Interferometer
We can consider an equivalent double slit experiment with Mach–Zehnder interferometer.
The schematic of a Mach–Zehnder interferometer is shown in Fig. 21.4. A quantum particle
like photon, electron, neutron enters from left into the interferometer through a semitrans￾parent (50 : 50) beam splitter. We denote the state of the transmitter part in arm b as |0i
and the reflected part as |1i. Let a phase φ be introduced in the reflected arm a. Then the
quantum state of the system is a superposition of the two paths

FIGURE 21.4
Schematic of a Mach–Zehnder interferomete484 Delayed-Choice Experiments
If the beam splitter BS2 is not present then detector D0 will register the quantum particle
travelled in arm b and detector D1 will register the quantum particle travelled in arm b
and detector D1 will register the quantum particle travelled in arm a. When BS2 is not
present we get the which-way information of the particle. From Eq. (21.10) the probability
of detection of the outcome |0i and |1i are Pa = Pb = 1/2. Both the detectors will not
respond at the same time if a single particle is allowed inside the interferometer. Without
BS2 we find that the quantum particle behaves as a particle.
Now, suppose BS2 is present. Then the beam will be splitted with one transmitted and
another reflected for both a and b quantum particle beam. The transmitted and reflected
states of BS2 can be represented by the states √
1
2
(|0i ± |1i). Then the detection probability
of a′ at D1 detector will be Pa′ = cos2
(φ/2) and the detection probability of b′ at D0
will be Pb′ = sin2
(φ/2). We note that the detection probabilities in detectors D0 and D1
are dependent on the phase difference φ between the quantum particle travelled in a and
b arms. That is, the quantum particle behaves as a wave producing interference pattern
on the detectors depending on the phase difference φ. In short, we find that the quantum
particle behaves as a particle if BS2 is not present and behaves as waves if BS2 is present.
Presence and absence of BS2 are two different experiments. Hence, the wave nature and
particle nature are revealed by these two different experiments.
21.5 Delayed-Choice Experiment
The two experiments considered in the previous section are mutually exclusive as BS2
cannot be simultaneously inserted or removed. If we have set up any one of the experiment
well in advance before the photon enters the interferometer then one could reconcile Bohr’s
complementary principle with Einstein’s local conception of reality. We may then think that
the photon could have received some hidden information about the chosen experimental set
up and it would have travelled either as a particle or a wave according to the experimental
set up. Then a hidden variable theory can explain the results of the two experiments.
The next obvious question to be explored is how does a single photon show its wave or
particle character when the introduction of BS2 or its removal is delayed until the photon
emerges out of BS1. In an interferometer experiment the choice to observe the particle or
wave character of a quantum particle can be delayed with respect to the quantum particle
entering the interferometer. It is also possible to observe a continuous transformation be￾tween these two experimental arrangements before the measurements are done. The history
of delayed-choice gedanken experiment can be traced back to 1927 when Heisenberg put
forwarded his uncertainty princple using a γ-ray microscope. For a brief history of delayed￾choice experiments one may refer to the ref. [4]. The interest on delayed-choice experiment
was revived by the thought experiment proposed in the refs. [5,6].
John Archibald Wheeler proposed a delayed-choice experiment with the Mach-Zehnder
interferometer in which the choice of which property of the quantum particle will be observed
is made after the photon has passed the first beam splitter BS1. The removal or insertion
of BS2 is done after the photon has passed through BS1. In this delayed-choice experiment
one can decide whether the photon has come by one route (as a particle) or both routes (as
a wave) after it has already done its travel.
The complete sheme proposed by Wheeler with single photon was experimentally re￾alized in 2007 [7]. This experiment unambiguously proved Wheeler’s supposition that a
delayed-choice of experiment affect the past history of the photon. Wheeler’s delayed-choiceDelayed-Choice Experiment 485
FIGURE 21.5
Schematic of the quantum delayed-choice experiment. For details see the text.
experiment with a single atom was then realized in 2015 [8]. The delayed-choice experiment
rules out the assumption that the photon could have known in advance what type of ex￾perimental apparatus that it will be confronted with and then decides to behave either as
a wave or a particle. Therefore, a hidden variable theory which assumes that the photon
knows in advance the type of experimental set up it will face, cannot explain the results of
delayed-choice experiment.
A quantum version of Wheeler’s delayed-choice experiment based on a quantum￾controlled beam splitter has been proposed [9]. This quantum-controlled beam splitter can
also be in a superposition state of being present and absent. The schematic of the quantum
delayed-choice experiment is shown in Fig. 21.5.
In the quantum delayed experiment, the first beam splitter BS1 is represented by the
Hadamard quantum gate which has the transformation H = 1
√
2

1 1
1 −1

. If the two
photon states of the a and b arms in the standard Mach-Zehnder interferometer are rep￾resented by |1i and |0i, respectively, then the first H transforms the photon state |0i into
the superposition state 1
√
2
(|0i + |1i). A phase shifter then introduces a relative phase φ
between the two states giving the superposition state 1
√
2
(|0i + eiφ
|1i). This state is the
input state for the second Hadamard gate which is controlled by an ancilla photon.
If the ancilla photon is prepared in state |0i then no beam splitter will be present. With
|0i control bit, the second Hadamard operation will be just an identity operation. Hence,
the output state will be the input state
|ψPi =
1
√
2
￾
|0i + eiφ
|1i

. (21.11)
The measurement indicates that the probability detections in the |0i (b-arm) and |1i (a arm)
basis give Pa = Pb = 1/2. The final measurement indicates the path the photon took. Hence,
the ancillary photon state |0i is equivalent to the absence of BS2 in the conventional Mach–
Zehnder interferometer. We detect the particle nature of the photon for this experimental
condition. If the ancilla photon is prepared in the state |1i then it is equivalent to the
presence of BS2. Applying the Hadamard operation to |ψi will give the output state
|ψwi = cos(φ/2)|0i − i sin(φ/2)|1i (21.12)
leaving out a common phase factor. Equation (21.12) gives the probability of detection
Pa′ = sin2
(φ/2) and Pb′ = cos2
(φ/2). The final measurement gives information about
the phase φ that was introduced between the two states. We get the interference patter486 Delayed-Choice Experiments
corresponding to the wave nature of the photon for the experiment done using the ancilla
photon prepared in state |1i.
Conventional beam splitter BS2 can only be present or absent. But a quantum controlled
beam splitter can be put in a superposition of being present and absent. We get |ψpi as
output for the ancilla state |0ia and |ψwi for the ancilla state |1ia. Thus, for the ancilla
state cos α|0ia + sin α|1ia we get the output
|ψf(α, φ)i = cos α|ψPia + sinα|ψwia. (21.13)
We find that the quantum state and the ancilla photons have now become entangled for
0 < α < π/2. The photon detector D0 now measures the intensity proabability
Ib = I0(φ, α) = IP(φ) cos2 α + Iw(φ) sin2 α (21.14)
and the detector D1 measures the intensity probability
Ia = I1 = 1 − I0. (21.15)
The contrast of an interference pattern is quantified by the term interferometric visibility
also called fringe visibility or simply visibility and is given by
V =
I0max − I0min
I0max + I0min
, (21.16)
where I0 is given by Eq. (21.14). I0max and I0min are to be computed by varying φ.
From Eqs. (21.11) and (21.12) we find Ip(φ) = 1/2 and Iw(φ) = cos2
(φ/2). So,
I0(φ, α) = 1
2
cos2 α + cos2
(φ/2) sin2 α. (21.17)
For this I0 the visibility is V = sin2 α. We observe that by changing α we can alter contin￾uously the interference pattern from a particle at α = 0 and to a wave at α = π/2.
A quantum beam splitter makes it possible to prepare a photon in a superposition of
particles and wave. Such a superposition does not have a classical analog. The presently
available hidden variable theories in which particle and wave are realistic properties can￾not explain the delayed-choice experiments. Based on quantum-controlled beam splitter
experimentally the particle and wave behaviours of photon to be present simultaneously
was investigated [10]. Further, this quantum nature of the photon was tested using a Bell
inequality. It was found that no model in which the photon knew in advance whether it
would behave as particle or wave could account for the observed experimental data.
For more discussion on delayed-choice experiments one may refer to the refs. [11–19].
21.6 Delayed-Choice Quantum Eraser
In a delayed-choice quantum eraser interference fringes are obtained by erasing which-way
information after the interfering quantum particle has already been detected [20]. In a
quantum eraser the which-way information of the signal photon is encoded in an entangled
ancillary photon. One can then perform certain measurement on the ancilla which can make
the which-way information unobtainable. The measurement done on the ancillary entangled
photon erases the which-way information of the signal photon. This measurement can also
be done after the measurement done on the signal photon in the interferometer. WhenDelayed-Choice Quantum Eraser 487
the result of signal measurement done earlier is correlated with the results of the eraser
measurement done later we can reconstruct the interference pattern. The temporal order
of the measurements on different systems is irrelevant even if the systems are entangled.
The measurement on ancilla is performed long after the signal photon has passed through
the interferometer. This protocal is known as delayed-choice quantum eraser . We give the
theory of delayed-choice quantum eraser described in [21].
Consider a photon described by the superposition state |ψi = √
1
2
(|Hi + |Vi), where
|Hi denotes horizontal polarization state and |Vi the vertical polarization state. We let the
photon pass through a polarization interferometer. On passing through this interferometer
let there be a relative phase φ be introduced between the |Hi and |Vi states. The photon
state after the phase change will be
|ψ
′
i =
1
√
2
￾
|Hi + eiφ
|Vi

. (21.18)
A measurement on the H − V basis will give the probability of 1/2 for both horizontal and
vertical polarizations. The measurement probability 1/2 for both |Hi and |Vi states shows
that the photon does not show any interference as the paths of the vertical polarized photon
and horizontally polarized photon is known. The measurement in H − V basis will detect
the photon as a particle.
Now, if we measure in the ±45◦
(diagonal) basis with the corresponding eigenstates
| ± 45◦
i = √
1
2
(|Hi ± |Vi) the probability will be
P(+45◦
) = |h+45◦
|ψ
′
i|2 = cos2 φ, (21.19)
pP(−45◦
) = |h−45◦
|ψ
′
i|2 = sin2 φ. (21.20)
The oscillating probabilities of the detector signals give the interference pattern. Hence, the
measurement on the ±45◦ basis give the wave nature of the photon.
Next, let us consider two photons in the entangled state
|ψi =
1
√
2
(|Hi|Hi + |Vi|Vi). (21.21)
Let one of the photons (called signal) pass through the interferometer leading to the com￾posite state
|ψ
′
i =
1
√
2
￾
|Hi|Hi + eiφ
|Vi|Vi

. (21.22)
Suppose we measure the signal in the ±45◦ basis and the other photon (called idler ) in
the H − V basis then we get the joint probability for the ±45◦ polarization measurement of
signal and H and V polarization measurements for the idler photon as
P(45◦
, H) = 1
4
, P(45◦
, V) = 1
4
. (21.23)
The joint probability of these two independent measurements give results which are inde￾pendent of φ. These two independent measurements give the particle nature of the signal.
This result is obtained as the idler measurement has given the which-way information of
the signal.
Suppose we measure both the signal and idler polarization in ±45◦ basis then the joint
probability of finding +45◦ polarization of the signal and idler photon is given by
P(45◦
, 45◦
) = 1
2
cos2
(φ/2). (21.2488 Delayed-Choice Experiments
Finding +45◦ polarization for signal and −45◦ polarization for idler photon giving the joint
probability. Similarly,
P(45◦
, −45◦
) = 1
2
sin2
(φ/2). (21.25)
We find that the signal photon behaves like a wave after correlating these two independent
measurements. Also, the sum of these two probabilities is always 1/2 and independent of
φ. Hence, it is found that unless the eraser measurement is actually carried out on the
idler photon and the result is correlated with the signal measurement result no interference
pattern can be observed. The probabilities given by Eqs. (21.24) and (21.25) do not depend
on whether we first measure the idler or the signal. The relative time order of these two
independent measurements is immaterial. But the choice between interference and path
information is only open until both measurements have been carried out. Quantum eraser
experiments have been realized by various groups [4,22–33].
21.7 Concluding Remarks
Quantum mechanics incorporates strange and weird concepts like wave-particle duality,
nonexistence of trajectories, uncertainty principle and collapse of the wave function. The
quantum particles (usually microscopic particles) behave strangely. For example, they be￾have as particles in certain experiments and as waves in some other experiments. Davisson
and Germer demonstrated the wave nature of electron using crystal diffraction in 1927. In
1963 Richard Feynman described an interference experiment of particles using a double slit.
The experiment as described by Feynman was performed in 1973 [34]. Later the double slit
interference pattern was also observed even if one particle at a time passed through the
double slit apparatus. Experiment with double slit has has also proved that any experiment
in which the path of the particle is measured will not show any interference pattern. A slit
detector can find whether a particle passed through it or not.
Wheeler raised a question whether we can observe the interference pattern by detecting
the path of the particle through the slit after the particle has passed through the slit.
The question is whether the particle decides to behave as a particle or wave at the slits
itself irrespective of its path determined later. Wheeler’s thought experiment has been
tested using Mach–Zehnder interferometer using a second beam splitter. The absence of
the second beam splitter will reveal the particle nature and the presence of it will show
interference pattern corresponding to wave nature of the particle. The removal and inclusion
of the second beam splitter can be delayed even after the particle has passed through the
first beam splitter. This experiment established that particle behaves as wave or particle
depending on the final detection arrangements only.
The above mentioned experiments were done using a quantum beam splitter using
Hadamard quantum gate with the control of an ancilla photon. This ancilla photon can
be in a superposition state of present and absent and it is possible to prepare a photon
state in a superposition of particle and wave. It is also possible to create a pair of entangled
photons, a signal photon and an ancillary photon. The ancillary photon carries which-way
information of the signal photon. It is possible to erase this information on the ancillary
photon after the signal photon has been detected. Such an erasure of the which-way infor￾mation correlated with the signal information will give interference pattern. The time order
of the measurement of signal photon and ancillary photon is of no consequence.Bibliography 489
Various delayed-choice experiments serve as striking illustrations of the inherently non￾classical feature of quantum mechanics. They play an important role in the foundations of
quantum mechanics. These experiments clearly demonstrate that a quantum particle does
not decide to behave either as a wave or as a particle by adapting a priori on the experimen￾tal situation. This is confirmed by experiments with space-like separation of the changing
the beam splitter BS2 from the entry of the photon at BS1 as no signal can travel with
velocity greater than the velocity of light.
We find from the delayed-choice experiments that quantum effects mimic an influence of
future actions on past events. The delayed-choice experiments reveal a type of retrocasuality.
Actually, it is one of the weird nature of quantum mechanics which presents a kind of
causal connection, which is generically different from anything that could be characterized
classically since the causal connection cannot be clearly analyzed into a cause and effect
[35] .
In quantum mechanics the relative temporal order of measurement of events is not rele￾vant. No physical interactions or signals are necessary to explain the experimental results.
In explaining an individual observation of one system one has to include the whole ex￾perimental configuration and also the complete quantum state, potentially describing joint
properties with other systems as seen in quantum eraser experiments. The results of the
delayed-choice experiments cannot be explained by any hidden variable theory as these
experiments highlight certain nonclassical features.

Fractional Quantum Mechanics
22.1 Introduction
A great deal of interest has been paid over the decades to extend the standard quantum
mechanics. One extension is the analysis of systems with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. An￾other development is the fractional quantum mechanics (FQM) introduced by Nick Laskin
in 2000 [1–3]. It is well known that the appearance of the Schr¨odinger equation of a free
particle is like the ordinary diffusion equation
∂p
∂t =
σ
2
∂
2p
∂x2
, (22.1)
where p represents the concentration of the diffusion material and σ is the diffusion coeffi￾cient. Equation (22.1) is based on the Gaussian distribution for random walk problems. This
implies that we can derive the standard Schr¨odinger equation by considering the Gaussian
probability distribution in the space for all possible paths. Richard Phillips Feynman and
Albert Roach Hibbs derived the standard Schr¨odinger equation making use of path integrals
over Brownian paths [4]. That is, the consideration of Brownian motion of paths led to the
Schr¨odinger equation.
Use of non-Gaussian distributions gives rise fractional diffusion equation and the corre￾sponding diffusion is known as anomalous diffusion. Consider the diffusion equation of the
form
∂
βp
∂tβ
= c
∂
αp
∂xα
. (22.2)
We have the following three cases [5]:
1. Space fractional diffusion equation: β = 1, 0 < α < 2.
2. Time fractional diffusion equation: 0 < β < 1, α = 2.
3. Space-time fractional diffusion equation: β 6= 1, α 6= 2.
In this direction we can consider different types of Schr¨odinger equation.
Laskin in 2000 applying the path integral approach of Feynman by considering L´evy
distribution instead of Gaussian distribution for the possible paths for quantum mechanical
systems shown that the associated equation of motion is

where ψ = ψ(x, t) (we assume one-dimensional case), V = V (x, t), α is the L´evy index (1 <
α ≤ 2), Dα is a constant and the Laplacian operator is fractional. Equation (22.3) is called
space fractional Schro¨dinger equation (space FSE). The probability density pL(x, t; , x0, t0)
of the L´evy α-stable distribution is given by
pL(x, t; x0, t0) = 1

where α is the L´evy index and σα is the generalized diffusion coefficient. α defines the
index of the distribution and controls the scale properties of the stochastic process {x} and
σα selects the scale unit of the process [2,5,6]. α is also called stability index and it takes
values between 0 and 2. When α = 2 the L´evy distribution becomes the familiar Gaussian
distribution. Thus, Eq. (22.3) with α = 2 corresponds to the standard Schr¨odinger equation.
Instead of first-order time derivative term in the Schr¨odinger equation Mark Naber
considered Caputo fractional derivative thereby proposed time FSE [5]. In the time FSE,
the time derivative is non-integer order while the space derivative is second-order. The
associated Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian and more over nonlocal in time. Space-time FSE
was introduced by Shaowei Wang and Mingyu Xu [7].
The behaviour of particles with fractional spin is described by FSE and thus deals with
fractional effect in quantum mechanics. Applications of FQM in a condensed matter physics
based on L´evy crystals [8], transverse light dynamics in aspherical optical resonators [9],
splitting and diffraction of Gaussian beam in the case 1 < α < 2 for potential free case [10],
beam propagation management [11,12], gravitational optics [13] and conical diffraction of
input beams [14] have been explored.
Various features of FQM, particularly, properties, determination of solutions, represen￾tation in momentum space, physical realization or applications and extension to relativity
have been investigated. We present these developments in the present chapter.
22.2 Integer and Fractional Diffusion Equations
The solution of the diffusion Eq. (22.1) is
p =
1
p
2πσ(t − t0)
e
−(x−x0)
2
/(2σ(t−t0)) (22.5)
and
(x − x0)
2 ∝ σ(t − t0). (22.6)
The diffusion path is described by the Gaussian function in Eq. (22.5). With δx = x − x0,
δt = t − t0 and T = N δt the length of the diffusion path is
L = N δx =
T δx
δt = σT (δx)
−1
. (22.7)
The dimension df of a path length is defined through
L ∝ (δx)
1−df
. (22.8)
Comparing the Eqs. (22.7) and (22.8) we find that for the diffusion path considered the
dimension df = 2, an integer. The dimensions of a point and a line segment are 0 and
1, respectively. They have integer dimension. There are mathematical and real objects
with fractional dimensions also called fractal dimension. Examples of objects with fractal
dimension include Cantor set, Mandelbrot set, chaotic attractors, lightning and electricity,
snowflakes and clouds.
We can realize fractional diffusion equation and FQM by considering L´evy random
process with the probability density given by Eq. (22.4). What is the dimension associated
with the L´evy path? From Eq. (22.4) we have
(x − x0) ∝ (σα(t − t0))1/α

22.3 Wave Function and Kernel
Consider the Schr¨odinger equation i~∂ψ/∂t = Hψ in one-dimension. We can define a time
evolution operator U(t) that transforms ψ(0) to ψ(t) as ψ(t) = U(t)ψ(0). For the case of H
independent of time we write U(t) = e−iHt/~
. Let the path of a particle starts from xi at
an initial time ti and reaches xf at tf . The probability amplitude A for a particle to be at
xf at tf is given by
A = K(xf , tf ; xi
, ti) = hxf | exp(−iHδt/~)|xii. (22.14)
K is called the propagator from xi to xf and is also called Feynman’s kernel or simply
kernel. Further,
ψ(x, t) = Z
dxiK(xf , tf ; xi
, ti)ψ(xi
, ti). (22.15)
K contains the details about the evolution of ψ.
We can obtain an expression for the kernel K in the form of a summation (or integral)
over all paths in the phase space from time ti to the time tf , that is, from xi to xf . This is
known as path integral representation of kernel [4,15–18]. We divide the time interval tf −ti
into N (large) steps with the step size δt = t/N. Then
K(xf , tf ; xi

We write
ψf (Xf , tf ) = Z
dXiKL (Xf , tf ; Xi

We wish to find the evolution equation for the wave function. For an infinitesimal increment
in time, say, from t to t + ǫ, Eq. (22.32) becomes
ψ(X, t + ǫ) = Z
dX′KL (X, t + ǫ; X′

We use Eq. (22.26) for KL(X, t + ǫ; X′

generating the probability. Iα < 0 corresponds to the presence of a sink at X at time t

22.6 Fractional Schrodinger Equation in Relativistic Quantum ¨

From the relativistic energy-momentum relation we write the kinetic energy TR as
TR =
p
p2c
2 + m2c
4 . (22.75)
For v ≪ c and α = 2
TR ≈ mc2 +
1
2m
p
2 = mc2 + T2. (22.76)
In the case of extremely high speed (α = 1), we can neglect the rest energy and write
TR ≈ mc2 = |p|c = T1. (22.7504 Fractional Quantum Mechanics
The point is that the variation of the speed of a particle from low value to high value
approximately equivalent to the variation of α from 2 to 1. That is, we can regard the
relativistic kinetic energy as an approximate realization of the fractional kinetic energy.

22.7.4 Schrodinger Picture ¨
In chapter 7 we discussed three pictures of nonfractional quantum mechanics. In the present,
subsection, we consider the Schr¨odinger picture of time FQM.
In sec. 7.2 the evolution operator U is introduced and then the evolution equation of
an operator A representing an observable is obtained. We now consider these for time FSE
[28].
Let us write ψ(x, t) = Uβ(t, t0)ψ(x, t0), iβ∂
βψ/∂tβ = Hψ and assume that V is inde￾pendent of time. Use of the above ψ in the time FSE gives the fractional operator equation
for Uβ as

Uβ(t, t0) = HUβ(t, t0). (22.119)

gives

where Eβ(z) is the Muttag–Leffler function. Note that for β = 1 we find Eβ(z) = ez and
U1 = e−iHt which is the standard evolution operator. One can easily verify that U
†
βUβ 6= 1,
that is, Uβ is not unitary [28] and U
†
1U1 = 1. For the determination of ψ(x, t) of certain
time fractional quantum systems using Uβ(t, t0) one may refer to the ref. [28].
Next, we find the equation of motion of an operator A. The expectation value of A is
hAiβ =

∗Aψdx = hψ|A|ψi. (22.123)

is not zero and hence hAiβ is not a constant of motion. When β = 1

the framework of fractional time derivative by solving the associated Schr¨odinger equation

For the Eq. (22.155) with time-independent Hamiltonian Hα,β assume the solution as

22.10 Concluding Remarks
The topic FQM forms an attractive application of fractional calculus to quantum mechan￾ics. The developments in this field leads to further understanding of the fundamentals of
quantum theory. The space-time FSE has two fractality parameters α and β. The choice
1 < α < 2 and β = 1 gives space FSE. α = 1 and 0 < β < 1 gives time FSE. The standard
nonfractional Schr¨odinger equation is obtained for α = 2 and β = 1. For the time FSE and
space-time FSE the time-dependence of the solution of the form ψ(x, t) = f(t)ψ(x) is given
by the Mittag–Leffler function.
In FQM the probability is not conserved and the probability current equation has a
nonzero source term. The eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of FSE are known only for a
very few physical systems. A prime difficulty of finding these for FSE is nonlocal character
of the fractional derivatives.
Generalization of FSE considering ultradistribution [32], laser implementation of space
FSE [9] and numerical simulation of FSE [33–35] are reported. Research on physical real￾ization and implementation of FQM is in an initial state. Optics is one promising field in
this aspect [9–12]. The extension of FQM to quantum cosmology has been set [36].

Numerical Methods for Quantum Mechanics
23.1 Introduction
In this book so far we are concerned with the various fundamentals of quantum mechanics.
In the latter part of the century the subject has started growing on multi direction. Newer
quantum phenomena were identified. Quantum version of certain classical phenomena and
concepts have been formulated. New topics in quantum physics have born. Application of
quantum physics to other branches of science and technology has started. For example,
a great deal of research has been focused on the topics such as supersymmetry, Berry’s
phase, Aharonov–Bohm effect, Wigner distribution function, coherent and squeezed states,
quantum computing, quantum cryptography, quantum imaging and quantum lithography
to name a few. Theoretical and experimental progress have been made in these topics. The
fundamentals and the progresses made in these advanced topics are covered in the volume-II
of this book. Before we move on to these advanced topics we wish to mention that in classical
physics several fascinating newer phenomena were first realized in numerical simulation and
then necessary theory and mathematical tools were developed. Thus, it is important to
develop numerical schemes to study quantum systems.
We have seen that solving the Schr¨odinger equation is the central problem of nonrela￾tivistic quantum mechanics. Accurate solutions of the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation
with an arbitrary potential are important for understanding many phenomena in physics.
But exactly solvable Schr¨odinger equations are very limited. Most of the Schr¨odinger equa￾tions cannot be solved analytically. However, number of simple and efficient numerical tech￾niques are developed to study bound and scattering states of quantum mechanical systems.
Particularly, there are techniques which allow us to compute eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
of stationary states and transmission and reflection probabilities in a very accurate way
[1–24]. Such numerical methods are important for the study of complex systems, design and
analysis of quantum effect devices [25,26]. With the advent of modern computer technology,
robust numerical study of various quantum phenomena are now common.
The present chapter is concerned with the study of numerical computation of the
following:
1. Bound state eigenvalues.
2. Bound state eigenfunctions.
3. Ground state eigenvalue and eigenfunction.
4. Transmission and reflection probabilities.
5. Transition probabilities.
6. Electronic distribution in atoms.
There is a simple method developed by van der Maelen Uria, Garcia-Granda and Menendez￾Velazquez [17] to compute stationary states eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for arbitrary

analytical or numerical potentials. In their method, the stationary state equation is trans￾formed into a set of linear finite-difference equations. When these equations are expressed in
a matrix form, (A − λI)ψ = 0, the problem becomes an algebraic eigenvalue problem. The
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of A can be determined numerically and are related to the
energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the original quantum mechanical problem. Chen
[3] extended the matrix method to time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation which is useful to
analyze time evolution of an initial wave function. The final finite-difference formula derived
by Chen is equivalent to the one obtained by Goldberg et al. [1]. A finite-difference time
domain method has been developed by Sudiarta and Geldart [23] for finding stationary
state eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Their method is efficient for the calculation of ground
state eigenvalue and it uses random wave function as an initial wave function.
For a scattering potential Pang [16] described a numerical method which uses numeri￾cal integration of Schr¨odinger equation and function minimization technique to obtain the
solution in the barrier region satisfying appropriate boundary conditions. Wang and Cham￾pagne [24] described a method called coupled channel method for numerical calculation
of transition probabilities for systems with time-dependent perturbations switched-on at
t = 0 and switched-off at t = τ. A simple Monte Carlo simulation for easy visualization of
electronic distribution in atoms is demonstrated by de Aquino et al. [18].
In this chapter, the above methods are presented in detail. The methods are applied to
a number of physically interesting potentials. Numerical results are compared with exact
results wherever possible.
23.2 Matrix Method for Computing Stationary State Solutions
Let us rewrite the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation into the dimensionless form
ψ
′′(x) + 2m
~
2
[E − V (x)]ψ(x) = 0 , x ∈ [xmin, xmax] . (23.1)
A Schr¨odinger equation containing a first derivative term can be transformed into the form
(23.1) by a change of variable. In the numerical simulation, we choose the boundary con￾dition ψ → 0 as x → ±∞ as ψ(xmin) = ψ(xmax) = 0 and we set ~ = 1 and m = 1. ψ is
zero outside the interval [xmin, xmax]. |xmin| and |xmax| are sufficiently large. In the follow￾ing we illustrate the method of van der Maelen Uria et al. [17] for finding eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of (23.1).
23.2.1 Discrete Equivalent of Schrodinger Equation ¨
We discretize the space variable x in the interval [a, b] by choosing the grid of points
x0, x1, . . . , xN with xi+1 − xi = h, where h is a constant. The eigenfunctions will take
values only at these grid of points. That is, ψ will be a set of numbers ψ0, ψ1, . . . , ψN , where
ψi = ψ(xi). Usually ψ0 = ψ(xmin) = 0 and ψN = ψ(xmax) = 0. Now, Eq. (23.1) becomes
the following discrete equation
ψ
′′
i + 2 [E − V (xi)] ψi = 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1. (23.2)
We convert the above equation into a difference equation by replacing ψ
′′
i by a central￾difference formula. A three-point central-difference formula for ψ
′′
i
is
ψ
′′|x=xi =
1
h
2
[ψi+1 − 2ψi + ψi−1] + O(h
2
) . (23.3)Matrix Method for Computing Stationary State Solutions 523
Neglecting the error term and substituting Eq. (23.3) in Eq. (23.2) we obtain
ψi−1 + 2 
h
2E − h
2V (xi) − 1

ψi + ψi+1 = 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1. (23.4)
Let us rewrite Eq. (23.4) as
−ψi−1 + 2 
1 + h
2V (xi) − h
2E

ψi − ψi+1 = 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1. (23.5)
Suppose say N = 4. Then we have the following set of equations
−ψ0 + 2 
1 + h
2V1 − h
2E

ψ1 − ψ2 = 0 , (23.6a)
−ψ1 + 2 
1 + h
2V2 − h
2E

ψ2 − ψ3 = 0 , (23.6b)
−ψ2 + 2 
1 + h
2V3 − h
2E

ψ3 − ψ4 = 0 . (23.6c)
In the above set of equations ψ0 = ψ4 = 0. In matrix form (23.6) is written as


d11 − λ −1 0
−1 d22 − λ −1
0 −1 d33 − λ




ψ1
ψ2
ψ3

 = 0 , (23.7)
where dii = 2 
1 + h
2V (xi)

and λ = 2h
2E. This is of the form (A− λI)ψ = 0 with A being
symmetric tridiagonal. An N × N matrix A is said to symmetric tridiagonal if
dij = 0, j 6= i − 1,i, i + 1, i = 1, 2, . . . , N
di(i+1) = d(i+1)i
, i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1. (23.8)
For arbitrary value of N the N − 1 coupled linear finite-difference Eqs. (23.4) are ex￾pressed in a compact matrix form
(A − λI)ψ = 0 , (23.9a)
with the elements of A and λ are given by
λ = 2h
2E, dii = 2 
1 + h
2V (xi)

, i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1
di(i+1) = d(i+1)i = −1, i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 2
dij = 0, j =6 i − 1,i, i + 1, i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1 (23.9b)
and I is the unit matrix. That is, the original differential eigenvalue problem now becomes
an algebraic eigenvalue problem. Note that the calculation of E and ψ of the stationary
states of a given quantum mechanical system is reduced to the calculation of λ and ψ of the
matrix A. For nontrivial solution of (A − λI)ψ = 0 we require |A − λI| = 0 from which we
can compute the eigenvalues of A and then the energy eigenvalues E. Then we can compute
ψ from Aψ = λψ.
23.2.2 Computation of Eigenvalues of the Matrix A
How do we compute the eigenvalues of the matrix A? Interestingly, the matrix A is a
symmetric tridiagonal. For a symmetric tridiagonal matrix efficient algorithms are available
to calculate λ. An iterative method is the Jacobi method, but it is very slow for matrices
of order greater than, say, ten. An alternate and more efficient technique is QL algorithm
[27, 28]. This algorithm is presented in appendix F.524 Numerical Methods for Quantum Mechanics
We note that the truncation error in the finite-difference approximation of the second
derivative term, Eq. (23.3), is proportional to h
2
. The error can be made proportional to
h
4 using Richardson’s extrapolation. This technique is the following. Suppose E
(1)
i
(h) and
E
(2)
i
(αh) are two approximate values of Ei obtained by a method of order p with step size
h and αh, respectively. Then we can write
E
(1)
i
(h) = Ei(0) + chp + O(h
2p
) , (23.10a)
E
(2)
i
(αh) = Ei(0) + cαph
p + O(h
2p
) . (23.10b)
Multiplying of Eq. (23.10a) by α
p and subtracting it from (23.10b) gives
Ei(0) = α
pE
(1)
i − E
(2)

αp − 1
+ O(h
2p

The above formula is known as Richardson’s extrapolation. For h = h1, αh = h2, α = h2/h1
and p = 2 Eq. (23.11) becomes
Ei(more accurate) = 1

The eigenvalues of the given quantum system may be infinite in number. Since A is
(N − 1) × (N − 1) matrix in the numerical computation we get only N − 1 eigenvalues, a
subset of the possible eigenvalues.
23.2.3 Computation of the Eigenfunctions of the Matrix A
An eigenfunction of the matrix A for an eigenvalue is obtained by solving the algebraic
eigenvalue problem, Eq. (23.9), where λ (= 2h
2E) is a given eigenvalue. We write the
Eq. (23.9a) (after redefining N − 1 as N) and Ai = dii − λ as

We have to normalize any admissible eigenfunction. Let Cψ is the normalized eigenfunc￾tion, where C is the normalization constant. C can be determined from the normalization
condition

∗ψ dx = 1 . (23.14)
Therefore, keeping this in mind, in the numerical scheme we choose ψ1 = 1 and compute
other ψi
’s from (23.13). The first row in Eq. (23.13) gives
ψ2 = A1ψ1 (from row 1) . (23.15)
That is, use row 1 to compute ψ2, use row 2 to compute ψ3 and so on. From rows 2 to N −2
we have
ψ3 = −ψ1 + A2ψ2 (from row 2) ,
ψ4 = −ψ2 + A3ψ3 (from row 3) ,
.
.
.
ψN−1 = −ψN−3 + AN−2ψN−2 (from row N − 2) . (23.16)Matrix Method for Computing Stationary State Solutions 525
Note that (N − 2)th row gives ψN−1. Since, (N − 1)th and Nth rows are not yet used and
only ψN to be determined, we add these last two rows and obtain a single new equation.
From this new equation we compute ψN :
ψN =
1
1 − AN
[−ψN−2 − (1 − AN−1) ψN−1] . (23.17)
To summarize, with ψ1 = 1, ψ2 = A1ψ1, the expressions for ψ3, . . . , ψN−1 are
ψi = −ψi−2 + Ai−1ψi−1 , i = 3, 4, . . . , N − 1 (23.18)
and ψN is given by the Eq. (23.17). The computed eigenfunction is unnormalized. To nor￾malize it we calculate the normalization constant C from Eq. (23.14). We can evaluate the
integral in Eq. (23.14), for example, using the composite trapezoidal rule:

23.2.4 Application
We apply the method to three quantum mechanical systems and compare the numerically
computed eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with the exact values.
23.2.4.1 Harmonic Oscillator
For the linear harmonic oscillator potential V (x) = kx2/2 with k = 1 the exact eigenvalues
are Ee = (n+ 1/2), n = 0, 1, . . .. It is easy to develop a program to compute the eigenvalues
by the QL method (see the exercise 23.1 at the end of the present chapter). In order to get
a more accurate result, the eigenvalues are computed for two values of h, h1 and h2. Then
using the Richardson’s extrapolation more accurate values of E are obtained. Table 23.1
presents first few eigenvalues computed with h1 = 0.1 and h2 = 0.05, by extrapolation and
exact values. Here xmin = −10 and xmax = 10. Accuracy can be improved by reducing the
values of h1 and h2 and choosing large values of xmin and xmax.
The exact ground state eigenfunction is given by ψ(x) = (1/π)
1/4
e
−x
2/2
. Table 23.2 gives
the numerically computed ground state eigenfunction values at some selected grid points
for three values of h where xmin = −5 and xmax = 5 (for a complete program to compute
a normalized eigenfunction see the exercise 23.3 at the end of the present chapter). ψ(x)
approaches the exact result as h decreases. Very good agreement with exact eigenfunction is
observed for other values of E also. The numerical solution is symmetric with respect to the
origin. This solution is called an even-parity solution. An odd-parity solution can be obtained
by choosing ψ(xmin) = −1. Figure 23.1 shows the numerically computed eigenfunctions for
E = 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5. For E = 0.5 and 2.5 the value of ψ(xmin) is set as 1 whereas for
E = 1.5 and 3.5 the value of ψ(xmin) is set as −1.
23.2.4.2 Square-Well Potential
As a second example consider the square-well potential (5.23) which admits only a finite
number of bound states. Its exact energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are determined in
sec. 5.3. In the numerical computation, we fix V0 as 35 and a = 1 for which only 6 bound
states exist. The numerical (exact) energy eigenvalues are computed as 0.98336 (0.98336),
3.92084 (3.92084), 8.77009 (8.77009), 15.43900 (15.43901), 23.71532 (23.71539) and 32.84380
(32.84389). In the numerical simulation, we get eigenvalues above 35 also which are closely
spaced and we can treat them as forming continuous spectrum. Figure 23.2 shows the
numerically computed and exact energy eigenfunctions ψ0, ψ1 and ψ5 corresponding to the
energy eigenvalues E0 = 0.98336, 3.92084 and 32.8438, respectively.526 Numerical Methods for Quantum Mechanics

The exact energy eigenvalues are −1/(2n

calculated numerically with h1 = 0.1, h2 = 0.05 and by extrapolation. The last column is
the exact E. Here, r range is fixed as r ∈ (0, 100). E1 to E5 are identical to the exact values
within 5 decimal accuracy. Other values deviate from the exact energy values. As mentioned
earlier, accuracy can be improved by choosing large value for maximum value of r and small
values for h1 and h2. Table 23.4 illustrates the influence of b = rmax on the energy values
E1 to E5. As expected these values converge to the exact values as the value of b increases.
Moreover, the number of negative values of E increases with the increase in the values of
b. For b = 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 the number of negative values of E are 8, 12, 15, 17

23.3 Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method
There is another method called finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method introduced
by Sudiarta and Geldart [20] for computation of energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of
time-independent Schr¨odinger equation. Their method can be easily extended for higher￾dimensional systems. In the FDTD method, the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation is
discretized using a central-difference formula in both time and space. Using different initial
wave function we can obtain various eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions. The
method with random initial wave function is efficient in obtaining ground state eigenvalue
and eigenfunction.530 Numerical Methods for Quantum Mechanics

23.3.2 Finite-Difference Algorithm [23]
Because the bound state wave functions are localized, in the numerical simulation we con￾sider finite region of space. Let x ∈ [xmin, xmax] and similarly for the y and z variables.
We divide the x, y and z ranges into discrete lattice sites with spacing between the sites
given by ∆x = (xmax − xmin)/Nx, where Nx + 1 is the number of lattice points along the
x-direction. The lattice points xi are given by xi = xmin + i∆x, i = 0, 1, . . . , Nx. Like-wise,
define ∆y, ∆z, yi and zi
. We denote the temporal increment as ∆τ. The wave function
ψ(x, y, z, τ) = ψ(xi
, yj, zk, τn) or ψ(i∆x, j∆y, k∆z, n∆τ) is denoted as ψ
n
(i, j, k).
To discretize the time and space derivative in Eq. (23.25) we use the forward- and
central-difference schemes, respectively, given by

The boundary condition is ψ(x, y, z)boundary = 0. We note that since the final wave function
ψ0(x, y, z, τ) is proportional to e−E0τ
, the magnitude of the final wave function may generally
be quite small. For this reason we normalize the initial wave function and the wave function
after each iteration. If ψ is a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation then −ψ is also a solution.
The normalized ψ(x, y, z, τ = large) can be either +ψS or −ψS, where ψS is a stationary
state wave function.
Solved Problem 1:
Obtain the stability condition for the FDTD scheme.
The stability of the method, that is, the condition for the error occurred at a stage of
computation to decay, can be analyzed by the Fourier method (also called von Neumann
analysis) [29]. To determine the stability condition consider the FDTD algorithm for the
one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation. In this case (23.29) becomes

23.3.3 Application
In the following we apply the FDTD method to certain one- and two-dimensional systems.
23.3.3.1 One-Dimensional Linear Harmonic Oscillator
The ground and first excited states eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the time-independent
Schr¨odinger equation of the linear harmonic oscillator with the potential V (x) = x

We choose x ∈ [−5, 5], ∆x = 0.01, ∆τ = (∆x)
2/5 and the initial wave function as a random
wave function, that is ψ(xi
, 0) = ξi
, where ξi
’s are uniform random numbers in the interval
[−0.5, 0.5] generated using Park–Miller method (see appendix G). The boundary condition
is ψ(−5, 0) = ψ(5, 0) = 0. ψ(x, τ) is normalized after every iteration. Figure 23.4a shows
energy E versus τ. As τ increases E approaches the ground state energy value E0 = 0.5.
In Fig. 23.4b an arbitrary wave function evolves to the ground state wave function (−ψ0).
Figures 23.4c and 23.4d show E versus τ and ψ(x, τ) versus τ, respectively, where the initial
wave function is chosen as ψ(x, τ = 0) = N sin 6x, N being the normalization constant.
E → E1 = 1.5 and ψ(x, τ) → −ψ1. Other excited energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
can be obtained with different initial wave function. The values of E0 and E1 obtained are
0.4999969 and 1.499984, respectively.

in Fig. 23.5b.
23.3.3.3 One-Dimensional Anharmonic Oscillator
Another important quantum system is the anharmonic oscillator with the potential V (x) =
(x
2 − 2)2
. It is a double-well system and is used to describe structural phase transitions,
tunnelling of protons in hydrogen bonded systems and many other systems. Exact eigenval￾ues and eigenfunctions of the anharmonic oscillator is not known. Its ground state energy
obtained by an another method [30] is 1.80081. The ground state energy eigenvalue obtained
by the FDTD method is 1.80078, where we used ∆x = 0.01, ∆τ = (∆x)
2/5 and x ∈ [−5, 5].
Figures 23.5c and 23.5d present the results of the FDTD method.
23.3.3.4 Two-Dimensional Systems
Next, we consider the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with the potential V (x, y) =
(x
2 + y

)/2. Its exact ground state energy is 1. In the numerical simulation, we choose
x, y ∈ [−5, 5], ∆x = ∆y = 0.05, ∆τ = (∆x)
2/5 and ψ(x, y, τ = 0) as a random function.

is 9.866358 while the exact value is 9.869604. For ∆x = 0.01 the obtained energy value is
9.868793. That is, accuracy can be improved by decreasing ∆x, ∆y and ∆τ.
23.4 Time-Dependent Schrodinger Equation ¨
In sec. 23.2 we described the finite-difference matrix method for computing energy eigen￾values and eigenfunctions of bound states of time-independent Schr¨odinger equation in one￾dimension. In the present section, we consider the problem of solving the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation. Interestingly, the finite-difference scheme can be extended to the
study of time development of certain initial wave profile [3]. We note that solving the
time-independent Schr¨odinger equation is a boundary-value problem while solving the time￾dependent Schr¨odinger equation is essentially an initial-value problemTime-Dependent Schro¨dinger Equation 535

The above equation is of the form Aψ = B. An interesting observation on the matrix A
is that it is a symmetric tridiagonal form and can be solved easily. The system given by
Eq. (23.41) can be solved by the QL algorithm described in appendix F.

. Numerically compute
ψ(x, t) and state its behaviour.
For numerical computation we choose ∆x = 0.05, ∆t = 0.01, x ∈ [−5, 5]. Since the
Schr¨odinger equation is a complex equation, ψ(x, t) is complex even if ψ(x, 0) is a pure real.
Therefore, ψ(x, t) is declared as a complex variable in the numerical algorithm of solving
the Eq. (23.41). Real and imaginary parts of complex ψ are obtained as
ψR = [ψ + conjg(ψ)]/2, ψI = −i[ψ − conjg(ψ)]/2, (23.42)

23.4.3 Particle in the Presence of a Step Potential
Next, we consider a step potential V (x) = 0 for x ≤ x0 and V0 for x > x0 which has no
bound states. The incident wave function undergoes reflection and refraction.

for V0 = 5, 10 and 50. In Figs. 23.10a and 23.10b for
V0 = 5 and 10 we note that part of the incident wave is reflected while the remaining part
is refracted. The amplitude of the reflected wave is relatively larger for V0 = 10. We expect
complete reflection for sufficiently large value of V0. This is the case shown in Figs. 23.10c

23.4.4 Tunnelling
Now, we show that tunnelling phenomenon can also be captured by numerically solving
the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation by the finite-difference method. We consider the
rectangular barrier potential with height V0 and width 0.1. That is, V (x) = V0 for x ∈ [5, 5.1]
and 0 elsewhere. We choose the initial wave function as e−x
2+i5x and fix ∆x = ∆t = 0.05
and x ∈ [−10, 20]. The time evolution of ψR is shown in Fig. 23.12 for V0 = 5, 20 and 500.

(see Fig. 23.12c) ψR is almost negligible in magnitude for x > 5.1.
23.4.5 Wave Packet Revivals
In the final example, we consider a particle bouncing on a perfectly reflecting surface under
the influence of gravity. The potential of the particle is V (x) = mgx for x > 0 and ∞ for
x < 0. We illustrated the wave packet revival phenomenon in this system in sec. 10.3. Now,
we show that this feature can also be reproduced through numerical simulation. Figure 23.13542 Numerical Methods for Quantum Mechanics

wave packet revival.
23.5 Quantum Scattering
Having studied how to compute eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of stationary states of quan￾tum mechanical systems we turn our attention to scattering potentials. A systematic numer￾ical procedure for computing transmission coefficient was described by Pang [16]. We show
how transmission probability of quantum mechanical barriers can be computed numerically.
Quantum mechanical scattering and tunnelling problems in one-dimension are described
by the Schr¨odinger equation

where ~

dy1
dx
= y2 ,
dy2
dx
= 2[V (x) − E]y1 , (23.49)
where y1 = ψ. Assume that V (x) is nonzero only in the region x ∈ [0, a] and the incident
particle comes from the left with a unit flux. The general solution of Eq. (23.48) is written
as
ψ(x) = 

(23.50Quantum Scattering 543
where the parameters B and C are generally complex and are to be determined. The wave
vector k is p
2mE/~
2 =
√
2E. The solution ψ(x) in the region x ∈ [0, a] is to be obtained
numerically.
The complex solution and its first derivative satisfy the continuity conditions at x = 0
and a. These conditions are
ψ(0) = 1 + B, ψ(a) = C, (23.51a)
ψ
′
(0) = ik(1 − B), ψ′
(a) = ikC. (23.51b)
Once the constants B and C are known the transmission and reflections probabilities are
obtained from the relations T = |C|
2
, R = |B|
2 and T + R = 1.
23.5.1 Numerical Solution in the Region 0 ≤ x ≤ a
Now, the intricate problem is to determine the solution of Eq. (23.48) in the region x ∈ [0, a]
obeying the continuity conditions, Eq. (23.51). The correct solution is obtained using the
numerical procedure outlined below. The procedure consists of four main steps.
1. For a given potential barrier and energy value make an initial guess for the pa￾rameter B = Br + iBi with |Br|, |Bi
| ≤ 1. We can choose Br = α, Bi =
√
1 − α2,
|α| ≤ 1.
2. Integrate Eq. (23.49) from x = 0 to a using, say, the fourth-order Runge–Kutta
method with the initial condition y1(0) = 1 + B and y2(0) = ik(1 − B). This is
only a trial solution and not the solution satisfying the conditions, Eqs. (23.51).
3. From Eqs. (23.51) we have two expressions for C:
C = C1 = y1(a), C = C2 = −
i
k
y2(a) . (23.52)
These two values depend on the values of Br and Bi
. Compute C1 and C2 from
Eq. (23.52).
4. We require C1 = C2. This will happen when the trial solution is exact. Introduce
the function
F = |C1 − C2|
2
. (23.53)
Minimize the function F by varying y1(a) and y2(a) so that F ≈ 0. When this is
achieved C1 and C2 are identical.
23.5.2 Minimization of F
A simple method of minimization of a multivariable continuous function is the Nelder–Mead
simplex (NMS) method [28]. The method is simple, effective and computationally compact.
For the basic idea of the method with an example see the exercise 23.12 at the end of this
chapter. The method starts with (N + 1) initial guess for an N-dimension function.
For the function F given by Eq. (23.53), C1 = C1R + iC1I, C2 = C2R + iC2I. If real and
imaginary components are treated as separate variables then F is a function of 4 variables,
that is N = 4. Therefore, 5 initial guesses on B are needed. Br and Bi are chosen as
BR = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1 and BI =
p
1 − B2
R
. The variables B, C, y1 and y2 are complex
functions. Therefore, the Eqs. (23.49), (23.51), (23.52) and (23.53) are rewritten as follows544 Numerical Methods for Quantum Mechanics
by treating real and imaginary parts separately so that the variables involved are all real:

y1R(0) = 1 + BR, y1I(0) = BI
, (23.55a)
y2R(0) = kBI
, y2I(0) = k(1 − BR), (23.55b)

For the chosen 5 set of values of (BR, BI) the corresponding y’s at x = a are obtained by
solving the Schr¨odinger equation by the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. After this step,
NMS method is used to find correct y1(a) and y2(a) for which F ≈ 0. Minimization of F
is performed actually by varying y1(a) and y2(a) and not by directly varying BR and BI
.
The transmission probability T and the reflection probability R are then computed from
the expressions T = |C|

Solved Problem 3:
A standard example for a quantum tunnelling is the square-barrier potential V (x) = V0

transmission probability T and compare it with the exact T .

Suppose a = 5 and V0 = 1. Step size in the Runge–Kutta method is h = 0.01. Tolerance
in the NMS method is fixed as 10−6
. Developing a program to compute T as a function of
energy is given as an exercise (see the exercise 23.13 at the end of this chapter).
Figure 23.14 shows numerically computed T , Tnum, as a function of E. Table 23.5
presents the values of Tnum, Texa, Texa − Tnum and percentage of error, 100 × |(Tnum −

T is observed. The accuracy can be improved by choosing smaller values of step size h in
the Runge–Kutta method and the tolerance value in the NMS method.Quantum Scattering 545

finite number of identical square-barriers. The potential is given by

increases with increase in N. For N = 1, 2 and 4 the Tnum is always greater than zero. But
for large N, for example N = 10 (Fig. 23.15d), Tnum is zero or ≈ 0 for a range of E. Thus,
for large N, by suitably choosing E, V0 and a we can have almost complete transmission or
complete reflection.Electronic Distribution of Hydrogen Atom 547
23.6 Electronic Distribution of Hydrogen Atom
The Monte Carlo technique can be used to represent electronic distribution of hydrogen
atom [18], particles distribution in harmonic oscillator, tunnelling through a potential barrier
and scattering of particles from a potential. In this section, the electronic distribution of
hydrogen atom is considered.
Let us consider the ground state of hydrogen atom. It is given by ψnlm = ψ100 =
(1/
√
π )e−r
. The probability density for the electron is P100(r) = |ψ100|
2 = e−2r/π. If we
consider Cartesian coordinate system then r
2 = x
2 + y
2 + z
2
. For the present discussion
the multiplicative factor 1/π in P100 is dropped so that P100 = e−2r
. Suppose we wish to
obtain electronic distribution in x − y − z plane. Monte Carlo technique can be employed
to this problem. For convenience let us choose the plane x − z with y = 0. Essentially, a
sequence of N pair of points (x, z) with the distribution P100 = e−2r
represent the electronic
distribution in ground state. Thus, the problem is to generate a set of numbers {(x, z)} with
the probability distribution P100.
How do we generate {(x, z)} with P100 = e−2r? A sequence of numbers with a desired
distribution can be obtained using the simple and efficient random sampling technique
called accept-reject or simply rejection method. This method is described in appendix G for
a function f(x). This method can be easily extended for f(x, z).
23.6.1 Rejection Technique to Generate Random Numbers with the
Distribution e
−(x
2+z
2
)
Let f(x, z) be the desired distribution defined over the interval x ∈ [ax, bx], z ∈ [az, bz].
Select a suitable bounding function cg(x, z) with maximum of cg(x, z) = cgm is ≥ maximum
of f(x, z). For the exponential function e−(x
2+z
2
) we may choose x ∈ [−10, 10], z ∈ [−10, 10]
and maximum of cg(x, z) as cgm = 1 since the maximum of e−(x
2+z
2
)
is 1 (cgm must be ≥ 1).
Now, treat x and z are as uniformly distributed random numbers in the range [−10, 10] and
cg(x, z) as uniformly distributed random numbers in the range [0, 1] since f(x, z) ∈ [0, 1].
Then the scheme is the following:
1. Choose a value for x and a value for z.
2. Choose a value for cg(x, z).
3. Compute f(x, z).
4. If f(x, z) ≤ cg(x, z) accept the pair (x, z). Otherwise reject it.
Repeating the above algorithm we can generate a desired number of (x, z). The obtained
pairs of numbers obey the chosen distribution f(x, z). Using the above method we can
generate any number of pairs of random numbers (or in general n-dimensional random
numbers) satisfying a given distribution.
23.6.2 Electronic Distribution in Various States
A program can be developed to generate a sequence of, say, N = 2000 pairs of points (x, z)
with f(x, z) = P(x, y = 0, z) = e−2r
(see the exercise 17 at the end of this chapter). This
corresponds to ground state nlm = 100. The values of a, b and cgm are chosen as −10, 10 and
1, respectively. The plot of x versus z represents electronic distribution of hydrogen atom
in ground state. To obtain the distribution in other states the corresponding expression for
P(x, y, z) is to be used. Further, we have to choose appropriate values for a, b and cgm.
These values for some of the states are mentioned in the program. Figure 23.16 displays the548 Numerical Methods for Quantum Mechanics

pose the problem in a slightly different manner. Suppose the perturbation is switched-on at

time T it settles on to the state m. In numerical simulation we choose a small number of

coupled ordinary differential equations which we can solve by the fourth-order Runge–Kutta

In the numerical study fix ~ = 1, M = 1, ωL = ω = 0.2π and f0 = 0.2. At t = 0,
assume that the system is in its ground state. In this case, an(0) = δn0. We consider five
channels, that is, N = 4. ωmn = (m − n)ω, m, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Equations (23.64) (totally 10
coupled equations) are integrated numerically using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method
with step size ∆t = 0.01. Figure 23.17 shows log10 |an|

τ = 10, |a0|
2 ≫ |an|

while other |an|

increases. When τ = 40, for t > τ, we notice |a0|
2 < |an|
2
, n = 1, 2, 3, 4.
That is, the probabilities for the transitions from ground state to neighbouring excited
states are larger than finding the system in the ground state for t > τ. For all values of τ,
the excitation probability increases with time rapidly and shows a plateau character near
the end of the laser pulse, that is t ≈ τ.
In Fig. 23.18 τ is kept as 10 while an(0) is varied. For an(0) = δn0, |a0|

of neighbouring energy levels to mth level increases.Concluding Remarks 551

23.8 Concluding Remarks
Accurate numerical methods are essential for studying quantum phenomena for the systems
with complicated potentials. It has been found that accurate determination of ionization
rates require a very careful numerical study. The numerical methods considered in this
chapter are very general and can be applied to more complicated potentials. The methods
described in this chapter are useful for the design and analysis of properties and functions of
nanoelectronic devices which utilize the nonlinear current-voltage relation of the quantum
tunnelling of the electrons.552 Numerical Methods for Quantum Mechanics

A finite-element method [15] and matrix method [31] were developed for solving the
one-dimensional quantum tunnelling problem. A (t, t′
) method was introduced for analyzing
propagation of an initial state in explicit time-dependent Hamiltonians [32,33]. A numerical
algorithm employing Crank–Nicholson approximation for the time dependence along with a
Numerov extension for the discrete transparent boundary conditions was described in [34].
Numerical methods are available for the computation of phase shift and total scattering
cross-section. Numerical visualization of quantum matrix diagonalization was reported [35].Bibliography 553
Monte Carlo simulation can also be used for ground state energy calculation. For a detailed
discussion on such numerical schemes one may refer to [36].

Calculation of Numerical Values of h and kB
Planck, in his novel paper entitled On the energy distribution in the black body spectrum [1]
presented the calculation of the values of the universal constants h and kB. Planck calculated

A Derivation of the Factor hν/(ehν/kBT − 1)
Let us consider a box with n identical photons and an atom inside it [1]. The probability
that the atom will emit a photon is (n+ 1)|a|
2
, where |a|
2
is the probability the atom would
emit if no photons were present. The probability that the atom would absorb a photon is
n|a|
2
.
Suppose we consider a cavity with N atoms and each atom has, say, two energy levels.
We denote Nl and Nh be the average number of atoms in the lower and higher states,
respectively. Then at temperature T the ratio Nh/Nl
is given by
Nh
Nl
=
e
−Eh/kBT
e−El/kBT
= e−(Eh−El)/kBT
. (B.1)
Now, each atom in the lower state can absorb a photon and jump to the higher state
Eh. Like-wise each atom in the energy level Eh can go into El by emitting a photon. In
equilibrium the rate of emission and absorption must be same. If ¯n is the average number
of photons in a given state then the rate of absorption and emission for photons are Nln¯|a|
2
and Nh(¯n + 1)|a|
2
, respectively. Then Nln¯ = Nh(¯n + 1) or
Nh
Nl
=
n¯
(¯n + 1) . (B.2)
Using Eq. (B.1) for Nh/Nl we get
n¯
(¯n + 1) = e−(Eh−El)/kBT
. (B.3)
From the above equation we find
n¯ =
1
e
(Eh−El)/kBT − 1
(B.4)

Bose’s Derivation of Planck’s Law
In this appendix we present Bose’s derivation [1] of Planck’s law without using the wave
aspects of light quanta. Bose made the following three assumptions:
1. Light quanta are indistinguishable.
2. For light quanta the number of particles is conserved.
3. There exists a two-fold degeneracy for each momentum state.
Let a radiation of total energy is enclosed in a volume V and each light quanta is charac￾terized by the number N and energy hνs (s = 0 to ∞). We write
E =
X
s
Nshνs = V
Z
ρνdν . (C.1)
We need to find Ns. Bose reasoned that if one could state the probability for any distribution
characterized by a set of Ns then it could be determined by the requirement that the
probability be maximum satisfying (C.1).
The momenta of the quanta satisfy p

Equation (C.2) indicates that if the phase space is divided into cells of magnitude h

then
the number of cells in the frequency range dν is 4πV (ν

)dν. In order to take into account
the polarization the above quantity is multiplied by 2 then it is 8πV (ν

Now, define Ns be the number of quanta belonging to the frequency range dν

Distinction Between Self-Adjoint and Hermitian
Operators
As mentioned in sec. 3.2 an action and domain constitute an operator. The reason for
the specification of domain is that in quantum mechanics the operators representing the
observables should be Hermitian. Let us bring out the difference between self-adjoint and
Hermitian operators with an example [1,2].
For simplicity we consider the one-dimensional free particle confined in the region [0, ∞].
Its Hamiltonian is H = −d
2/dx
2
, where we have set ~
2/(2m) = 1. The particle is confined
to the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ ∞ and hence there must be an infinite barrier at x = 0. Hence,
φ(0) = 0. Suppose H acts on φ(x). We are interested in the functions φ(x) with
Z ∞
0
|φ(x)|
2
dx = finite, φ(x) → 0 as x → ∞ . (D.1)
Such a set of functions specify the domain (domain is the set of specified functions on which
an operator acts) of the operator H and we call it as D. D can be a subset of a domain
L[0, ∞] which includes above square-integrable functions and other types of functions.
Find the adjoint of H. We obtain

n(0) = 0 . (D.4)
Now, consider the set of functions φ with φ(x) → 0 as x → ∞ and φ(0) = 0. Then φn(0) = 0,
φ
∗
m(0) = 0 and the Eq. (D.4) is satisfied so that
(φm, Hφn) = ￾
H
†φm, φn

. (D.5)
Hence, H† = −d
2/dx
2
is the adjoint of H = −d
2/dx
2
. In Eq. (D.5) the action of H and
H†
is defined on the set of functions with φ(0) = 0. Thus, in Eq. (D.5) the action and the
domain of the operator H on φn in left-side is equal to the action and the domain of H†

on φm in the right-side. Precisely, H† = H and D(H) = D(H†
). An operator A with the
property D(A) = D(A†
) is called a self-adjoint operator . For the set of functions φ with
φ(0) = 0 (and φ(x) → 0 as x → ∞) H is a self-adjoint as shown above.
Next, we consider the same operator H = −d
2/dx
2 but with the conditions φn(0) = 0,
φ
′
n(0) = 0, φm(x), φn(x) → 0 as x → ±∞. Is the operator H with the above conditions
self-adjoint? The domain of H is the set of functions with φ(0) = 0, φ
′
(0) = 0. The action of
H†
is on φm and the boundary expression (D.4) is satisfied for arbitrary values of φ
∗
m(0) and
φ

m
′
(0) still giving the result H† = H. Thus, the domain of H†
is larger than the domain of
H and D(H) ⊂ D(H†
). Such an operator is called a Hermitian operator .
From the above discussion we define Hermitian and self-adjoint operators as follows [1,2]:
Consider an operator with a dense domain D(A) and denote the domain of its adjoint A†
as D(A†
) such that for all φ and ψ ∈ D(A) we have
￾
φ, A†ψ

=
￾
A
†φ, ψ
. (D.6)
An operator A which has same action of A†
is said to be (i) Hermitian if D(A) ⊂ D(A†
)
and (ii) self-adjoint if D(A) = D(A†
).

For ψ1 = 0, the inequality is obviously satisfied. For ψ1 6= 0, we decompose ψ2 into a part
parallel to ψ1 and a part orthogonal to ψ1:
ψ2 = zψ1 + χ with (ψ1, χ) = 0 . (E.4)
Then
(ψ1, ψ2) = z (ψ1, ψ1) (E.5)
which gives
z =

Eigenvalues of a Symmetric Tridiagonal
Matrix --- QL Method
Suppose we have a system of linear simultaneous equations of the form (A − λI)X = 0
where A be a N × N matrix, λ is a parameter and X be a vector of dimension N. This
linear system has a nontrivial solution if and only if the determinant of A − λI is zero:
det(A − λI) = 0. This can be written as








a11 − λ a12 . . . a1N
a21 a22 − λ . . . a2N
. . .
aN1 aN2 . . . aNN − λ








= 0. (F.1)
Expanding the above determinant, one gets a polynomial of degree N:
P(λ) = (−1)N
￾
λ
N + α1λ
N−1 + . . . + αN−1λ + αN

. (F.2)
This equation will have N roots for λ. (A − λI)X = 0 will have a nontrivial solution only
for the N roots of λ. The λ’s are called eigenvalues of A.
For a symmetric N × N matrix all the eigenvalues can be computed numerically, by
first reducing it into a symmetric tridiagonal matrix using Householder method and then
employing QL method to the reduced matrix [1,2]. Here, we describe the QL method for
finding all the eigenvalues of symmetric tridiagonal matrix of the form
A =


a1 d1 0 . . . 0
d1 a2 d2 . . . 0



. (F.3)
In the QL method the matrix A1 = A is factorized into the form A1 = Q1L1, where Q1 = Q
is an orthogonal matrix and L1 = L is a lower triangular matrix. Actually, a matrix PN−1
is constructed so that the element in the location (N − 1, N) in the matrix PN−1A is zero.
That is,
PN−1A =


a1 d1 0
d1 a2 d2
. . .
qN−2 pN−1 0
rN−2 qN−1 pN


. (F.4)
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172178-F 56568 Eigenvalues of a Symmetric Tridiagonal Matrix --- QL Method
Similarly, with a suitable PN−2 the element in the position (N − 2, N − 1) of PN−1A can
be set into zero. Repeating this procedure N − 1 times we obtain
P1P2 . . . PN−1A =



q1 p2 0

rN−3 qN−2 pN−1 0

. (F.5)
Now, we define a matrix Q as Q1 = P
T
N−1P
T
N−2
. . . P T

. Then we form the product A2 =
L1Q1. We note that the matrix Q1 is orthogonal. Therefore, QT
1 A1 = QT
1 Q1L1 = L1. Thus,
A2 = QT
1 A1Q1 = Q
−1
1 A1Q1. A2 is similar to A1 and have the same eigenvalues. In general,
Ak = QkLk and Ak+1 = QT
k AkQk. Ak+1 is similar to Ak and hence have the same structure.
Next, consider the case of setting the element Apq and Aqp to zero. In this case P1 has
the form
P1 =


1 . . .
c . . . s
. . .
−s . . . c
1


. (F.6)
Note that all the diagonal elements of P1 are 1 except for the element c. The c appears at
two places. All off-diagonal elements of P are 0 except for the elements s which appears at
two places.
The tridiagonal form of A2 indicates that it also has zeros below the lower diagonal.
From a detailed calculation one can find that the terms rj are used only to compute these
zero elements. The point is that in writing a computer program the rj ’s need not be stored.
For each Pj it is sufficient to store the coefficients sj and cj . Moreover, we need not compute
and store Q explicitly. In fact, we can use sj ’s and cj’s to find the product
A2 = LQ = LP T
N−1P
T

. . . P T

. (F.7)
We can speed up the process employing the shifting technique. Here, we can make use of
the fact that if λj is an eigenvalue of A then λj − si
is an eigenvalue of A− siI. This results
in
Ai − siI = QiLi
, Ai+1 = LiQi
, for i = 1, 2, . . . , kj (F.8)
with λj = s1 + s2 + . . . + skj
.
We can determine the correct shift required at each step using the four elements in the
upper left corner of the matrix. For example, for the matrix 
a1 d1
d1 a2

the eigenvalues x1
and x2 are the roots of the equation x
2 −(a1 + a2) x+a1a2 −d
2
1 = 0. The root that is closer
to a1 is the value of si
in Eq. (F.8). The QL iteration with shifting is repeated until d1 ≈ 0
which produce λ1 = s1 + s2 + . . . + sk1
. Repeating the process with the lower (n − 1) rows
give d2 ≈ 0 and the next eigenvalue λ2. Next iteration gives dn−2 ≈ 0 and the eigenvalue
λn−2. The quadratic formula can be used to find the last two eigenvalues.
Example:
We find the eigenvalues of the matrix A =


1 −1 0
−1 2 −1
0 −1 1

 employing the QL method.
The exact eigenvalues of the above matrix are λ = 0, 1, 3.Eigenvalues of a Symmetric Tridiagonal Matrix --- QL Method 569
For the given matrix a1 = 1, a2 = 2, d1 = −1 and the quadratic equation is x
2−3x+1 =
0. Its roots are x1 = 2.61803 and x2 = 0.38197. The root close to a1 = 1 is x2. The required
shift is s1 = 0.38197. Then the first shifted matrix is obtained as
A1 − s1I =


0.61803 −1 0
−1 1.61803 −1
0 −1 0.61803


The LQ matrix is computed as
A2 = L1Q1 =


0 0.52573 0
0.52573 0.61803 −0.85065
0 −0.85065 2.23607

 . (F.10)
|d1| = 0.52573 in A is not less than the preassumed small value, say, δ = 10−5
. Therefore, we
perform second iteration with A2. Now, a1 = 0, a2 = 0.61803, d1 = 0.52573 and the roots
of the quadratic equation are x1 = 0.91884, x2 = −0.30081. The second shift is worked out
as s2 = −0.30081. The second shifted matrix is
A2 − s2I =


0.30081 0.52573 0
0.52573 0.91884 −0.85065
0 −0.85065 2.53687

 . (F.11)
Then we obtain the LQ matrix as
A3 = L2Q2 =


−0.07668 −0.06711 0
−0.06711 0.94706 −0.25379
0 −0.25379 2.88615


In the third iteration the shift is s3 = −0.08107. Then we get
A4 = L3Q3 =


−0.00009 0.00001 0
0.00001 1.00358 −0.08565
0 −0.08565 2.99623


The next shift s4 is −0.00009. The LQ matrix is obtained as
A5 = L4Q4 =

0 −0.02860 2.99959

 . (F.14)
In the next iteration s5 = 0 and hence an eigenvalue is obtained as λ1 = s1+s2+s3+s4+s5 =
0. Next, we replace the first diagonal element in A5 by λ1 and write
A5 =


0 0 0
0 1.00041 −0.02860
0 −0.02860 2.99959

The LQ matrix is
A6 = L5Q5 =

0 −0.00953 2.99995


The last two eigenvalues are determined using the 2×2 right-side corner matrix. The roots of
the quadratic equation are x1 = 3 and x2 = 1. Then λ2 = λ1 +x1 = 3 and λ3 = λ1 +x2 = 1.
Therefore, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, 3.570 Eigenvalues of a Symmetric Tridiagonal Matrix --- QL Method

Random Number Generators for Desired
Distributions
A sequence of numbers generated by a random physical process is called random numbers.
Physical processes such as radioactivity decay, thermal noise in electronic devices, cosmic
ray arrival times etc., give rise to a sequence of random numbers. Set of random numbers
can be generated employing simple iterative algorithms. Such numbers are called pseudo
random numbers because they are predictable and reproducible.
A. Uniform Random Number Generator
Consider random numbers in the interval say [α, β]. Suppose we divide the interval
[α, β] into N subintervals with N → ∞. If the random numbers are distributed with equal
probability in each interval then they are called uniform random numbers. In this case the
probability for the random numbers taking values between x and x+ dx is dx/(β − α). The
mean and variance of uniform random numbers are xm = (α + β)/2 and σ
2 = (β − α)
2/12.
For a uniform random numbers in the interval [0, 1] we have xm = 0.5 and σ
2 = 1/12.
Computers themselves have a library routine usually with the name like rnd or ran or
rand to generate uniformly distributed random numbers in the interval [0, 1]. Such a routine
uses the recurrence relation
Ij+1 = aIj + c, mod(m), j ≥ 1 (G.1)
where m is the modulus with m > 0; a is the multiplier with 0 < a < m; c is the increment
with 0 ≤ c ≤ m; I1 is the starting value with 0 ≤ I1 < m. We start with an integer I1 and
calculate aI1+c, which is also an integer. We divide it by m, obtain the remainder and denote
it as I2. Repeating the above procedure we can generate a sequence of integers {I1, I2, . . .}.
The sequence obtained with m = 1000, I1 = 10, a = c = 89 is 979, 220, 669, 630, 159, . . ..
Such a sequence generated from Eq. (G.1) will repeat itself with a period less than m. If we
divide the obtained numbers by m we get a sequence in the interval [0, 1]. We can convert
it into any suitable range [α, β] through xi → (β − α)xi + α.
Park and Miller proposed a generator based on the choices [1]
a = 75
, c = 0, m = 231 − 1 = 2147483647 . (G.2)
When the value of aIj is greater than the maximum value of, say, a 32-bit integer then
we cannot implement the Eqs. (G.1)-(G.2) in a computer. To overcome this problem the
following suggestion of Schrage is very helpful. From the approximate factorization of m
given by
m = aq + r , q = int.[m/a], r = m (mod a), (G.3)
where int denotes integer part. For r < q and 0 < I < m − 1 both aI(mod q) and r.int.[I/q]
lie in the range [0, m − 1]. We can write
aI (mod m) = (
aI (mod q) − r.int.[I/q], if it is > 0
aI (mod q) − r.int.[I/q] + m, otherwise.

With
P1 = I (mod q), P2 = int.[I/q] (G.5)
we rewrite the Eq. (G.4) as
aI (mod a) = (
aP1 − rP2, if it is > 0
aP1 − rP2 + m, otherwise.
(G.6)
Some useful choices of a, q and r are given below: (i) a = 75
, q = 127773, r = 2836, (ii)
a = 48271, q = 44488, r = 3399 and (iii) a = 69621, q = 30845, r = 23702. The period
of the numbers generated using the above procedure is 231 − 2 = 2147483646. The above
procedure generates numbers in the interval [0, m]. Note that the random numbers are now
integers. The numbers generated can be converted into the range [0, 1] by dividing them by
m.
The following steps generate N random numbers in the interval [0, 1].
M = 2147483647
A = 7**5
R = 2836
Q = 127773
I = 3
DO J = 1, N
P1 = MOD(I,Q)
P2 = INT(I/Q)
I = A*P1 - R*P2
IF(I.LE.0) I = I + M
RAN = FLOAT(I)/FLOAT(M)
END DO
Figure G.1a depicts first 100 random numbers of the sequence generated. The mean and
variance obtained with 104 numbers are 0.5017 and 0.0833, respectively, whereas the exact
values are 0.5 and 0.0833 . . ., respectively.
B. Generation of Random Numbers with a Desired Distribution
Using uniform random numbers we can generate random numbers of other types of distri￾bution like Gaussian, exponential, binomial, etc. This can be achieved by employing the
methods such as direct inversion, rejection method and Metropolis. We describe the rejec￾tion technique [2].
Suppose f(x) be the desired distribution defined over the interval [α, β]. We select a
suitable bounding function g(x) such that cg(x) ≥ f(x) for all values of α ≤ x ≤ β. For
the exponential function f(x) = e−x
2
for α ≤ x ≤ β and 0 otherwise we can choose the
range [α, β] as [−5, 5]. Since f(x) ≤ 1 for x ∈ [α, β] we have cg(x) ≥ 1. We set c = 1 so
that g(x) ∈ [0, 1]. We choose g(x) and x as uniformly distributed random numbers in the
intervals [0, 1] and [−5, 5], respectively. The scheme is the following.
1. Choose a value of x randomly in the interval [−5, 5] and calculate f(x).
2. Choose a value of cg(x), the value of g(x) is between 0 and 1, and call it y.
3. If y > f(x) then go to step (1) otherwise x is a member of the chosen distribution
number.Random Number Generators for Desired Distributions 573

We can obtain a sequence of random numbers with the distribution f(x) by repeating
the above steps. The procedure is simply the following. Consider the Fig. G.2a. The dots
are the points with coordinate values (xi
, yi) with xi ∈ [−5, 5] and yi ∈ [0, cg] (= [0, 1]).
Discard the points falling outside the curve f(x). The x values of the points lying within the
curve form random numbers with the distribution e−x
2
. Here cg(x) not necessarily defined
in [0, 1]. It can be [0, 1.5] or [0, 2] or [0, > 1]. The number of points discarded to generate
N numbers with a required distribution depends on the choice of cg(x). The number of574 Random Number Generators for Desired Distributions
discarded points will be minimum if the maximum value of cg(x) is chosen as the maximum
value of f(x). Figure G.2b shows the probability distribution function P(x) of generated
random numbers.
